    "context": "34783668<SEP>Meghan S Nagpal<SEP>Patient-Generated Data Analytics of Health Behaviors of People Living With Type 2 Diabetes: Scoping Review<SEP>Background: Complications due to type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be mitigated through proper self-management that can positively change health behaviors. Technological tools are available to help people living with, or at risk of developing, T2D to manage their condition, and such tools provide a large repository of patient-generated health data (PGHD). Analytics can provide insights into the health behaviors of people living with T2D. Objective: The aim of this review is to investigate what can be learned about the health behaviors of those living with, or at risk of developing, T2D through analytics from PGHD. Methods: A scoping review using the Arksey and O'Malley framework was conducted in which a comprehensive search of the literature was conducted by 2 reviewers. In all, 3 electronic databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library) were searched using keywords associated with diabetes, behaviors, and analytics. Several rounds of screening using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria were conducted, after which studies were selected. Critical examination took place through a descriptive-analytical narrative method, and data extracted from the studies were classified into thematic categories. These categories reflect the findings of this study as per our objective. Results: We identified 43 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Although 70% (30/43) of the studies examined PGHD independently, 30% (13/43) combined PGHD with other data sources. Most of these studies used machine learning algorithms to perform their analysis. The themes identified through this review include predicting diabetes or obesity, deriving factors that contribute to diabetes or obesity, obtaining insights from social media or web-based forums, predicting glycemia, improving adherence and outcomes, analyzing sedentary behaviors, deriving behavior patterns, discovering clinical correlations from behaviors, and developing design principles. Conclusions: The increased volume and availability of PGHD have the potential to derive analytical insights into the health behaviors of people living with T2D. From the literature, we determined that analytics can predict outcomes and identify granular behavior patterns from PGHD. This review determined the broad range of insights that can be examined through PGHD, which constitutes a unique source of data for these applications that would not be possible through the use of other data sources.31169429<SEP>Rajendra Pradeepa<SEP>Use of Telemedicine Technologies in Diabetes Prevention and Control in Resource-Constrained Settings: Lessons Learned from Emerging Economies<SEP>Telemedicine is a promising strategy that utilizes telecommunication to provide health care in remote areas, facilitating beneficial interaction between the health care provider and people in rural areas and making affordable and accessible medical care available to remote, inaccessible areas of the world. This article provides an overview of some of the ways telemedicine is improving diabetes care outcomes at the community level. Telemedicine can play a number of roles in moving quality diabetes care forward. It is currently being used to create awareness among urban and rural population about the risk factors and prevention of diabetes; to facilitate patient monitoring; for remote diabetic retinopathy screening; and in diabetes prevention at the primary, secondary, and tertiary level. We also highlight the use of automated artificial intelligence software combined with telemedicine to conduct efficient real-time screening of complications such as diabetic retinopathy in remote areas where such facilities are currently unavailable.30182736<SEP>David Kerr<SEP>Digital Diabetes Data and Artificial Intelligence: A Time for Humility Not Hubris<SEP>In the future artificial intelligence (AI) will have the potential to improve outcomes diabetes care. With the creation of new sensors for physiological monitoring sensors and the introduction of smart insulin pens, novel data relationships based on personal phenotypic and genotypic information will lead to selections of tailored, effective therapies that will transform health care. However, decision-making processes based exclusively on quantitative metrics that ignore qualitative factors could create a quantitative fallacy. Difficult to quantify inputs into AI-based therapeutic decision-making processes include empathy, compassion, experience, and unconscious bias. Failure to consider these \"softer\" variables could lead to important errors. In other words, that which is not quantified about human health and behavior is still part of the calculus for determining therapeutic interventions.30269984<SEP>Sahar Ashrafzadeh<SEP>Patient-Driven Diabetes Care of the Future in the Technology Era<SEP>The growing burden of diabetes is fueled by obesity-inducing lifestyle behaviors including high-calorie diets and lack of physical activity. Challenges in access to diabetes specialists and educators, low adherence to medications, and inadequate motivational support for proper disease self-management contribute to poor glycemic control in patients with diabetes. Simultaneously, high patient volumes and low reimbursement rates limit physicians' time spent on lifestyle behavior counseling. These barriers to efficient diabetes care lead to high rates of diabetes-related complications, driving healthcare costs up and reducing the quality of patients' lives. Considering recent advancements in healthcare delivery technologies such as smartphone applications, telemedicine, m-health, device connectivity, machine-learning technology, and artificial intelligence, there is significant opportunity to achieve better efficiency in diabetes care and increase patient involvement in diabetes self-management, which ultimately may put an end to soaring diabetes-related healthcare expenditures. This review explores the patient-driven diabetes care of the future in the technology era.",
    "answer": "Diabetes is indeed categorized as a persistent ailment due to its chronic nature and long-term management requirements. Proper self-management and monitoring are crucial for individuals living with diabetes to mitigate complications and improve health outcomes. Various technological tools, such as patient-generated health data analytics, telemedicine, and artificial intelligence, are being used to enhance diabetes care and support patient self-management efforts. These technologies have the potential to provide valuable insights into health behaviors, predict outcomes, and identify behavior patterns that can aid in personalized and effective diabetes management. Therefore, the use of advanced technologies in diabetes care holds promise for improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs associated with diabetes-related complications.",

    "context": "30227185<SEP>Sophie K Kieffer<SEP>Temporal Changes in a Novel Metric of Physical Activity Tracking (Personal Activity Intelligence) and Mortality: The HUNT Study, Norway<SEP>Background: Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a novel activity metric that translates heart rate variations during exercise into a weekly score. Weekly PAI scores assessed at a single point in time were found to associate with lower risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the general healthy population. However, to date, the associations between long-term longitudinal changes in weekly PAI scores and mortality have not been explored. Purpose: The aim of the present study was to prospectively examine the association between change in weekly PAI scores estimated 10 years apart, and risk of mortality from CVD and all-causes. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of 11,870 men and 13,010 women without known CVD in Norway. By using data from the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT), PAI was estimated twice, ten years apart (HUNT1 1984-86 and HUNT2 1995-97). Mortality was followed-up until December 31, 2015. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for death from CVD and all-causes related to temporal changes in PAI were estimated using Cox regression analyses. Results: During a mean (SD) of 18 (4) years of follow-up, there were 4782 deaths, including 1560 deaths caused by CVD. Multi-adjusted analyses demonstrated that participants achieving a score of \u2265100 PAI at both time points had 32% lower risk of CVD mortality (AHR 0.68; CI: 0.54-0.86) for CVD mortality and 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality (AHR 0.80; CI: 71-0.91) compared with participants obtaining <100 weekly PAI at both measurements. For participants having <100 PAI in HUNT1 but \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2, the AHRs were 0.87 (CI: 0.74-1.03) for CVD mortality, and 0.86 (CI: 0.79-0.95) for all-cause mortality. We also found an inverse linear relationship between change in PAI and risk of CVD mortality among participants with 0 PAI (P < 0.01), and \u226450 PAI (P = 0.04) in HUNT1, indicating that an increase in PAI over time is associated with lower risk of mortality. Excluding the first three years of follow-up did not substantially alter the findings. Increasing PAI score from <100 PAI in HUNT1 to \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2 was associated with 6.6 years gained lifespan. Conclusion: Among men and women without known CVD, an increase in PAI score and sustained high PAI score over a 10-year period was associated with lower risk of mortality.28686749<SEP>Narendra K Arora<SEP>Setting research priorities for maternal, newborn, child health and nutrition in India by engaging experts from 256 indigenous institutions contributing over 4000 research ideas: a CHNRI exercise by ICMR and INCLEN<SEP>Background: Health research in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) is often driven by donor priorities rather than by the needs of the countries where the research takes place. This lack of alignment of donor's priorities with local research need may be one of the reasons why countries fail to achieve set goals for population health and nutrition. India has a high burden of morbidity and mortality in women, children and infants. In order to look forward toward the Sustainable Development Goals, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the INCLEN Trust International (INCLEN) employed the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative's (CHNRI) research priority setting method for maternal, neonatal, child health and nutrition with the timeline of 2016-2025. The exercise was the largest to-date use of the CHNRI methodology, both in terms of participants and ideas generated and also expanded on the methodology. Methods: CHNRI is a crowdsourcing-based exercise that involves using the collective intelligence of a group of stakeholders, usually researchers, to generate and score research options against a set of criteria. This paper reports on a large umbrella CHNRI that was divided into four theme-specific CHNRIs (maternal, newborn, child health and nutrition). A National Steering Group oversaw the exercise and four theme-specific Research Sub-Committees technically supported finalizing the scoring criteria and refinement of research ideas for the respective thematic areas. The exercise engaged participants from 256 institutions across India - 4003 research ideas were generated from 498 experts which were consolidated into 373 research options (maternal health: 122; newborn health: 56; child health: 101; nutrition: 94); 893 experts scored these against five criteria (answerability, relevance, equity, innovation and out-of-box thinking, investment on research). Relative weights to the criteria were assigned by 79 members from the Larger Reference Group. Given India's diversity, priorities were identified at national and three regional levels: (i) the Empowered Action Group (EAG) and North-Eastern States; (ii) States and Union territories in Northern India (including West Bengal); and (iii) States and Union territories in Southern and Western parts of India. Conclusions: The exercise leveraged the inherent flexibility of the CHNRI method in multiple ways. It expanded on the CHNRI methodology enabling analyses for identification of research priorities at national and regional levels. However, prioritization of research options are only valuable if they are put to use, and we hope that donors will take advantage of this prioritized list of research options.37270750<SEP>Marie Skov Breum<SEP>Estimation of separable direct and indirect effects in a continuous-time illness-death model<SEP>In this article we study the effect of a baseline exposure on a terminal time-to-event outcome either directly or mediated by the illness state of a continuous-time illness-death process with baseline covariates. We propose a definition of the corresponding direct and indirect effects using the concept of separable (interventionist) effects (Robins and Richardson in Causality and psychopathology: finding the determinants of disorders and their cures, Oxford University Press, 2011; Robins et al. in arXiv:2008.06019 , 2021; Stensrud et al. in J Am Stat Assoc 117:175-183, 2022). Our proposal generalizes Martinussen and Stensrud (Biometrics 79:127-139, 2023) who consider similar causal estimands for disentangling the causal treatment effects on the event of interest and competing events in the standard continuous-time competing risk model. Unlike natural direct and indirect effects (Robins and Greenland in Epidemiology 3:143-155, 1992; Pearl in Proceedings of the seventeenth conference on uncertainty in artificial intelligence, Morgan Kaufmann, 2001) which are usually defined through manipulations of the mediator independently of the exposure (so-called cross-world interventions), separable direct and indirect effects are defined through interventions on different components of the exposure that exert their effects through distinct causal mechanisms. This approach allows us to define meaningful mediation targets even though the mediating event is truncated by the terminal event. We present the conditions for identifiability, which include some arguably restrictive structural assumptions on the treatment mechanism, and discuss when such assumptions are valid. The identifying functionals are used to construct plug-in estimators for the separable direct and indirect effects. We also present multiply robust and asymptotically efficient estimators based on the efficient influence functions. We verify the theoretical properties of the estimators in a simulation study, and we demonstrate the use of the estimators using data from a Danish registry study.30227185<SEP>Sophie K Kieffer<SEP>Temporal Changes in a Novel Metric of Physical Activity Tracking (Personal Activity Intelligence) and Mortality: The HUNT Study, Norway<SEP>Background: Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a novel activity metric that translates heart rate variations during exercise into a weekly score.

    "answer": "Based on the information provided in the context, it can be inferred that regular physical activity, as measured by the Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) metric, can indeed lower the likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality. The study conducted on 11,870 men and 13,010 women in Norway demonstrated that participants achieving a PAI score of \u2265100 at both time points had a 32% lower risk of CVD mortality and a 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to those with <100 PAI scores. Additionally, an increase in PAI score over a 10-year period was associated with a lower risk of mortality, indicating the importance of sustained high PAI scores for reducing mortality risk, including from CVD.\n\nTherefore, based on the findings from the study, it can be concluded that regular physical activity, as measured by PAI, is indeed associated with a lower likelihood of cardiovascular disease and overall mortality. Consistently maintaining a high PAI score over time can have significant benefits for reducing the risk of CVD and improving overall health outcomes.",

    "question": "Is asthma recognized as a respiratory ailment?",
    "context": "36127649<SEP>Hassan Joumaa<SEP>Artificial intelligence to differentiate asthma from COPD in medico-administrative databases<SEP>Introduction: Discriminating asthma from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using medico-administrative databases is challenging but necessary for medico-economic analyses focusing on respiratory diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) may improve dedicated algorithms. Objectives: To assess performance of different AI-based approaches to distinguish asthmatics from COPD patients in medico-administrative databases where the clinical diagnosis is absent. An \"Asthma COPD Overlap\" category was defined to further test whether AI can detect complexity. Methods: This study included 178,962 patients treated by two \"R03\" treatment prescriptions at least from January 2016 to December 2018 and managed by either a general practitioner and/or a pulmonologist participating in a permanent longitudinal observatory of prescription in ambulatory medicine (LPD). Clinical diagnoses are available in this database and were used as gold standards to develop diagnostic rules. Three types of AI approaches were explored using data restricted to demographics and treatment dispensations: multinomial regression, gradient boosting and recurrent neural networks (RNN). The best performing model (based on metric properties) was then applied to estimate the size of asthma and COPD populations based on a database (LRx) of treatment dispensations between July, 2018 and June, 2019. Results: The best models were obtained with the boosting approach and RNN, with an overall accuracy of 68%. Performance metrics were better for asthma than COPD. Based on LRx data, the extrapolated numbers of patients treated for asthma and COPD in France were 3.7 and 1.2 million, respectively. Asthma patients were younger than COPD patients (mean, 49.9 vs. 72.1 years); COPD occurred mostly in men (68%) compared to asthma (33%). Conclusion: AI can provide models with acceptable accuracy to distinguish between asthma, ACO and COPD in medico-administrative databases where the clinical diagnosis is absent. Deep learning and machine learning (RNN) had similar performances in this regard.34914601<SEP>Konstantinos Exarchos<SEP>Review of Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease<SEP>Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has proven to be an invaluable asset in the healthcare domain, where massive amounts of data are produced. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous chronic condition with multiscale manifestations and complex interactions that represents an ideal target for AI. Objective: The aim of this review article is to appraise the adoption of AI in COPD research, and more specifically its applications to date along with reported results, potential challenges and future prospects. Methods: We performed a review of the literature from PubMed and DBLP and assembled studies published up to 2020, yielding 156 articles relevant to the scope of this review. Results: The resulting articles were assessed and organized into four basic contextual categories, namely: i) 'COPD diagnosis', ii) 'COPD prognosis', iii) 'Patient classification', iv) 'COPD management', and subsequently presented in an orderly manner based on a set of qualitative and quantitative criteria. Conclusions: We observed considerable acceleration of research activity utilizing AI techniques in COPD research, especially in the last couple of years, nevertheless, the massive production of large and complex data in COPD calls for broader adoption of AI and more advanced techniques.34220314<SEP>Yinhe Feng<SEP>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Chronic Airway Diseases: Focus on Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease<SEP>Chronic airway diseases are characterized by airway inflammation, obstruction, and remodeling and show high prevalence, especially in developing countries. Among them, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) show the highest morbidity and socioeconomic burden worldwide. Although there are extensive guidelines for the prevention, early diagnosis, and rational treatment of these lifelong diseases, their value in precision medicine is very limited. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as effective methods for mining and integrating large-scale, heterogeneous medical data for clinical practice, and several AI and ML methods have recently been applied to asthma and COPD. However, very few methods have significantly contributed to clinical practice. Here, we review four aspects of AI and ML implementation in asthma and COPD to summarize existing knowledge and indicate future steps required for the safe and effective application of AI and ML tools by clinicians.36776483<SEP>Eva Topole<SEP>Artificial intelligence based software facilitates spirometry quality control in asthma and COPD clinical trials<SEP>Rationale: Acquiring high-quality spirometry data in clinical trials is important, particularly when using forced expiratory volume in 1 s or forced vital capacity as primary end-points. In addition to quantitative criteria, the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) standards include subjective evaluation which introduces inter-rater variability and potential mistakes. We explored the value of artificial intelligence (AI)-based software (ArtiQ.QC) to assess spirometry quality and compared it to traditional over-reading control. Methods: A random sample of 2000 sessions (8258 curves) was selected from Chiesi COPD and asthma trials (n=1000 per disease). Acceptability using the 2005 ATS/ERS standards was determined by over-reader review and by ArtiQ.QC. Additionally, three respiratory physicians jointly reviewed a subset of curves (n=150). Results: The majority of curves (n=7267, 88%) were of good quality. The AI agreed with over-readers in 91% of cases, with 97% sensitivity and 93% positive predictive value. Performance was significantly better in the asthma group. In the revised subset, n=50 curves were repeated to assess intra-rater reliability (\u03ba=0.83, 0.86 and 0.80 for each of the three reviewers). All reviewers agreed on 63% of 100 unique tests (\u03ba=0.5). When reviewers set the consensus (gold standard), individual agreement with it was 88%, 94% and 70%. The agreement between AI and \"gold-standard\" was 73%; over-reader agreement was 46%. Conclusion: AI-based software can be used to measure spirometry data quality with comparable accuracy as experts. The assessment is a subjective exercise, with intra- and inter-rater variability even when the criteria are defined very precisely and objectively. By providing consistent results and immediate feedback to the sites, AI may benefit clinical trial conduct and variability reduction.",

    "question": "Does smoking elevate the risk of lung cancer?",
    "context": "36617923<SEP>Chinese Thoracic Society<SEP>[Chinese expert consensus on diagnosis of early lung cancer (2023 Edition)]<SEP>Lung cancer is the leading cause of the incidence and mortality of malignant tumors in our country, seriously endangering people's lives and health. The treatment of lung cancer has made great progress in the past 10 years, and the 5-year survival rate of lung cancer in China has also increased from 16.1% to 19.7%, but about 75% of patients are still in advanced stages of lung cancer at the time of diagnosis, missing the best time for radical surgery. Early diagnosis can significantly improve the prognosis and survival of lung cancer patients. From the 5-year survival rate of lung cancer patients, it can be seen that the 5-year survival rate of stage \u2160 patients was 77%-92%, while that of stage \u2162A-\u2163A patients was only 10%-36%, and there was a significant difference in the 5-year survival rate. Studies have shown that early-diagnosed and completely resected lung adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) have 5-year disease-specific survival rates of 100% and 100%, respectively. Early diagnosis is the key to improving the prognosis of lung cancer. In order to further improve the level of early lung cancer diagnosis in China, especially the standardization in the diagnosis and evaluation of pulmonary nodules and early lung cancer, experts from the Lung Cancer Group of Chinese Thoracic Society formulated the \"Chinese Expert Consensus on Diagnosis of Early Lung Cancer (2023 Edition)\", on the basis of the actual situation in the field of diagnosis and treatment, with reference to the latest research data and relevant guidelines at home and abroad. Consensus on the application of artificial intelligence, big data and robotics, the Internet of Things and multidisciplinary cooperation in the diagnosis of early lung cancer, the management of pulmonary nodules and follow-up strategies for suspected early lung cancer, etc., were respectively recommended to provide references for clinicians in the diagnosis of early lung cancer, in order to further promote the early diagnosis of lung cancer in China.37263180<SEP>Yanwei Zhang<SEP>China lung cancer screening (CLUS) version 2.0 with new techniques implemented: Artificial intelligence, circulating molecular biomarkers and autofluorescence bronchoscopy<SEP>Objective: The present study, CLUS version 2.0, was conducted to evaluate the performance of new techniques in improving the implementation of lung cancer screening and to validate the efficacy of LDCT in reducing lung cancer-specific mortality in a high-risk Chinese population. Methods: From July 2018 to February 2019, high-risk participants from six screening centers in Shanghai were enrolled in our study. Artificial intelligence, circulating molecular biomarkers and autofluorescencebronchoscopy were applied during screening. Results: A total of 5087 eligible high-risk participants were enrolled in the study; 4490 individuals were invited, and 4395 participants (97.9%) finally underwent LDCT detection. Positive screening results were observed in 857 (19.5%) participants. Solid nodules represented 53.6% of all positive results, while multiple nodules were the most common location type (26.8%). Up to December 2020, 77 participants received lung resection or biopsy, including 70 lung cancers, 2 mediastinal tumors, 1 tracheobronchial tumor, 1 malignant pleural mesothelioma and 3 benign nodules. Lung cancer patients accounted for 1.6% of all the screened participants, and 91.4% were in the early stage (stage 0-1). Conclusions: LDCT screening can detect a high proportion of early-stage lung cancer patients in a Chinese high-risk population. The utilization of new techniques would be conducive to improving the implementation of LDCT screening.33718054<SEP>Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez<SEP>Molecular biomarkers in early stage lung cancer<SEP>Low dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening, together with the recent advances in targeted and immunotherapies, have shown to improve non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) survival. Furthermore, screening has increased the number of early stage-detected tumors, allowing for surgical resection and multimodality treatments when needed. The need for improved sensitivity and specificity of NSCLC screening has led to increased interest in combining clinical and radiological data with molecular data. The development of biomarkers is poised to refine inclusion criteria for LDCT screening programs. Biomarkers may also be useful to better characterize the risk of indeterminate nodules found in the course of screening or to refine prognosis and help in the management of screening detected tumors. The clinical implications of these biomarkers are still being investigated and whether or not biomarkers will be included in further decision-making algorithms in the context of screening and early lung cancer management still needs to be determined. However, it seems clear that there is much room for improvement even in early stage lung cancer disease-free survival (DFS) rates; thus, biomarkers may be the key to refine risk-stratification and treatment of these patients. Clinicians' capacity to register, integrate, and analyze all the available data in both high risk individuals and early stage NSCLC patients will lead to a better understanding of the disease's mechanisms, and will have a direct impact in diagnosis, treatment, and follow up of these patients. In this review, we aim to summarize all the available data regarding the role of biomarkers in LDCT screening and early stage NSCLC from a multidisciplinary perspective. We have highlighted clinical implications, the need to combine risk stratification, clinical data, radiomics, molecular information and artificial intelligence in order to improve clinical decision-making, especially regarding early diagnostics and adjuvant therapy. We also discuss current and future perspectives for biomarker implementation in routine clinical practice.33571312<SEP>Witness Mapanga<SEP>Consensus study on the health system and patient-related barriers for lung cancer management in South Africa<SEP>Background: Lung cancer is the highest incident cancer globally and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality particularly if identified at a late stage. Poor patient outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC's) might reflect contextual patient and health system constraints at multiple levels, that act as barriers to prevention, disease recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. Lung cancer screening, even for high-risk patients, is not available in the public health sector in South Africa (SA), where the current HIV and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics often take precedence. Yet, there has been no formal assessment of the individual and health-system related barriers that may delay patients with lung cancer from seeking and accessing help within the public health care system and receiving the appropriate and effective diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to derive consensus from health-system stakeholders in the urban Gauteng Province of SA on the most important challenges faced by the health services and patients in achieving optimum lung cancer management and to identify potential solutions. Methods: The study was undertaken among 27 participant stakeholders representing clinical managers, clinicians, opinion leaders from the public health sector and non-governmental organisation (NGO) representatives. The study compromised two components: consensus and engagement. For the consensus component, the Delphi Technique was employed with open-ended questions and item ranking from five rounds of consensus-seeking, to achieve collective agreement on the most important challenges faced by patients and the health services in achieving optimal lung cancer management. For the engagement component, the Nominal Group Technique was used to articulate ideas and reach an agreement on the group's recommendations for solution strategies and approaches. Results: Public health sector stakeholders suggested that a lack of knowledge and awareness of lung cancer, and the apparent stigma associated with the disease and its risk factors, as well as symptoms and signs, are critical to treatment delay. Furthermore, delays in up-referral of patients with suspected lung cancer from district health care level were attributed to inadequate knowledge arising from a lack of in-service training of nurses and doctors regarding oncologic symptoms, risk factors, need for further investigation, interpretation of x-rays and available treatments. At a tertiary level, participants suggested that insufficient availability of specialised diagnostic resources (imaging, cytological and pathological services including biomolecular assessment of lung cancer), theatres, cardiothoracic surgeons, and appropriate therapeutic modalities (chemotherapeutic agents and radiation oncology) are the main barriers to the provision of optimal care. It was suggested that a primary prevention programme initiated by the government that involves private-public partnerships may improve lung cancer management nationally. Conclusions: Considerable barriers to the early identification and treatment of lung cancer exist. Finding solutions to overcome both individual and health-system level obstacles to lung cancer screening and management are vital to facilitate early identification and treatment, and to improve survival. Furthermore, research on inexpensive biomarkers for asymptomatic disease detection, the introduction of diagnostic imaging tools that utilise artificial intelligence to compensate for inadequate human resources and improving clinical integration across all levels of the healthcare system are essential.",

Therefore, smoking does elevate the risk of lung cancer, especially if not diagnosed early. It is important to increase awareness and focus on early screening and detection to improve outcomes for individuals at risk of developing lung cancer.",

    "context": "25959123<SEP>Calum D Moulton<SEP>Factors associated with cognitive impairment in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: a cross-sectional study<SEP>Objectives: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is strongly associated with cognitive impairment but the factors within T2DM that predispose to cognitive impairment are less well understood, while previous studies have investigated samples with T2DM of widely varying duration. We aimed to investigate the factors associated with cognitive impairment in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. Method: In a multi-ethnic sample with T2DM diagnosed in the last 6 months, we assessed cognitive function using the 13-item modified telephone interview for cognitive status (TICS-M). Cognitive function was assessed both categorically (impairment defined as lowest 10% of scores with the remainder as controls) and as continuous TICS-M score. Its associations were tested in univariate and multivariate analyses with a range of biological, psychological and sociodemographic factors. Results: Of 1790 participants, 1680 had a complete TICS-M assessment at baseline. After controlling for covariates, older age (p < 0.001) and lower verbal intelligence (p < 0.001) were associated with both cognitive impairment and lower TICS-M scores, while non-white ethnicity (p < 0.001), female gender (p = 0.02) and higher HbA1c (p = 0.002) were associated with lower TICS-M scores. Depression (defined as Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score \u226510), elevated inflammatory markers and body mass index were not associated with cognitive function after controlling for covariates. Conclusion: Age, verbal intelligence, female gender and HbA1c are associated with cognitive performance in T2DM soon after diagnosis. Previously reported associations with depression and inflammatory markers may occur later as causes or consequences of T2DM. Longitudinal analyses are needed to assess potentially modifiable factors predicting cognitive decline in early T2DM.27690485<SEP>Christopher M Ryan<SEP>Neurocognitive consequences of diabetes<SEP>Mild cognitive dysfunction is a well-established complication of diabetes and its management, although large numbers of psychologists and health professionals may be unaware of its existence, clinical implications, and etiology. Drawing on results from key studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, this article delineates the neurocognitive phenotypes characteristic of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), and identifies the most plausible risk factors, both those that may be modifiable, like degree of metabolic control, and those that cannot be changed, like the age when a child or adult is diagnosed. Most children and adults with T1D typically manifest lower scores on measures of intelligence and academic achievement, attention, psychomotor speed, and executive functions. These effects are especially pronounced in those who develop diabetes early in life, before the age of 6 or 7 years. Chronically elevated blood glucose values increase the risk of both cognitive dysfunction and microstructural changes in white matter tracts. Adults with T2D manifest cognitive dysfunction characterized by poorer performance on tasks requiring attention, psychomotor speed, planning and executive functions, and learning and memory. They are also at increased risk of developing dementia. Poorer metabolic control accelerates the rate of cognitive decline over time, and research suggests that improving metabolic control may slow the rate of decline. Psychologists and behavioral scientists can play a key role in preventing the onset of cognitive complications or in ameliorating their severity by implementing behavioral strategies known to increase adherence to medical regimens and improve metabolic control. (PsycINFO Database Record28041947<SEP>Sarah E MacPherson<SEP>Cognitive reserve and cognitive performance of patients with focal frontal lesions<SEP>The Cognitive reserve (CR) hypothesis was put forward to account for the variability in cognitive performance of patients with similar degrees of brain pathology. Compensatory neural activity within the frontal lobes has often been associated with CR. For the first time we investigated the independent effects of two CR proxies, education and NART IQ, on measures of executive function, fluid intelligence, speed of information processing, verbal short term memory (vSTM), naming, and perception in a sample of 86 patients with focal, unilateral frontal lesions and 142 healthy controls. We fitted multiple linear regression models for each of the cognitive measures and found that only NART IQ predicted executive and naming performance. Neither education nor NART IQ predicted performance on fluid intelligence, processing speed, vSTM or perceptual abilities. Education and NART IQ did not modify the effect of lesion severity on cognitive impairment. We also found that age significantly predicted performance on executive tests and the majority of our other cognitive measures, except vSTM and GNT. Age was the only predictor for fluid intelligence. This latter finding suggests that age plays a role in executive performance over and above the contribution of CR proxies in patients with focal frontal lesions. Overall, our results suggest that the CR proxies do not appear to modify the relationship between cognitive impairment and frontal lesions.31233379<SEP>Victoria M Leavitt<SEP>Dissociable cognitive patterns related to depression and anxiety in multiple sclerosis<SEP>Background: Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) frequently present with depression and anxiety, as well as cognitive impairment, challenging clinicians to disentangle interrelationships among these symptoms. Objective: To identify cognitive functions associated with anxiety and depression in MS. Methods: Mood and cognition were measured in 185 recently diagnosed patients (Reserve Against Disability in Early Multiple Sclerosis (RADIEMS) cohort), and an independent validation sample (MEM CONNECT cohort, n = 70). Partial correlations evaluated relationships of cognition to anxiety and depression controlling for age, sex, education, and premorbid verbal intelligence. Results: In RADIEMS cohort, lower anxiety was associated with better nonverbal memory (rp = -0.220, p = 0.003) and lower depression to better attention/processing speed (rp = -0.241, p = 0.001). Consistently, in MEM CONNECT cohort, lower anxiety was associated with better nonverbal memory (rp = -0.271, p = 0.028) and lower depression to better attention/processing speed (rp = -0.367, p = 0.002). Relationships were unchanged after controlling for T2 lesion volume and fatigue. Conclusion: Consistent mood-cognition relationships were identified in two independent cohorts of MS patients, suggesting that cognitive correlates of anxiety and depression are separable. This dissociation may support more precise models to inform treatment development. Treatment of mood symptoms may mitigate effects on cognition and/or treatment of cognition may mitigate effects on mood.",
    "answer": "Yes, obesity is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. This can be seen from the context provided, where factors such as higher HbA1c levels were associated with lower cognitive function in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Additionally, individuals with Type 2 diabetes are at an increased risk of developing cognitive dysfunction and cognitive decline, which is a well-established complication of diabetes management. Therefore, maintaining a healthy weight and managing obesity can help reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and associated cognitive impairments.",

    "context": "37892991<SEP>Vicentiu Mircea Saceleanu<SEP>Integrative Approaches in Acute Ischemic Stroke: From Symptom Recognition to Future Innovations<SEP>Among the high prevalence of cerebrovascular diseases nowadays, acute ischemic stroke stands out, representing a significant worldwide health issue with important socio-economic implications. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are important milestones for the management of this multifaceted pathology, making understanding the various stroke-onset symptoms crucial. A key role in acute ischemic stroke management is emphasizing the essential role of a multi-disciplinary team, therefore, increasing the efficiency of recognition and treatment. Neuroimaging and neuroradiology have evolved dramatically over the years, with multiple approaches that provide a higher understanding of the morphological aspects as well as timely recognition of cerebral artery occlusions for effective therapy planning. Regarding the treatment matter, the pharmacological approach, particularly fibrinolytic therapy, has its merits and challenges. Endovascular thrombectomy, a game-changer in stroke management, has witnessed significant advances, with technologies like stent retrievers and aspiration catheters playing pivotal roles. For select patients, combining pharmacological and endovascular strategies offers evidence-backed benefits. The aim of our comprehensive study on acute ischemic stroke is to efficiently compare the current therapies, recognize novel possibilities from the literature, and describe the state of the art in the interdisciplinary approach to acute ischemic stroke. As we aspire for holistic patient management, the emphasis is not just on medical intervention but also on physical therapy, mental health, and community engagement. The future holds promising innovations, with artificial intelligence poised to reshape stroke diagnostics and treatments. Bridging the gap between groundbreaking research and clinical practice remains a challenge, urging continuous collaboration and research.37857099<SEP>Ines Ben Alaya<SEP>Automatic triaging of acute ischemic stroke patients for reperfusion therapies using Artificial Intelligence methods and multiple MRI features: A review<SEP>Background: The selection of appropriate treatments for Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS), including Intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and Mechanical thrombectomy, is a critical aspect of clinical decision-making. Timely treatment is essential, with recommended administration of therapies within 4.5 h of symptom onset. However, patients with unknown Time Since Stroke (TSS), are often excluded from thrombolysis, even if the stroke onset exceeds 6 h. Current clinical guidelines propose using multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to assess various mismatches. Methods: The review explores the significance of automatic methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms that utilize multiple MRI features to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from acute reperfusion therapies. These AI methods include TSS classification and patient selection for therapies in the late time window (>6 h) using MRI images to provide detailed stroke information. Results: The review discusses the challenges and limitations in the existing mismatch methods, which may lead to missed opportunities for reperfusion therapy. To address these limitations, AI approaches have been developed to enhance accuracy and support clinical decision-making. These AI methods have shown promising results, outperforming traditional mismatch assessments and providing improved sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients eligible for reperfusion therapies. Discussion: In summary, the integration of AI algorithms utilizing multiple MRI features has the potential to enhance accuracy, improve patient outcomes, and positively influence the decision-making process in AIS. However, ongoing research and collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and technologists are vital to realize the full potential of AI in optimizing stroke management.35118879<SEP>Xiang Li<SEP>Automated ASPECTS in acute ischemic stroke: comparison of the overall scores and Hounsfield unit values of two software packages and radiologists with different levels of experience<SEP>Background: ASPECTS is a simple, rapid, and semi-quantitative method for detecting early ischemic changes (EIC). However, the agreement between software applications and neuroradiologists varies greatly. Purpose: To compare ASPECTS calculated by using automated software tools to neuroradiologists evaluation in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Material and methods: Retrospectively, 61 patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) who underwent multimodal stroke computed tomography (CT) were evaluated using two automated ASPECTS software tools (NSK and RAPID) and three neuroradiologists with different experiences (two senior neuroradiologists and one junior neuroradiologist). Four weeks later, the same three neuroradiologists re-evaluated the ASPECTS in consensus using the baseline CT and follow-up non-contrast CT (NCCT). Interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Pearson correlation coefficients were applied for statistical analysis. Results: The HU value exhibited the greatest correlation in the insular lobe (r = 0.81; P < 0.001) and the lowest correlation in the internal capsule (r = 0.65; P < 0.001) between NSK and RAPID. Software analysis and human readers showed excellent agreement with the consensus reading. Compared with the consensus reading, the correlation of the two senior radiologists (ICC = 0.975 and 0.969, respectively) were higher than that of junior radiologist (ICC = 0.869), and the consistency values of the NSK and RAPID software tools after 6 h of onset to imaging (ICC = 0.894 and 0.874, respectively) were greater than those within 6 h of onset (ICC = 0.746 and 0.828, respectively). Conclusion: For patients experiencing AIS due to LVO, the ASPECTS calculated with automated software agrees well with the predefined consensus score but is inferior to that of senior radiologists.37668701<SEP>Stanislas Demuth<SEP>Strokecopilot: a literature-based clinical decision support system for acute ischemic stroke treatment<SEP>Background: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is an immediate emergency whose management is becoming more and more personalized while facing a limited number of neurologists with high expertise. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are digital tools leveraging information and artificial intelligence technologies. Here, we present the Strokecopilot project, a CDSS for the management of the acute phase of AIS. It has been designed to support the evidence-based medicine reasoning of neurologists regarding the indications of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular treatments (ET). Methods: Reference populations were manually extracted from the field's main guidelines and randomized clinical trials (RCT). Their characteristics were harmonized in a computerized reference database. We developed a web application whose algorithm identifies the reference populations matching the patient's characteristics. It returns the latter's outcomes in a graphical user interface (GUI), whose design has been driven by real-world practices. Results: Strokecopilot has been released at www.digitalneurology.net . The reference database includes 25 reference populations from 2 guidelines and 15 RCTs. After a request, the reference populations matching the patient characteristics are displayed with a summary and a meta-analysis of their results. The status regarding IVT and ET indications are presented as \"in guidelines\", \"in literature\", or \"outside literature references\". The GUI is updated to provide several levels of explanation. Strokecopilot may be updated as the literature evolves by loading a new version of the reference populations' database. Conclusion: Strokecopilot is a literature-based CDSS, developed to support neurologists in the management of the acute phase of AIS.",
    "answer": "Yes, hypertension can result in a stroke. Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a significant risk factor for stroke. Persistent high blood pressure can damage the blood vessels over time, leading to atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries) and increased risk of blood clots. These blood clots can block blood flow to the brain, causing an ischemic stroke. Additionally, hypertension can weaken the blood vessel walls, making them more prone to rupture and causing a hemorrhagic stroke. Therefore, managing hypertension through lifestyle changes and medication is crucial in reducing the risk of stroke.",

Many cancer medicines have cardiotoxic effects but the size of the population exposed to these potentially cardiotoxic medicines is not known. We aimed to determine the prevalence of exposure to potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicines in Australia. Methods: We identified potentially cardiotoxic systemic cancer medicines through searching the literature and registered product information documents. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Australians dispensed potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicines between 2005 and 2021, calculating age-standardised annual prevalence rates of people alive with exposure to a potentially cardiotoxic medicine during or prior to each year of the study period. Findings: We identified 108,175 people dispensed at least one potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicine; median age, 64 (IQR: 52-74); 57% female. Overall prevalence increased from 49 (95%CI: 48.7-49.3)/10,000 to 232 (95%CI: 231.4-232.6)/10,000 over the study period; 61 (95%CI: 60.5-61.5)/10,000 to 293 (95%CI: 292.1-293.9)/10,000 for females; and 39 (95%CI: 38.6-39.4)/10,000 to 169 (95%CI: 168.3-169.7)/10,000 for males.

In Europe, cancer will soon be the leading cause of death, ahead of cardiovascular disease. Concerted efforts at the scientific, medical, societal, and political levels are required to address this problem on a global scale. High-quality oncological imaging is of particular importance in this regard. Access to it has been shown to have a significant impact on quality of care and survival. Imaging is an essential component of screening and early detection. In clinical oncology, imaging is essential for multidisciplinary diagnostics and personalized therapy. Likewise, imaging is necessary in translational and clinical research. Imaging techniques are also themselves the subject of research and development and, associated with this, are also of great importance as an economic factor. This article aims to provide insights into the global problem of oncology and the contribution that oncological imaging can make to its management.36927888<SEP>Wolfgang Sadee<SEP>Pharmacogenomics: Driving Personalized Medicine<SEP>Objective: To observe the effect of surgical procedures and general anesthesia exposure (35369354<SEP>Jennifer M Kwan<SEP>Multimodality Advanced Cardiovascular and Molecular Imaging for Early Detection and Monitoring of Cancer Therapy-Associated Cardiotoxicity and the Role of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data<SEP>Cancer mortality has improved due to earlier detection via screening, as well as due to novel cancer therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitions. However, similarly to older cancer therapies such as anthracyclines, these therapies have also been documented to cause cardiotoxic events including cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, arrhythmia, hypertension, and thrombosis. Imaging modalities such as echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are critical in monitoring and evaluating for cardiotoxicity from these treatments, as well as in providing information for the assessment of function and wall motion abnormalities. MRI also allows for additional tissue characterization using T1, T2, extracellular volume (ECV), and delayed gadolinium enhancement (DGE) assessment. Furthermore, emerging technologies may be able to assist with these efforts. Nuclear imaging using targeted radiotracers, some of which are already clinically used, may have more specificity and help provide information on the mechanisms of cardiotoxicity, including in anthracycline mediated cardiomyopathy and checkpoint inhibitor myocarditis. Hyperpolarized MRI may be used to evaluate the effects of oncologic therapy on cardiac metabolism. Lastly, artificial intelligence and big data of imaging modalities may help predict and detect early signs of cardiotoxicity and response to cardioprotective medications as well as provide insights on the added value of molecular imaging and correlations with cardiovascular outcomes. In this review, the current imaging modalities used to assess for cardiotoxicity from cancer treatments are discussed, in addition to ongoing research on targeted molecular radiotracers, hyperpolarized MRI, as well as the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data in imaging that would help improve the detection and prognostication of cancer-treatment cardiotoxicity.",

They include long-acting injected (LAI) drug formulations, behavioral interventions, and technology-supported methods. Use of LAI antipsychotics and behavioral techniques aimed at incorporating medicine-taking into daily routines with electronic monitoring have been assessed relatively extensively. Mobile, digital applications including medication monitoring systems and artificial intelligence-based interactions are emerging but have been tested in few trials of limited quality with inconclusive results. Randomized, controlled, blinded trials based on clinically representative samples are needed to evaluate not only adherence, but also to test for clinically meaningful and sustained clinical benefits in schizophrenia patients, who are especially difficult to treat.34994733<SEP>Jerzy Samochowiec<SEP>Polish Psychiatric Association consensus statement on non-pharmacological methods in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia<SEP>This consensus statement has been prepared by a group of experts consisting of professionals with long experience in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, who were appointed by the Management Board of the Polish Psychiatric Association. The evaluation involved the analysis of literature databases and information derived from meta-analyses of these data for years 2010-2020. The searched publications were in English, German and Polish language versions and involved interventions performed in groups of adult patients. The efficacy of nonpharmacological methods applied for treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia were compared with effects of adifferent treatment/combined treatment/a group with no intervention. When formulating the recommendations, the experts analysed the source data in terms of their application in the Polish conditions. The current recommendations of academic societies and literature on the treatment of schizophrenia with predominant negative symptoms were taken into account. The experts included items that involved a comparison of a study group in terms of non-pharmacological interventions, and pharmacologically treated cases were taken into account only when divisions were made into standard treatment and additional intervention. The results were divided into 7 sections: 1. Psychoeducation, 2. Psychotherapy (individual, group and family therapy), 3. Psychiatric rehabilitation, 4. Emotional intelligence, social skills and mindfulness training, 5. Cognitive remediation/rehabilitation, cognitive training, 6.

The use of mobile health services increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and their role in improving mental health is becoming clearer. Objective: This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of a smartphone app (MedAdhere) on medication adherence and accuracy among patients with schizophrenia and to measure their psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functions. Methods: In this 12-week experimental study, participants were provided interventions with the MedAdhere app, and data were collected between June 2021 and September 2022. A total of 105 participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control groups. We used the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Mini-Mental State Examination to measure the participants' psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functions. Generalized estimating equations were used for data analysis. Results: A total of 94 participants met the inclusion criteria and completed the protocol, and the medication adherence rate of the experimental group was 94.72% (2785/2940) during the intervention. Psychotic symptoms (positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptoms) and cognitive functions (memory, language, and executive function) were significantly improved in the experimental group compared to the control group after the intervention. Conclusions: The MedAdhere app effectively and significantly improved medication adherence and, thereby, the psychiatric symptoms of patients with schizophrenia. This artificial intelligence assisted app could be extended to all patients who need to be reminded to take medication on schedule.

This clinical presentation, chronic and highly disabling, is known as treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). The causes of treatment resistance and their relationships with causes underlying schizophrenia are largely unknown. Adequately powered genetic studies of TRS are scarce because of the difficulty in collecting data from well-characterized TRS cohorts. Objective: To examine the genetic architecture of TRS through the reassessment of genetic data from schizophrenia studies and its validation in carefully ascertained clinical samples. Design, setting, and participants: Two case-control genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of schizophrenia were performed in which the case samples were defined as individuals with TRS (n = 10 501) and individuals with non-TRS (n = 20 325). The differences in effect sizes for allelic associations were then determined between both studies, the reasoning being such differences reflect treatment resistance instead of schizophrenia. Genotype data were retrieved from the CLOZUK and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) schizophrenia studies. The output was validated using polygenic risk score (PRS) profiling of 2 independent schizophrenia cohorts with TRS and non-TRS: a prevalence sample with 817 individuals (Cardiff Cognition in Schizophrenia [CardiffCOGS]) and an incidence sample with 563 individuals (Genetics Workstream of the Schizophrenia Treatment Resistance and Therapeutic Advances [STRATA-G]). Main outcomes and measures: GWAS of treatment resistance in schizophrenia. The results of the GWAS were compared with complex polygenic traits through a genetic correlation approach and were used for PRS analysis on the independent validation cohorts using the same TRS definition. Results: The study included a total of 85 490 participants (48 635 [56.9%] male) in its GWAS stage and 1380 participants (859 [62.2%] male) in its PRS validation stage. Treatment resistance in schizophrenia emerged as a polygenic trait with detectable heritability (1% to 4%), and several traits related to intelligence and cognition were found to be genetically correlated with it (genetic correlation, 0.41-0.69). PRS analysis in the CardiffCOGS prevalence sample showed a positive association between TRS and a history of taking clozapine (r2 = 2.03%; P = .001), which was replicated in the STRATA-G incidence sample (r2 = 1.09%; P = .04). Conclusions and relevance: In this GWAS, common genetic variants were differentially associated with TRS, and these associations may have been obscured through the amalgamation of large GWAS samples in previous studies of broadly defined schizophrenia. Findings of this study suggest the validity of meta-analytic approaches for studies on patient outcomes, including treatment resistance.",

    "context": "34223026<SEP>Lesley Cooper<SEP>Supporting global antimicrobial stewardship: antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of surgical site infection in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs): a scoping review and meta-analysis<SEP>Background: The Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group is supporting two hospitals in Ghana to develop antimicrobial stewardship. Early intelligence gathering suggested that surgical prophylaxis was suboptimal. We reviewed the evidence for use of surgical prophylaxis to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to inform this work. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL and Google Scholar were searched from inception to 17 February 2020 for trials, audits, guidelines and systematic reviews in English. Grey literature, websites and reference lists of included studies were searched. Randomized clinical trials reporting incidence of SSI following Caesarean section were included in two meta-analyses. Narrative analysis of studies that explored behaviours and attitudes was conducted. Results: This review included 51 studies related to SSI and timing of antibiotic prophylaxis in LMICs. Incidence of SSI is higher in LMICs, infection surveillance data are poor and there is a lack of local guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis. Education to improve appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with reduction of SSI in LMICs. The random-effects pooled mean risk ratio of SSI in Caesarean section was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.51-1.17) for pre-incision versus post-incision prophylaxis and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.55-1.14) for short versus long duration. Reduction in cost and nurse time was reported in shorter-duration surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. Conclusions: There is scope for improvement, but interventions must include local context and address strongly held beliefs. Establishment of local multidisciplinary teams will promote ownership and sustainability of change.38259418<SEP>Dimple Kubde<SEP>Importance of Hospital Infection Control<SEP>The increasing demand for healthcare-acquired infection (HAI) control practices and services has intensified the need to evaluate care quality. The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced an infection prevention and control (IPC) framework to mitigate the impact of HAIs, crucial for ensuring patient safety in hospitals. HAIs acquired after hospitalization pose significant challenges due to factors such as compromised immunity, invasive medical procedures, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which have dire consequences, including higher mortality rates and increased healthcare costs. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are critical in implementing IPC measures. Infection control programs that include strategies such as hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE), environmental cleaning, and surveillance have become standard. However, challenges such as resistance to change, resource limitations, patient turnover, and variability in patient conditions persist. Strategies to maintain hospital infection control involve rigorous compliance monitoring, staff education, advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), telemedicine, and innovative sanitation methods. The future of hospital infection control may involve increased integration of environmental monitoring, antimicrobial stewardship, and patient participation while leveraging collaboration among healthcare facilities. The review highlights the criticality of hospital infection control and suggests trends and opportunities to strengthen prevention efforts and patient safety.25549828<SEP>R Hale<SEP>Working practices and success of infection prevention and control teams: a scoping study<SEP>Little research has been undertaken on how infection prevention and control (IPC) teams operate and how their effectiveness is assessed. This review aimed to explore how IPC teams embed IPC throughout hospitals, balance outbreak management with strategic aspects of IPC work (e.g. education), and how IPC team performance is measured. A scoping exercise was performed combining literature searches, evidence synthesis, and intelligence from expert advisers. Eleven publications were identified. One paper quantified how IPC nurses spend their time, two described daily activities of IPC teams, five described initiatives to embed IPC across organizations following legislation since 1999 in the UK or changes in the delivery of healthcare, and three explored the contribution of IPC intermediaries (link nurses and champions). Eight publications reported research findings. The others reported how IPC teams are embedding IPC practice in UK hospitals. In conclusion, there is scope for research to explore different models of IPC team-working and effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Other topics that need addressing are the willingness and ability of ward staff to assume increased responsibility for IPC and the effectiveness of intermediaries.37660712<SEP>Alex Howard<SEP>Antimicrobial treatment imprecision: an outcome-based model to close the data-to-action loop<SEP>Health-care systems, food supply chains, and society in general are threatened by the inexorable rise of antimicrobial resistance. This threat is driven by many factors, one of which is inappropriate antimicrobial treatment. The ability of policy makers and leaders in health care, public health, regulatory agencies, and research and development to deliver frameworks for appropriate, sustainable antimicrobial treatment is hampered by a scarcity of tangible outcome-based measures of the damage it causes. In this Personal View, a mathematically grounded, outcome-based measure of antimicrobial treatment appropriateness, called imprecision, is proposed. We outline a framework for policy makers and health-care leaders to use this metric to deliver more effective antimicrobial stewardship interventions to future patient pathways. This will be achieved using learning antimicrobial systems built on public and practitioner engagement; solid implementation science; advances in artificial intelligence; and changes to regulation, research, and development. The outcomes of this framework would be more ecologically and organisationally sustainable patterns of antimicrobial development, regulation, and prescribing. We discuss practical, ethical, and regulatory considerations involved in the delivery of novel antimicrobial drug development, and policy and patient pathways built on artificial intelligence-augmented measures of antimicrobial treatment imprecision.",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided in the context, it is important to understand that antibiotic prophylaxis plays a critical role in preventing surgical site infections (SSI) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The review of evidence indicated that proper antibiotic prophylaxis education and adherence can lead to a reduction in SSI incidents. In the context of hospital infection control, strategies such as hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, and surveillance are key components in preventing healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs). However, challenges such as resistance to change and resource limitations persist.\n\nWhen considering antibiotic usage for viral infections specifically, it is important to note that antibiotics are not effective against viruses. Antibiotics are designed to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, not viruses. Viral infections are usually managed through antiviral medications, supportive care, and preventive measures like vaccines.\n\nTherefore, in the context of the question \"Is antibiotic usage necessary for viral infections?\" it is crucial to emphasize that antibiotics are not necessary for treating viral infections. Inappropriate antibiotic use for viral infections can lead to antibiotic resistance, which poses a significant threat to public health. It is important to use antibiotics judiciously and follow proper guidelines to address specific types of infections effectively.",

    "context": "37919737<SEP>Ritu Chauhan<SEP>The impact of geo-political socio-economic factors on vaccine dissemination trends: a case-study on COVID-19 vaccination strategies<SEP>Background: The world in recent years has seen a pandemic of global scale. To counter the widespread loss of life and severe repercussions, researchers developed vaccinations at a fast pace to immunize the population. While the vaccines were developed and tested through extensive human trials, historically vaccines have been known to evoke mixed sentiments among the generic demographics. In the proposed study, we aim to reveal the impact of political and socio-economic factors on SARS-Cov-2 vaccination trends observed in two hundred and seventeen countries spread across the six continents. Methods: The study had hypothesized that the citizens who have lower trust in their government would be less inclined towards vaccination programs. To test this hypothesis, vaccination trends of nations under authoritarian rule were compared against democratic nations. Further, the study was synthesized with Cov-2 vaccination data which was sourced from Our World Data repository, which was sampled among 217 countries spread across the 6 continents. The study was analyzed with exploratory data analysis and proposed with relevance and impacting factor that was considered for vaccine dissemination in comparison with the literacy rate of the nations. Another impacting factor the study focused on for the vaccination dissemination trends was the health expenses of different nations. The study has been synthesized on political and socio-economic factors where the features were ardently study in retrospect of varied socio- economic features which may include country wise literacy rate, overall GDP rate, further we substantiated the work to address the political factors which are discussed as the country status of democratic or having other status. Results: The comparison of trends showed that dissemination of SARS-Cov-2 vaccines had been comparable between the two-opposing types of governance. The major impact factor behind the wide acceptance of the SARS-Cov-2 vaccine was the expenditure done by a country on healthcare. These nations used a large number of vaccines to administer to their population and the trends showed positive growth. The overall percentage of vaccine utilized by countries in quantitative terms are Pfizer/BioNTech (17.55%), Sputnik V (7.08%), Sinovac (6.98%), Sinopharm/Beijing (10.04%), Oxford/AstraZeneca (19.56%), CanSino (2.85%), Moderna (12.05%), Covaxin (3.28%), JohnsonandJohnson (10.89%), Sputnik Light (3.07%), Novavax (3.49%). While the nations with the lowest healthcare expenses failed to keep up with the demand and depended on vaccines donated by other countries to protect their population. Conclusions: The analysis revealed strong indicators that the nations which spend more on healthcare were the ones that had the best SARS-Cov-2 vaccination rollout. To further support decision-making in the future, countries should address the trust and sentiment of their citizens towards vaccination. For this, expenses need to be made to develop and promote vaccines and project them as positive health tools.34580088<SEP>Lukasz S Wylezinski<SEP>Influence of social determinants of health and county vaccination rates on machine learning models to predict COVID-19 case growth in Tennessee<SEP>Introduction: The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has exposed health disparities throughout the USA, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. As a result, there is a need for data-driven approaches to pinpoint the unique constellation of clinical and social determinants of health (SDOH) risk factors that give rise to poor patient outcomes following infection in US communities. Methods: We combined county-level COVID-19 testing data, COVID-19 vaccination rates and SDOH information in Tennessee. Between February and May 2021, we trained machine learning models on a semimonthly basis using these datasets to predict COVID-19 incidence in Tennessee counties. We then analyzed SDOH data features at each time point to rank the impact of each feature on model performance. Results: Our results indicate that COVID-19 vaccination rates play a crucial role in determining future COVID-19 disease risk. Beginning in mid-March 2021, higher vaccination rates significantly correlated with lower COVID-19 case growth predictions. Further, as the relative importance of COVID-19 vaccination data features grew, demographic SDOH features such as age, race and ethnicity decreased while the impact of socioeconomic and environmental factors, including access to healthcare and transportation, increased. Conclusion: Incorporating a data framework to track the evolving patterns of community-level SDOH risk factors could provide policy-makers with additional data resources to improve health equity and resilience to future public health emergencies.28815488<SEP>Kaisu Koski<SEP>Exploring Vaccine Hesitancy Through an Artist-Scientist Collaboration : Visualizing Vaccine-Critical Parents' Health Beliefs<SEP>This project explores vaccine hesitancy through an artist-scientist collaboration. It aims to create better understanding of vaccine hesitant parents' health beliefs and how these influence their vaccine-critical decisions. The project interviews vaccine-hesitant parents in the Netherlands and Finland and develops experimental visual-narrative means to analyse the interview data. Vaccine-hesitant parents' health beliefs are, in this study, expressed through stories, and they are paralleled with so-called illness narratives. The study explores the following four main health beliefs originating from the parents' interviews: (1) perceived benefits of illness, (2) belief in the body's intelligence and self-healing capacity, (3) beliefs about the \"inside-outside\" flow of substances in the body, and (4) view of death as a natural part of life. These beliefs are interpreted through arts-based diagrammatic representations. These diagrams, merging multiple aspects of the parents' narratives, are subsequently used in a collaborative meaning-making dialogue between the artist and the scientist. The resulting dialogue contrasts the health beliefs behind vaccine hesitancy with scientific knowledge, as well as the authors' personal, and differing, attitudes toward these.35459950<SEP>Ross D Booton<SEP>Modelling the effect of COVID-19 mass vaccination on acute hospital admissions<SEP>Background: Managing high levels of acute COVID-19 bed occupancy can affect the quality of care provided to both affected patients and those requiring other hospital services. Mass vaccination has offered a route to reduce societal restrictions while protecting hospitals from being overwhelmed. Yet, early in the mass vaccination effort, the possible impact on future bed pressures remained subject to considerable uncertainty. Objective: The aim of this study was to model the effect of vaccination on projections of acute and intensive care bed demand within a 1 million resident healthcare system located in South West England. Methods: An age-structured epidemiological model of the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered type was fitted to local data up to the time of the study, in early March 2021. Model parameters and vaccination scenarios were calibrated through a system-wide multidisciplinary working group, comprising public health intelligence specialists, healthcare planners, epidemiologists and academics. Scenarios assumed incremental relaxations to societal restrictions according to the envisaged UK Government timeline, with all restrictions to be removed by 21 June 2021. Results: Achieving 95% vaccine uptake in adults by 31 July 2021 would not avert the third wave in autumn 2021 but would produce a median peak bed requirement \u223c6% (IQR: 1-24%) of that experienced during the second wave (January 2021). A 2-month delay in vaccine rollout would lead to significantly higher peak bed occupancy, at 66% (11-146%) of that of the second wave. If only 75% uptake was achieved (the amount typically associated with vaccination campaigns), then the second wave peak for acute and intensive care beds would be exceeded by 4% and 19%, respectively, an amount which would seriously pressure hospital capacity. Conclusion: Modelling influenced decision-making among senior managers in setting COVID-19 bed capacity levels, as well as highlighting the importance of public health in promoting high vaccine uptake among the population. Forecast accuracy has since been supported by actual data collected following the analysis, with observed peak bed occupancy falling comfortably within the inter-quartile range of modelled projections.",
    "answer": "Yes, vaccines aid in preventing specific infectious diseases. The context provided highlights various studies and research focusing on COVID-19 vaccination strategies and the impact of vaccination rates on disease outcomes. Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has shown positive results in reducing COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, especially when higher vaccination rates are achieved. Studies have shown that countries with higher healthcare expenditure and vaccination rates have better vaccination rollout and lower disease incidence. Therefore, vaccines play a crucial role in preventing infectious diseases and reducing their impact on populations.",

Methods: We analyzed claims data from OptumLabs\u00ae Data Warehouse for 119,952 adults newly diagnosed diabetes between 2005 and 2018. We applied a novel Mixed Effects Machine Learning model to identify longitudinal trajectories of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) over 3 years of follow-up and used multinomial regression to characterize factors associated with each trajectory. Results: The study population was comprised of 119,952 adults with newly diagnosed diabetes, including 696 (0.58%) with type 1 diabetes. Among patients with type 1 diabetes, 52.6% were diagnosed at very high HbA1c, partially improved, but never achieved control; 32.5% were diagnosed at low HbA1c and deteriorated over time; and 14.9% had stable low HbA1c. Among patients with type 2 diabetes, 67.7% had stable low HbA1c, 14.4% were diagnosed at very high HbA1c, partially improved, but never achieved control; 10.0% were diagnosed at moderately high HbA1c and deteriorated over time; and 4.9% were diagnosed at moderately high HbA1c and improved over time. Conclusions: Claims data identified distinct longitudinal trajectories of HbA1c after diabetes diagnosis, which can be used to anticipate challenges and individualize care plans to improve glycemic control.24006023<SEP>Baltica Cabieses<SEP>Changing patterns of migration in Latin America: how can research develop intelligence for public health?<SEP>Migration patterns in Latin America have changed significantly in recent decades, particularly since the onset of global recession in 2007. These recent economic changes have highlighted and exacerbated the weakness of evidence from Latin America regarding migration-a crucial determinant of health. Migration patterns are constantly evolving in Latin America, but research on migration has not developed at the same speed. This article focuses on the need for better understanding of the living conditions and health of migrant populations in Latin America within the context of the recent global recession. The authors explain how new data on migrant well-being could be obtained through improved evidence from censuses and ongoing research surveys to 1) better inform policy-makers about the needs of migrant populations in Latin America and 2) help determine better ways of reaching undocumented immigrants. Longitudinal studies on immigrants in Latin America are essential for generating a better representation of migrant living conditions and health needs during the initial stages of immigration and over time. To help meet this need, the authors support the promotion of sustainable sources of data and evidence on the complex relationship between migration and health.32006145<SEP>Jeremy DeJournett<SEP>Performance of a closed-loop glucose control system, comprising a continuous glucose monitoring system and an AI-based controller in swine during severe hypo- and hyperglycemic provocations<SEP>Intensive care unit (ICU) patients develop stress induced insulin resistance causing hyperglycemia, large glucose variability and hypoglycemia. These glucose metrics have all been associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. The only way to achieve safe glucose control at a lower glucose range (e.g., 4.4-6.6 mmol/L) will be through use of an autonomous closed loop glucose control system (artificial pancreas). Our goal with the present study was to assess the safety and performance of an artificial pancreas system, composed of the EIRUS (Maquet Critical Care AB) continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and novel artificial intelligence-based glucose control software, in a swine model using unannounced hypo- and hyperglycemia challenges. Fourteen piglets (6 control, 8 treated) underwent sequential unannounced hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic challenges with 3 IU of NovoRapid and a glucose infusion at 17 mg/kg/min over the course of 5 h. In the Control animals an experienced ICU physician used every 30-min blood glucose values to maintain control to a range of 4.4-9 mmol/L. In the Treated group the artificial pancreas system attempted to maintain blood glucose control to a range of 4.4-6.6 mmol/L. Five of six Control animals and none of eight Treated animals experienced severe hypoglycemia (< 2.22 mmol/L). The area under the curve 3.5 mmol/L was 28.9 (21.1-54.2) for Control and 4.8 (3.1-5.2) for the Treated animals. The total percent time within tight glucose control range, 4.4-6.6 mmol/L, was 32.8% (32.4-47.1) for Controls and 55.4% (52.9-59.4) for Treated (p < 0.034). Data are median and quartiles. The artificial pancreas system abolished severe hypoglycemia and outperformed the experienced ICU physician in avoiding clinically significant hypoglycemic excursions.35996111<SEP>Enrico Longato<SEP>Time-resolved trajectory of glucose lowering medications and cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes: a recurrent neural network analysis<SEP>Aim: Treatment algorithms define lines of glucose lowering medications (GLM) for the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but whether therapeutic trajectories are associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) is unclear. We explored whether the temporal resolution of GLM usage discriminates patients who experienced a 4P-MACE (heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, death for all causes). Methods: We used an administrative database (Veneto region, North-East Italy, 2011-2018) and implemented recurrent neural networks (RNN) with outcome-specific attention maps. The model input included age, sex, diabetes duration, and a matrix of GLM pattern before the 4P-MACE or censoring. Model output was discrimination, reported as area under receiver characteristic curve (AUROC). Attention maps were produced to show medications whose time-resolved trajectories were the most important for discrimination. Results: The analysis was conducted on 147,135 patients for training and model selection and on 10,000 patients for validation. Collected data spanned a period of ~ 6 years. The RNN model efficiently discriminated temporal patterns of GLM ending in a 4P-MACE vs. those ending in an event-free censoring with an AUROC of 0.911 (95% C.I. 0.904-0.919). This excellent performance was significantly better than that of other models not incorporating time-resolved GLM trajectories: (i) a logistic regression on the bag-of-words encoding all GLM ever taken by the patient (AUROC 0.754; 95% C.I. 0.743-0.765); (ii) a model including the sequence of GLM without temporal relationships (AUROC 0.749; 95% C.I. 0.737-0.761); (iii) a RNN model with the same construction rules but including a time-inverted or randomised order of GLM. Attention maps identified the time-resolved pattern of most common first-line (metformin), second-line (sulphonylureas) GLM, and insulin (glargine) as those determining discrimination capacity. Conclusions: The time-resolved pattern of GLM use identified patients with subsequent cardiovascular events better than the mere list or sequence of prescribed GLM. Thus, a patient's therapeutic trajectory could determine disease outcomes.",
    "answer": "Early indicators of diabetes can include high levels of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). In a study analyzing claims data from 119,952 adults newly diagnosed with diabetes, it was found that patients with type 1 diabetes were often diagnosed with very high HbA1c levels and struggled to achieve control. On the other hand, patients with type 2 diabetes showed varying trajectories, with some having stable low HbA1c levels and others deteriorating over time. Additionally, patients with type 2 diabetes who were initially diagnosed at very high HbA1c levels but partially improved without achieving control were also identified as a group.\n\nThese findings suggest that monitoring HbA1c levels can serve as an early indicator of diabetes and may help anticipate challenges in achieving glycemic control. By identifying these longitudinal trajectories of HbA1c after diabetes diagnosis, healthcare providers can personalize care plans to improve management of the disease.",

Hemodynamic gain index (HGI) is a recent sensitive indicator of ischemia and has been associated with increased mortality. This study evaluated the clinical impact of HGI in patients who underwent concomitant exercise stress testing and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Methods: A total of 284 consecutive patients from the executive health program between 2010 and 2018 were identified. Resting and peak heart rate (HR) as well as systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements were recorded. Framingham risk score (FRS), Duke treadmill score (DTS) and HGI [Formula: see text] were calculated. The latter was divided into quartiles. CCTA was used as a reference test to detect any CAD. Multivariate analysis and artificial neural network were used to determine the independent predictors of obstructive CAD. Results: Mean age was 53 \u00b1 12 years with 83% male. Mean HGI was 1.74 \u00b1 0.67, with cut-off value of severely blunted HGI \u2264 1.25 (Quartile 4). Patients with severely blunted HGI were older, had higher FRS, and worse DTS. Patients with obstructive CAD had lower HGI when compared to those with normal CCTA/non-obstructive CAD (1.36 \u00b1 0.53 vs. 1.77 \u00b1 0.67, P = 0.005), and showed a higher prevalence of severely blunted HGI (44% vs. 22%, P = 0.019). After adjusting for traditional risk factors, HGI remained an independent predictor of obstructive CAD while severely blunted HGI was associated with threefold increased odds of having obstructive CAD (P = 0.05). Using artificial intelligence analysis, severely blunted HGI independently predicted obstructive CAD with an area under the curve of 0.83 and 0.96, and normalized importance of HGI of 100% and 63%, respectively for different models. Conclusions: Among patients who underwent concomitant exercise stress testing and CCTA, severely blunted HGI independently predicted obstructive CAD after multivariate adjustment for traditional risk factors.36371659<SEP>Christian Hamilton-Craig<SEP>Stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging: a guide for the general cardiologist<SEP>Stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is an emerging non-invasive imaging technique for the assessment of known or suspected ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Stress CMR provides information on myocardial perfusion, wall motion, ventricular dimensions and volumes, as well as late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) scar imaging in a single test without ionising radiation. Data from numerous multicentre randomised studies show high diagnostic and prognostic utility, its efficacy as a gatekeeper to invasive coronary angiography and use for guiding coronary revascularisation decisions. Stress CMR is cost-effective across multiple healthcare settings, yet its uptake and usage varies worldwide and is an underutilised technology. New developments include rapid acquisition protocols, automated quantification of perfusion and myocardial blood flow, and artificial intelligence-aided automated analysis and reporting. Stress CMR is becoming more accessible and standardised around the globe and is ready for 'prime time' use in the non-invasive assessment of patients with suspected IHD.33631889<SEP>S H Cheng<SEP>[The role of Artificial intelligent-based FFRCT in assessing the hemodynamic relevance of deep myocardial bridge of the left anterior descending coronary artery]<SEP>Objective: To investigate the role of artificial intelligence-based coronary CT blood flow reserve score (FFRCT) in assessing hemodynamic relevance in patients with deep myocardial bridge (MB) of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Methods: A total of 113 patients diagnosed with deep MB of the left anterior descending coronary artery by coronary CT angiography (CCTA) at the Department of Radiology of Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji University from January 2017 to December 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The location, length, depth, and degree of systolic compression of the MB were measured. The artificial intelligence-based coronary FFRCT software was employed to calculate the FFRCT value of the deep MB of the left anterior descending coronary artery. With the boundary of 0.80, all patients were divided into FFRCT normal group (FFRCT>0.80) and FFRCT abnormal group (FFRCT\u22640.80), and the relationship between FFRCT abnormality and the location, length, depth, and degree of systolic stenosis of the deep MB of the left anterior descending branch was analyzed. The effectiveness of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in predicting FFRCT abnormalities was measured by using ROC curve to analyze the length, depth, and degree of systolic stenosis of MB. Results: There were no significant differences in age, gender and high-risk factors between FFRCT normal group (n=79) and FFRCT abnormal group (n=34) (P>0.05). In terms of clinical symptoms, unstable angina, asymptomatic myocardial ischemia, stable angina in the FFRCT normal group were 15.2%, 41.8%, 32.9%,respectively, while 32.4%, 23.5%, 35.3% in the FFRCT abnormal group,respectively. Except for unstable angina (\u03c7\u00b2=4.32,P=0.038), there were no significant differences in asymptomatic myocardial ischemia and stable angina between the two groups (\u03c7\u00b2=3.42, 0.06, P>0.05). The length of deep MB was about (36\u00b15) mm in the FFRCT normal group and (44\u00b15) mm in the FFRCT abnormal group, respectively. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant (t=-7.703, P<0.001). The ROC curve showed that the optimal critical value of the length of the deep MB was 39.7 mm, the area under the curve was 0.88 (95%CI:0.81-0.95, P<0.001), and the accuracy rate of diagnosing FFRCT \u22640.80 was 82.3%. Conclusion: FFRCT value is of great value in the evaluation of hemodynamics in patients with deep myocardial bridge of left anterior descending coronary artery, and the length of deep myocardial bridge is an important factor affecting FFRCT value.35928935<SEP>Juntae Kim<SEP>Machine learning models of clinically relevant biomarkers for the prediction of stable obstructive coronary artery disease<SEP>Background: In patients with suspected obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), evaluation using a pre-test probability model is the key element for diagnosis; however, its accuracy is controversial. This study aimed to develop machine learning (ML) models using clinically relevant biomarkers to predict the presence of stable obstructive CAD and to compare ML models with an established pre-test probability of CAD models. Methods: Eight machine learning models for prediction of obstructive CAD were trained on a cohort of 1,312 patients [randomly split into the training (80%) and internal validation sets (20%)]. Twelve clinical and blood biomarker features assessed on admission were used to inform the models. We compared the best-performing ML model and established the pre-test probability of CAD (updated Diamond-Forrester and CAD consortium) models. Results: The CatBoost algorithm model showed the best performance (area under the receiver operating characteristics, AUROC, 0.796, and 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.740-0.853; Matthews correlation coefficient, MCC, 0.448) compared to the seven other algorithms. The CatBoost algorithm model improved risk prediction compared with the CAD consortium clinical model (AUROC 0.727; 95% CI 0.664-0.789; MCC 0.313). The accuracy of the ML model was 74.6%. Age, sex, hypertension, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T, hemoglobin A1c, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels contributed most to obstructive CAD prediction. Conclusion: The ML models using clinically relevant biomarkers provided high accuracy for stable obstructive CAD prediction. In real-world practice, employing such an approach could improve discrimination of patients with suspected obstructive CAD and help select appropriate non-invasive testing for ischemia.",

Insights into economic and clinical aspects<SEP>Asthma, an increasingly prevalent chronic respiratory condition, incurs significant economic costs worldwide. Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Machine Learning (ML), has been widely recognized as transformative when applied to asthma care. This commentary investigates how AI and ML may improve clinical outcomes while alleviating some of the costs associated with asthma care. AI's powerful analytical abilities could usher in an unprecedented era of preventive measures, particularly by identifying at-risk populations and anticipating environmental triggers. ML shows promise for enhancing real-time monitoring, early detection, and tailored treatment strategies in paediatric asthma, potentially reducing hospitalizations and emergency care costs. Emerging AI-powered wearable technologies are catalysing a revolutionary shift in patient monitoring, providing proactive interventions. Although optimistic, this commentary highlights a gap in empirical studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of AI in asthma care and stresses the need for larger datasets to accurately represent the economic benefits of AI solutions. Additionally, this paper emphasizes the ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and algorithmic bias, which are vital for the successful and equitable integration of AI into healthcare settings.

Artificial intelligence (AI), a topic of great consternation, can serve as the \"wheat thresher\" for health care delivery, empowering and freeing both patients and physicians by decreasing administrative burden and improving labor productivity. In this Viewpoint, we discuss three principal areas where AI poses an unprecedented opportunity to reduce cost, improve care, and markedly enhance the patient and physician experience: (1) automation of administrative process, (2) augmentation of clinical practice, and (3) automation of elements of clinical practice.34220314<SEP>Yinhe Feng<SEP>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Chronic Airway Diseases: Focus on Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease<SEP>Chronic airway diseases are characterized by airway inflammation, obstruction, and remodeling and show high prevalence, especially in developing countries. Among them, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) show the highest morbidity and socioeconomic burden worldwide. Although there are extensive guidelines for the prevention, early diagnosis, and rational treatment of these lifelong diseases, their value in precision medicine is very limited. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as effective methods for mining and integrating large-scale, heterogeneous medical data for clinical practice, and several AI and ML methods have recently been applied to asthma and COPD. However, very few methods have significantly contributed to clinical practice. Here, we review four aspects of AI and ML implementation in asthma and COPD to summarize existing knowledge and indicate future steps required for the safe and effective application of AI and ML tools by clinicians.35360424<SEP>Nithesh Naik<SEP>Legal and Ethical Consideration in Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Who Takes Responsibility?<SEP>The legal and ethical issues that confront society due to Artificial Intelligence (AI) include privacy and surveillance, bias or discrimination, and potentially the philosophical challenge is the role of human judgment. Concerns about newer digital technologies becoming a new source of inaccuracy and data breaches have arisen as a result of its use. Mistakes in the procedure or protocol in the field of healthcare can have devastating consequences for the patient who is the victim of the error. Because patients come into contact with physicians at moments in their lives when they are most vulnerable, it is crucial to remember this. Currently, there are no well-defined regulations in place to address the legal and ethical issues that may arise due to the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare settings. This review attempts to address these pertinent issues highlighting the need for algorithmic transparency, privacy, and protection of all the beneficiaries involved and cybersecurity of associated vulnerabilities.",
    "answer": "Seeking medical assistance for asthma is advisable in several situations, including:\n\n1. **Severe Symptoms:** If a person with asthma experiences severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing, or coughing that does not improve with their usual medications.\n   \n2. **Frequent Attacks:** If the frequency of asthma attacks increases, it may indicate the need for a change in treatment or management plan.\n   \n3. **Trouble Managing Symptoms:** If someone is having difficulty managing their asthma symptoms despite following their treatment plan, it is important to seek medical advice.\n   \n4. **Emergency Situations:** In cases of an asthma emergency, where the person's breathing is severely compromised, medical assistance should be sought immediately.\n   \n5. **Assessment of Treatment Effectiveness:** Regular follow-ups with a healthcare provider are recommended to assess the effectiveness of the current treatment plan and make any necessary adjustments.\n\nOverall, it is important to work closely with a healthcare provider to develop a personalized asthma management plan and seek medical assistance when symptoms are not well controlled or in case of emergency.",

    "context": "34164283<SEP>Annemiek Snoeckx<SEP>The radiologist's role in lung cancer screening<SEP>Lung cancer is still the deadliest cancer in men and women worldwide. This high mortality is related to diagnosis in advanced stages, when curative treatment is no longer an option. Large randomized controlled trials have shown that lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (CT) can detect lung cancers at earlier stages and reduce lung cancer-specific mortality. The recent publication of the significant reduction of cancer-related mortality by 26% in the Dutch-Belgian NELSON LCS trial has increased the likelihood that implementation of LCS in Europe will move forward. Radiologists are important stakeholders in numerous aspects of the LCS pathway. Their role goes beyond nodule detection and nodule management. Being part of a multidisciplinary team, radiologists are key players in numerous aspects of implementation of a high quality LCS program. In this non-systematic review we discuss the multifaceted role of radiologists in LCS.30419237<SEP>Dean E Schraufnagel<SEP>Air Pollution and Noncommunicable Diseases: A Review by the Forum of International Respiratory Societies' Environmental Committee, Part 2: Air Pollution and Organ Systems<SEP>Although air pollution is well known to be harmful to the lung and airways, it can also damage most other organ systems of the body. It is estimated that about 500,000 lung cancer deaths and 1.6 million COPD deaths can be attributed to air pollution, but air pollution may also account for 19% of all cardiovascular deaths and 21% of all stroke deaths. Air pollution has been linked to other malignancies, such as bladder cancer and childhood leukemia. Lung development in childhood is stymied with exposure to air pollutants, and poor lung development in children predicts lung impairment in adults. Air pollution is associated with reduced cognitive function and increased risk of dementia. Particulate matter in the air (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 \u03bcm) is associated with delayed psychomotor development and lower child intelligence. Studies link air pollution with diabetes mellitus prevalence, morbidity, and mortality. Pollution affects the immune system and is associated with allergic rhinitis, allergic sensitization, and autoimmunity. It is also associated with osteoporosis and bone fractures, conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, blepharitis, inflammatory bowel disease, increased intravascular coagulation, and decreased glomerular filtration rate. Atopic and urticarial skin disease, acne, and skin aging are linked to air pollution. Air pollution is controllable and, therefore, many of these adverse health effects can be prevented.35535966<SEP>Caichen Li<SEP>Advances in lung cancer screening and early detection<SEP>Lung cancer is associated with a heavy cancer-related burden in terms of patients' physical and mental health worldwide. Two randomized controlled trials, the US-National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek (NELSON), indicated that low-dose CT (LDCT) screening results in a statistically significant decrease in mortality in patients with lung cancer, LDCT has become the standard approach for lung cancer screening. However, many issues in lung cancer screening remain unresolved, such as the screening criteria, high false-positive rate, and radiation exposure. This review first summarizes recent studies on lung cancer screening from the US, Europe, and Asia, and discusses risk-based selection for screening and the related issues. Second, an overview of novel techniques for the differential diagnosis of pulmonary nodules, including artificial intelligence and molecular biomarker-based screening, is presented. Third, current explorations of strategies for suspected malignancy are summarized. Overall, this review aims to help clinicians understand recent progress in lung cancer screening and alleviate the burden of lung cancer.34164285<SEP>Anton Schreuder<SEP>Artificial intelligence for detection and characterization of pulmonary nodules in lung cancer CT screening: ready for practice?<SEP>Lung cancer computed tomography (CT) screening trials using low-dose CT have repeatedly demonstrated a reduction in the number of lung cancer deaths in the screening group compared to a control group. With various countries currently considering the implementation of lung cancer screening, recurring discussion points are, among others, the potentially high false positive rates, cost-effectiveness, and the availability of radiologists for scan interpretation. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to increase the efficiency of lung cancer screening. We discuss the performance levels of AI algorithms for various tasks related to the interpretation of lung screening CT scans, how they compare to human experts, and how AI and humans may complement each other. We discuss how AI may be used in the lung cancer CT screening workflow according to the current evidence and describe the additional research that will be required before AI can take a more prominent role in the analysis of lung screening CT scans.",
    "answer": "The risk of developing lung cancer can vary based on multiple factors. Some of the key factors that can increase the risk of developing lung cancer include:\n\n1. Smoking: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer. Smokers are at a much higher risk of developing lung cancer compared to non-smokers. The risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the duration of smoking.\n\n2. Exposure to secondhand smoke: Being exposed to secondhand smoke can also increase the risk of developing lung cancer, especially for non-smokers who are regularly exposed to smoke in their environment.\n\n3. Environmental factors: Exposure to certain environmental pollutants, such as air pollution, asbestos, radon, and other carcinogens, can increase the risk of developing lung cancer.\n\n4. Family history: Having a family history of lung cancer can also increase the risk of developing the disease. Genetic factors may play a role in increasing susceptibility to lung cancer.\n\n5. Age and gender: The risk of developing lung cancer increases with age, with the majority of cases diagnosed in individuals over the age of 65. Men are also at a higher risk of developing lung cancer compared to women.\n\n6. Prior history of lung disease: Individuals with a history of certain lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or pulmonary fibrosis, may have an increased risk of developing lung cancer.\n\nIt is important to note that while these factors can increase the risk of developing lung cancer, not everyone with these risk factors will develop the disease. It is essential to discuss individual risk factors with healthcare providers and undergo appropriate screening tests, such as low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening, for early detection and prevention of lung cancer.",

    "question": "Where can resources for healthy dietary plans be found?",
    "context": "30544190<SEP>Angeline Chatelan<SEP>Precision nutrition: hype or hope for public health interventions to reduce obesity?<SEP>High-income countries are experiencing an obesity epidemic that follows a socioeconomic gradient, affecting groups of lower socioeconomic status disproportionately. Recent clinical findings have suggested new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of obesity, using personalized dietary approaches. Precision nutrition (PN), also called personalized nutrition, has been developed to deliver more preventive and practical dietary advice than 'one-size-fits-all' guidelines. With interventions becoming increasingly plausible at a large scale thanks to artificial intelligence and smartphone applications, some have begun to view PN as a novel way to deliver the right dietary intervention to the right population. We argue that large-scale PN, if taken alone, might be of limited interest from a public health perspective. Building on Geoffrey Rose's theory regarding the differences in individual and population causes of disease, we show that large-scale PN can only address some individual causes of obesity (causes of cases). This individual-centred approach is likely to have a small impact on the distribution of obesity at a population level because it ignores the population causes of obesity (causes of incidence). The latter are embedded in the populations' social, cultural, economic and political contexts that make environments obesogenic. Additionally, the most socially privileged groups in the population are the most likely to respond to large-scale PN interventions. This could have the undesirable effect of widening social inequalities in obesity. We caution public health actors that interventions based only on large-scale PN are unlikely, despite current expectations, to improve dietary intake or reduce obesity at a population level.34008960<SEP>Juliane R Sempionatto<SEP>Wearable and Mobile Sensors for Personalized Nutrition<SEP>While wearable and mobile chemical sensors have experienced tremendous growth over the past decade, their potential for tracking and guiding nutrition has emerged only over the past three years. Currently, guidelines from doctors and dietitians represent the most common approach for maintaining optimal nutrition status. However, such recommendations rely on population averages and do not take into account individual variability in responding to nutrients. Precision nutrition has recently emerged to address the large heterogeneity in individuals' responses to diet, by tailoring nutrition based on the specific requirements of each person. It aims at preventing and managing diseases by formulating personalized dietary interventions to individuals on the basis of their metabolic profile, background, and environmental exposure. Recent advances in digital nutrition technology, including calories-counting mobile apps and wearable motion tracking devices, lack the ability of monitoring nutrition at the molecular level. The realization of effective precision nutrition requires synergy from different sensor modalities in order to make timely reliable predictions and efficient feedback. This work reviews key opportunities and challenges toward the successful realization of effective wearable and mobile nutrition monitoring platforms. Non-invasive wearable and mobile electrochemical sensors, capable of monitoring temporal chemical variations upon the intake of food and supplements, are excellent candidates to bridge the gap between digital and biochemical analyses for a successful personalized nutrition approach. By providing timely (previously unavailable) dietary information, such wearable and mobile sensors offer the guidance necessary for supporting dietary behavior change toward a managed nutritional balance. Coupling of the rapidly emerging wearable chemical sensing devices-generating enormous dynamic analytical data-with efficient data-fusion and data-mining methods that identify patterns and make predictions is expected to revolutionize dietary decision-making toward effective precision nutrition.33866251<SEP>Daniel Kirk<SEP>Precision nutrition: A systematic literature review<SEP>Precision Nutrition research aims to use personal information about individuals or groups of individuals to deliver nutritional advice that, theoretically, would be more suitable than generic advice. Machine learning, a subbranch of Artificial Intelligence, has promise to aid in the development of predictive models that are suitable for Precision Nutrition. As such, recent research has applied machine learning algorithms, tools, and techniques in precision nutrition for different purposes. However, a systematic overview of the state-of-the-art on the use of machine learning in Precision Nutrition is lacking. Therefore, we carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to provide an overview of where and how machine learning has been used in Precision Nutrition from various aspects, what such machine learning models use as input features, what the availability status of the data used in the literature is, and how the models are evaluated. Nine research questions were defined in this study. We retrieved 4930 papers from electronic databases and 60 primary studies were selected to respond to the research questions. All of the selected primary studies were also briefly discussed in this article. Our results show that fifteen problems spread across seven domains of nutrition and health are present. Four machine learning tasks are seen in the form of regression, classification, recommendation and clustering, with most of these utilizing a supervised approach. In total, 30 algorithms were used, with 19 appearing more than once. Models were through the use of four groups of approaches and 23 evaluation metrics. Personalized approaches are promising to reduce the burden of these current problems in nutrition research, and the current review shows Machine Learning can be incorporated into Precision Nutrition research with high performance. Precision Nutrition researchers should consider incorporating Machine Learning into their methods to facilitate the integration of many complex features, allowing for the development of high-performance Precision Nutrition approaches.35184443<SEP>Y Liu<SEP>[New definition of precision nutrition: concept and implementation]<SEP>The following 10 to 15 years will be a key strategic period for China to improve national nutrition and health.

    "context": "35595533<SEP>Satoshi Kidoguchi<SEP>Antihypertensive Drugs and Cancer Risk<SEP>Hypertension is the most prevalent comorbidity in cancer patients. Consequently, many cancer patients are prescribed antihypertensive drugs before cancer diagnosis or during cancer treatment. However, whether antihypertensive drugs affect the incidence, treatment efficacy, or prognosis of cancer remains unanswered. For instance, renin-angiotensin and \u03b2-adrenergic signaling may be involved not only in blood pressure elevation but also in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tissue invasion. Therefore, the inhibition of these pathways may have beneficial effects on cancer prevention or treatment. In this article, we reviewed several studies regarding antihypertensive drugs and cancer. In particular, we focused on the results of clinical trials to evaluate whether the use of antihypertensive drugs affects future cancer risk and prognosis. Unfortunately, the results are somewhat inconsistent, and evidence demonstrating the effect of antihypertensive drugs remains limited. We indicate that the heterogeneity in the study designs makes it difficult to clarify the causal relationship between antihypertensive drugs and cancer. We also propose that additional experimental studies, including research with induced pluripotent cells derived from cancer patients, single-cell analyses of cancer cell clusters, and clinical studies using artificial intelligence electronic health record systems, might be helpful to reveal the precise association between antihypertensive drugs and cancer risk.37565067<SEP>Benjamin Daniels<SEP>Prevalence of Australians exposed to potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicines: a population-based cohort study<SEP>Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer are leading causes of death and people with cancer are at higher risk of developing CVD than the general population. Many cancer medicines have cardiotoxic effects but the size of the population exposed to these potentially cardiotoxic medicines is not known. We aimed to determine the prevalence of exposure to potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicines in Australia. Methods: We identified potentially cardiotoxic systemic cancer medicines through searching the literature and registered product information documents. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Australians dispensed potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicines between 2005 and 2021, calculating age-standardised annual prevalence rates of people alive with exposure to a potentially cardiotoxic medicine during or prior to each year of the study period. Findings: We identified 108,175 people dispensed at least one potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicine; median age, 64 (IQR: 52-74); 57% female. Overall prevalence increased from 49 (95%CI: 48.7-49.3)/10,000 to 232 (95%CI: 231.4-232.6)/10,000 over the study period; 61 (95%CI: 60.5-61.5)/10,000 to 293 (95%CI: 292.1-293.9)/10,000 for females; and 39 (95%CI: 38.6-39.4)/10,000 to 169 (95%CI: 168.3-169.7)/10,000 for males. People alive five years following first exposure increased from 29 (95%CI: 28.8-29.2)/10,000 to 134 (95%CI: 133.6-134.4)/10,000; and from 22 (95%CI: 21.8-22.2)/10,000 to 76 (95%CI: 75.7-76.3)/10,000 for those alive at least 10 years following first exposure. Most people were exposed to only one potentially cardiotoxic medicine, rates of which increased from 39 (95%CI: 38.7-39.3)/10,000 in 2005 to 131 (95%CI: 130.6-131.4)/10,000 in 2021. Interpretation: The number of people exposed to efficacious yet potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicines in Australia is growing. Our findings can support the development of service planning and create awareness about the magnitude of cancer treatment-related cardiotoxicities.

Pharmacological treatment can inhibit the action of the mutant protein; however, drug resistance almost invariably emerges. Multiple studies revealed that cancer drug resistance is based upon a plethora of distinct mechanisms. Drug resistance mutations can occur in the same protein or in different proteins; as well as in the same pathway or in parallel pathways, bypassing the intercepted signaling. The dilemma that the clinical oncologist is facing is that not all the genomic alterations as well as alterations in the tumor microenvironment that facilitate cancer cell proliferation are known, and neither are the alterations that are likely to promote metastasis. For example, the common KRasG12C driver mutation emerges in different cancers. Most occur in NSCLC, but some occur, albeit to a lower extent, in colorectal cancer and pancreatic ductal carcinoma. The responses to KRasG12C inhibitors are variable and fall into three categories, (i) new point mutations in KRas, or multiple copies of KRAS G12C which lead to higher expression level of the mutant protein; (ii) mutations in genes other than KRAS; (iii) original cancer transitioning to other cancer(s). Resistance to adagrasib, an experimental antitumor agent exerting its cytotoxic effect as a covalent inhibitor of the G12C KRas, indicated that half of the cases present multiple KRas mutations as well as allele amplification. Redundant or parallel pathways included MET amplification; emerging driver mutations in NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1, and RET; gene fusion events in ALK, RET, BRAF, RAF1, and FGFR3; and loss-of-function mutations in NF1 and PTEN tumor suppressors. In the current review we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance while focusing on those emerging to common targeted cancer drivers. We also address questions of why cancers with a common driver mutation are unlikely to evolve a common drug resistance mechanism, and whether one can predict the likely mechanisms that the tumor cell may develop. These vastly important and tantalizing questions in drug discovery, and broadly in precision medicine, are the focus of our present review. We end with our perspective, which calls for target combinations to be selected and prioritized with the help of the emerging massive compute power which enables artificial intelligence, and the increased gathering of data to overcome its insatiable needs.31093860<SEP>Scott T Leatherdale<SEP>Artificial intelligence (AI) and cancer prevention: the potential application of AI in cancer control programming needs to be explored in population laboratories such as COMPASS<SEP>Understanding the risk factors that initiate cancer is essential for reducing the future cancer burden. Much of our current cancer control insight is from cohort studies and newer large-scale population laboratories designed to advance the science around precision oncology. Despite their promise for improving diagnosis and treatment outcomes, their current reductionist focus will likely have little impact shifting the cancer burden. However, it is possible that these big data assets can be adapted to have more impact on the future cancer burden through more focus on primary prevention efforts that incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). ML automatically learns patterns and can devise complex models and algorithms that lend themselves to prediction in big data, revealing new unexpected relationships and pathways in a reliable and replicable fashion that otherwise would remain hidden given the complexities of big data. While AI has made big strides in several domains, the potential application in cancer prevention is lacking. As such, this commentary suggests that it may be time to consider the potential of AI within our existing cancer control population laboratories, and provides justification for why some small targeted investments to explore their impact on modelling existing real-time cancer prevention data may be a strategic cancer control opportunity.",

Materials and methods: Data from two large cancer registries (registry A & B) the Northern and Yorkshire Cancer Registry Information Service (NYCRIS) and the West Midlands Cancer Intelligence Unit (WMCIU) from 1998-2003 for all cases of invasive breast cancer of either pure ductal or pure lobular reported histology were obtained. The invasive status of the contralateral tumour diagnosis and tumour morphology was collected. Chi-square tests were undertaken to examine the differences in contralateral rates for both registries and univariate analysis to ascertain which predictors affected contralateral breast cancer risk for registry A the WMCIU cases. Results: A total of 38,132 patients were studied, 32,735 patients with IDC and 5397 (14.2%) patients with ILC over the 6-year period. There was no significant difference between the occurrence and time to occurrence of contralateral breast cancer according to original cancer histology, 901 (2.8%) patients with IDC versus 166 (3.1%) patients with ILC (p=0.169). The analysis of registry A cases showed no association between original histology (ductal versus lobular), age at diagnosis, tumour grade, use of radiotherapy for the primary cancer or use of systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy), and development of a contralateral breast cancer. Conclusion: There is no apparent increase in risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer according to the primary cancer histology either IDC or ILC. Standard mammographic follow-up does not need to take account of original tumour pathology. Increased intervention or post-treatment surveillance for the contralateral breast is not indicated in the context of ILC. The role of MRI should be restricted to those patients with ILC who are planning breast-conservation surgery, but not for assessing the contralateral breast.34909264<SEP>Timothy E Hewett<SEP>The Use of Big Data to Improve Human Health: How Experience From other Industries Will Shape the Future<SEP>'Data science' represents a set of mathematical and software development related techniques that are applied across a wide range of problems and industries.

The concepts discussed can provide a starting point in which health and human performance-focused stakeholders can begin to align well-established data science applications from other domains to further enable innovative health and performance solutions.38416903<SEP>Rachel Miceli<SEP>Active Surveillance for Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia and Ductal Carcinoma In Situ<SEP>Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are relatively common breast lesions on the same spectrum of disease. Atypical ductal hyperblasia is a nonmalignant, high-risk lesion, and DCIS is a noninvasive malignancy. While a benefit of screening mammography is early cancer detection, it also leads to increased biopsy diagnosis of noninvasive lesions. Previously, treatment guidelines for both entities included surgical excision because of the risk of upgrade to invasive cancer after surgery and risk of progression to invasive cancer for DCIS. However, this universal management approach is not optimal for all patients because most lesions are not upgraded after surgery. Furthermore, some DCIS lesions do not progress to clinically significant invasive cancer. Overtreatment of high-risk lesions and DCIS is considered a burden on patients and clinicians and is a strain on the health care system. Extensive research has identified many potential histologic, clinical, and imaging factors that may predict ADH and DCIS upgrade and thereby help clinicians select which patients should undergo surgery and which may be appropriate for active surveillance (AS) with imaging. Additionally, multiple clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate whether AS for DCIS is feasible for a select group of patients. Recent advances in MRI, artificial intelligence, and molecular markers may also have an important role to play in stratifying patients and delineating best management guidelines. This review article discusses the available evidence regarding the feasibility and limitations of AS for ADH and DCIS, as well as recent advances in patient risk stratification.38149678<SEP>Rahaf M Ahmad<SEP>A review of genetic variant databases and machine learning tools for predicting the pathogenicity of breast cancer<SEP>Studies continue to uncover contributing risk factors for breast cancer (BC) development including genetic variants. Advances in machine learning and big data generated from genetic sequencing can now be used for predicting BC pathogenicity. However, it is unclear which tool developed for pathogenicity prediction is most suited for predicting the impact and pathogenicity of variant effects. A significant challenge is to determine the most suitable data source for each tool since different tools can yield different prediction results with different data inputs. To this end, this work reviews genetic variant databases and tools used specifically for the prediction of BC pathogenicity. We provide a description of existing genetic variants databases and, where appropriate, the diseases for which they have been established. Through example, we illustrate how they can be used for prediction of BC pathogenicity and discuss their associated advantages and disadvantages. We conclude that the tools that are specialized by training on multiple diverse datasets from different databases for the same disease have enhanced accuracy and specificity and are thereby more helpful to the clinicians in predicting and diagnosing BC as early as possible.",

Integrated care pathways that prescribe timeframes around access and interventions can potentially improve quality of care. Methods and analysis: A multicentre mixed methods study to assess feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness and analysis of direct costs of an integrated care pathway for psychosis. A pragmatic, non-randomised, controlled trial design is used to compare the impact of Treatment and Recovery In PsycHosis (TRIumPH; Intervention) by comparison between NHS organisations that adopt TRIumPH and those that continue with care as usual (Control). Quantitative and qualitative methods will be used. We will use routinely collected quantitative data and study-specific questionnaires and focus groups to compare service user outcomes, satisfaction and adherence to intervention between sites that adopt TRIumPH versus sites that continue with usual care pathways. Setting: 4 UK Mental health organisations. Two will implement TRIumPH whereas two will continue care as usual. Participants: Staff, carers, individuals accepted to early intervention in psychosis teams in participating organisations for the study period. Intervention: TRIumPH-Integrated Care Pathway for psychosis that has a holistic approach and prescribes time frames against interventions; developed using intelligence from data; co-produced with patients, carers, clinicians and other stakeholders. Outcomes: Feasibility will be assessed through adherence to the process measures. Satisfaction and acceptability will be assessed using questionnaires and focus groups. Effectiveness will be assessed through data collection and evaluation of patient outcomes, including clinical, functional and recovery outcomes, physical health, acute care use. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, 12 and 24 months to measure whether there is an effect and if so, whether this is sustained over time. Outcomes measures at the adopter sites will be compared to their own baseline and against comparator sites.

A systematic search of Pubmed, Embase, and PsycInfo (1980 through August 2014) was performed to identify longitudinal observational studies assessing correlates and/or predictors of clinical, functional, cognitive, and biological outcomes in EOP. Seventy-five studies were included in the review. Using multivariate models, the most replicated predictors of worse clinical, functional, cognitive, and biological outcomes in EOP were premorbid difficulties and symptom severity (especially of negative symptoms) at baseline. Longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) predicted worse clinical, functional, and cognitive outcomes. Higher risk of attempting suicide was predicted by greater severity of psychotic illness and of depressive symptoms at the first episode of psychosis. Age at onset and sex were not found to be relevant predictors of outcome in most multivariate models, whereas studies using bivariate analyses yielded inconsistent results. Lower intelligence quotient at baseline predicted lower insight at follow-up, worse functional outcomes, and a diagnostic outcome of schizophrenia. Biological predictors of outcome in EOP have been little studied and have not been replicated. Lower levels of antioxidants at baseline predicted greater brain volume changes and worse cognitive functioning at follow-up, whereas neuroimaging markers such as regional cortical thickness and gray matter volume at baseline predicted remission and better insight at follow-up, respectively. EOP patients with poorer premorbid adjustment and prominent negative symptoms at initial presentation are at risk of poor outcome. They should therefore be the target of careful monitoring and more intensive interventions to address whether the disease course can be modified in this especially severely affected group. Early intervention strategies to reduce DUP may also improve outcome in EOP.36773697<SEP>Carrie E Bearden<SEP>Editorial: New Clues Into Cortical Changes That Converge on Psychosis<SEP>Adults living with schizophrenia have prominent and widespread alterations in brain structure and function, but until recently little was known about the developmental timing and course of such changes. Prospective studies of individuals at elevated risk for developing psychosis, termed clinical high-risk (CHR) or psychosis risk syndrome patients, can address these questions, thus providing clues into neurobiological mechanisms that occur prior to illness onset. In this issue, Fortea et al.1 present the results of a prospective longitudinal brain imaging investigation of 107 adolescents at CHR for developing a psychotic disorder (23% of whom developed psychosis over the follow-up period) and 102 typically developing controls. Participants were scanned at baseline and at 18-month follow-up or at the time of conversion to psychosis. Using linear mixed-effects models to measure cortical surface area over time, the authors found that youth who developed a psychotic disorder during the follow-up period experienced greater loss of cortical surface area in bilateral parietal and right frontal regions compared to CHR youth who did not develop psychosis, and in left parietal and occipital regions compared to healthy controls. Findings were not accounted for by antipsychotic medication use, cannabis use, or general intelligence. Thus, these observations suggest that emerging psychosis may have an impact on typical neuromaturational changes that occur during adolescence.29378553<SEP>Sarah Denford<SEP>Improving public health evaluation: a qualitative investigation of practitioners' needs<SEP>Background: In 2011, the House of Lords published a report on Behaviour Change, in which they report that \"a lot more could, and should, be done to improve the evaluation of interventions.\" This study aimed to undertake a needs assessment of what kind of evaluation training and materials would be of most use to UK public health practitioners by conducting interviews with practitioners about everyday evaluation practice and needed guidance and materials. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 public health practitioners in two UK regions, Cambridgeshire and the South West. Participants included directors of public health, consultants in public health, health improvement advisors, public health intelligence, and public health research officers. A topic guide included questions designed to explore participants existing evaluation practice and their needs for further training and guidance. Data were analysed using thematic analyses. Results: Practitioners highlighted the need for evaluation to defend the effectiveness of existing programs and protect funding provisions. However, practitioners often lacked training in evaluation, and felt unqualified to perform such a task. The majority of practitioners did not use, or were not aware of many existing evaluation guidance documents. They wanted quality-assured, practical guidance that relate to the real world settings in which they operate. Practitioners also mentioned the need for better links and support from academics in public health. Conclusion: Whilst numerous guidance documents supporting public health evaluation exist, these documents are currently underused by practitioners - either because they are not considered useful, or because practitioners are not aware of them. Integrating existing guides into a catalogue of guidance documents, and developing a new-quality assured, practical and useful document may support the evaluation of public health programs. This in turn has the potential to identify those programs that are effective; thus improving public health and reducing financial waste.",
    "answer": "In the context provided, the initiation of medication for mental health disorders, specifically psychosis, is crucial in improving outcomes for individuals. The duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), which is the time between the onset of symptoms and the start of treatment, is considered a strong predictor of symptom severity and overall outcome. Initiating medication early in the course of psychosis can help manage symptoms, improve functioning, and reduce the risk of adverse outcomes.\n\nEarly intervention strategies to reduce DUP have been shown to improve outcomes in early-onset psychosis (EOP) patients. Studies have found that longer DUP predicts worse clinical, functional, and cognitive outcomes in EOP. Therefore, it is important to initiate medication and interventions as soon as possible after symptom onset to prevent further deterioration and improve overall prognosis.\n\nOverall, the timely initiation of medication and interventions for mental health disorders, particularly psychosis, is essential in promoting recovery, managing symptoms, and improving long-term outcomes for individuals. Initiating treatment early, as part of an integrated care pathway, can lead to better adherence, satisfaction, and effectiveness of interventions, ultimately improving the quality of care and outcomes for individuals experiencing mental health disorders.",

    "question": "Who should be consulted prior to antibiotic administration?",
    "context": "34654462<SEP>Marin H Kollef<SEP>Timing of antibiotic therapy in the ICU<SEP>Severe or life threatening infections are common among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most infections in the ICU are bacterial or fungal in origin and require antimicrobial therapy for clinical resolution. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of therapy for infected critically ill patients. However, antibiotics are often not optimally administered resulting in less favorable patient outcomes including greater mortality. The timing of antibiotics in patients with life threatening infections including sepsis and septic shock is now recognized as one of the most important determinants of survival for this population. Individuals who have a delay in the administration of antibiotic therapy for serious infections can have a doubling or more in their mortality. Additionally, the timing of an appropriate antibiotic regimen, one that is active against the offending pathogens based on in vitro susceptibility, also influences survival. Thus not only is early empiric antibiotic administration important but the selection of those agents is crucial as well. The duration of antibiotic infusions, especially for \u03b2-lactams, can also influence antibiotic efficacy by increasing antimicrobial drug exposure for the offending pathogen. However, due to mounting antibiotic resistance, aggressive antimicrobial de-escalation based on microbiology results is necessary to counterbalance the pressures of early broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In this review, we examine time related variables impacting antibiotic optimization as it relates to the treatment of life threatening infections in the ICU. In addition to highlighting the importance of antibiotic timing in the ICU we hope to provide an approach to antimicrobials that also minimizes the unnecessary use of these agents. Such approaches will increasingly be linked to advances in molecular microbiology testing and artificial intelligence/machine learning. Such advances should help identify patients needing empiric antibiotic therapy at an earlier time point as well as the specific antibiotics required in order to avoid unnecessary administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.38259418<SEP>Dimple Kubde<SEP>Importance of Hospital Infection Control<SEP>The increasing demand for healthcare-acquired infection (HAI) control practices and services has intensified the need to evaluate care quality. The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced an infection prevention and control (IPC) framework to mitigate the impact of HAIs, crucial for ensuring patient safety in hospitals. HAIs acquired after hospitalization pose significant challenges due to factors such as compromised immunity, invasive medical procedures, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which have dire consequences, including higher mortality rates and increased healthcare costs. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are critical in implementing IPC measures. Infection control programs that include strategies such as hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE), environmental cleaning, and surveillance have become standard. However, challenges such as resistance to change, resource limitations, patient turnover, and variability in patient conditions persist. Strategies to maintain hospital infection control involve rigorous compliance monitoring, staff education, advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), telemedicine, and innovative sanitation methods. The future of hospital infection control may involve increased integration of environmental monitoring, antimicrobial stewardship, and patient participation while leveraging collaboration among healthcare facilities. The review highlights the criticality of hospital infection control and suggests trends and opportunities to strengthen prevention efforts and patient safety.36673754<SEP>Giuseppe Davide Albano<SEP>Implementation of A Year-Long Antimicrobial Stewardship Program in A 227-Bed Community Hospital in Southern Italy<SEP>Background: Healthcare-Acquired Infections (HAIs) are serious healthcare complications affecting hospital stay, in-hospital mortality, and costs. Root cause analysis has identified the inappropriate use of antibiotics as the main causative factor in the expansion of multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDRO) in our hospital. An Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) program was implemented to optimize antibiotic use, limit the development of resistance, improve therapeutic efficacy and clinical outcomes, and reduce costs. Methods: The stewardship strategies were: antimicrobial oversight on \"critical\" antibiotics; the development of hospital guidelines on antibiotic selection with the production of a consensus document; the implementation of clinical and management control algorithms with visual impact and Business Intelligence methods; training and updating; and the monitoring of outcome measures and process indicators. Results: Clinical outcomes: length of stay reduced by 0.23 days, hospital readmission/first month rates decreased by 19%, and mortality for infections reduced by 8.8%. Microbiological Outcomes: Clostridium Difficile colitis incidence reduced by 9.1%.Economic Outcomes: Reduction in antimicrobial costs by 35% on average fee/discharged patient. Conclusions: The systematic application of the AMS program in a small hospital led to multiple improvements in clinical, microbiological, and economic outcome measures. The analysis of the core indicators for our hospital AMS program showed a significant adherence to the model and hospital recommendations.35355078<SEP>Amy Chang<SEP>BSAC Vanguard Series: Artificial intelligence and antibiotic stewardship<SEP>Antimicrobial stewardship is a key facet in preventing antimicrobial resistance but can be difficult to put into practice. Frontline providers are faced with the unknowns of pending culture data plus the urgency of appropriate antibiotic choice to prevent sepsis-related mortality; this often leads to broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing. Currently available resources lack a customized approach to individual patients. Artificial intelligence (AI) focused on antimicrobial stewardship may create a unique opportunity to provide individualized, real-time recommendations to providers on appropriate, but narrower spectrum, antibiotic options. We envision that, with further advances in AI, personalized clinical decision support tools to optimize antibiotic prescribing could be available within the next decade.",

    "context": "35060917<SEP>Camille Masselot<SEP>Implementing the Co-Immune Open Innovation Program to Address Vaccination Hesitancy and Access to Vaccines: Retrospective Study<SEP>Background: The rise of major complex public health problems, such as vaccination hesitancy and access to vaccination, requires innovative, open, and transdisciplinary approaches. Yet, institutional silos and lack of participation on the part of nonacademic citizens in the design of solutions hamper efforts to meet these challenges. Against this background, new solutions have been explored, with participatory research, citizen science, hackathons, and challenge-based approaches being applied in the context of public health. Objective: Our aim was to develop a program for creating citizen science and open innovation projects that address the contemporary challenges of vaccination in France and around the globe. Methods: We designed and implemented Co-Immune, a program created to tackle the question of vaccination hesitancy and access to vaccination through an online and offline challenge-based open innovation approach. The program was run on the open science platform Just One Giant Lab. Results: Over a 6-month period, the Co-Immune program gathered 234 participants of diverse backgrounds and 13 partners from the public and private sectors. The program comprised 10 events to facilitate the creation of 20 new projects, as well as the continuation of two existing projects, to address the issues of vaccination hesitancy and access, ranging from app development and data mining to analysis and game design. In an open framework, the projects made their data, code, and solutions publicly available. Conclusions: Co-Immune highlights how open innovation approaches and online platforms can help to gather and coordinate noninstitutional communities in a rapid, distributed, and global way toward solving public health issues. Such initiatives can lead to the production and transfer of knowledge, creating novel solutions in the public health sector. The example of Co-Immune contributes to paving the way for organizations and individuals to collaboratively tackle future global challenges.36811031<SEP>Gemma Mollev\u00ed Bortol\u00f3<SEP>Sustainable, technological, and innovative challenges post Covid-19 in health, economy, and education sectors<SEP>The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has caused an evolution in the business use of Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and New Technologies in general.

The specific objectives of the article are: 1) the impact of new technologies on society during confinement; 2) to understand the use of Big Data for the creation of new products and businesses and 3) to assess which businesses and companies and from which economic sectors have emerged, which have been transformed and which have disappeared.37112702<SEP>Lora Shimp<SEP>Addressing Immunization Inequity-What Have the International Community and India Learned over 35 Years?<SEP>Countries around the world established immunization programs over 40 years ago to reach all infants. The maturity of these preventive health programs offers some useful learning on the importance of, and components needed for, population-based services to reach all communities. A public health success, ensuring equity in immunization, requires a multi-faceted approach that includes sustained government and partner commitment and human, financial, and program operational resources. Evidence from India's Universal Immunization Program (UIP) across stabilizing vaccine supply and services, enhancing access, and generating demand for vaccines in the community provides a useful case study. The political leadership in India took advantage of the two decades of learning from polio eradication and focused initiatives, such as the National Health Mission and Intensified Mission Indradhanush, to reach populations with immunization services. With a goal of leaving no one behind, India's UIP and partners are bringing essential rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccines nationwide, upgrading vaccine cold chain and supply systems with technologies, such as the electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network (eVIN), and optimizing funding for local needs through the Program Implementation Plan (PIP) budgetary processes and building health worker capacities through training, awareness, and e-learning.29942382<SEP>Kimberly Harding<SEP>Global Health Innovation Technology Models<SEP>Chronic technology and business process disparities between High Income, Low Middle Income and Low Income (HIC, LMIC, LIC) research collaborators directly prevent the growth of sustainable Global Health innovation for infectious and rare diseases.

We will validate this architecture framework through our programme called Project Orchid. Project Orchid is a conceptual Clinical Intelligence Exchange and Virtual Innovation platform utilizing this approach to support clinical innovation efforts for multi-national collaboration that can be locally sustainable for LIC and LMIC research cohorts. The goal is to enable LIC and LMIC research organizations to accelerate their clinical trial process maturity in the field of drug discovery, population health innovation initiatives and public domain knowledge networks. When sponsored, this concept will be tested by 12 confirmed clinical research and public health organizations in six countries. The potential impact of this platform is reduced drug discovery and public health innovation lag time and improved clinical trial interventions, due to reliable clinical intelligence and bio-surveillance across all phases of the clinical innovation process.",
    "answer": "The advantages of vaccination include:\n\n1. Prevention of diseases: Vaccines help prevent infectious diseases by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies without causing the disease itself. This reduces the risk of contracting and spreading vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\n2. Herd immunity: Vaccination not only protects the individual who receives the vaccine but also helps protect the community by reducing the overall spread of diseases. This concept, known as herd immunity, is especially important for those who cannot be vaccinated, such as individuals with weakened immune systems.\n\n3. Cost-effective: Vaccines are cost-effective compared to the costs associated with treating diseases that could have been prevented through vaccination. By preventing illnesses, vaccines help save money on healthcare expenses.\n\n4. Saves lives: Vaccines have been instrumental in reducing the mortality rates of many infectious diseases. By preventing severe illness and complications, vaccines save lives and improve public health outcomes.\n\n5. Public health benefits: Vaccination programs contribute to public health by reducing the burden of infectious diseases, improving overall population health, and lowering healthcare costs.\n\nOverall, vaccination offers numerous advantages in preventing diseases, protecting communities, saving lives, and promoting public health. These benefits underscore the importance of vaccination in maintaining individual and community well-being.",

The aim of this commentary article is to provide a general perspective and present recent advances on how artificial intelligence can be applied to improve the prediction and diagnosis of six significant complications of diabetes including (1) gestational diabetes, (2) hypoglycemia in the hospital, (3) diabetic retinopathy, (4) diabetic foot ulcers, (5) diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and (6) diabetic nephropathy.36846513<SEP>Sergio A Zaizar-Fregoso<SEP>Using Artificial Intelligence to Develop a Multivariate Model with a Machine Learning Model to Predict Complications in Mexican Diabetic Patients without Arterial Hypertension (National Nested Case-Control Study): Metformin and Elevated Normal Blood Pressure Are Risk Factors, and Obesity Is Protective<SEP>Diabetes mellitus is a disease with no cure that can cause complications and even death. Moreover, over time, it will lead to chronic complications. Predictive models have been used to identify people with a tendency to develop diabetes mellitus. At the same time, there is limited information regarding the chronic complications of patients with diabetes. Our study is aimed at creating a machine-learning model that will be able to identify the risk factors of a diabetic patient developing chronic complications such as amputations, myocardial infarction, stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy. The design is a national nested case-control study with 63,776 patients and 215 predictors with four years of data. Using an XGBoost model, the prediction of chronic complications has an AUC of 84%, and the model has identified the risk factors for chronic complications in patients with diabetes. According to the analysis, the most crucial risk factors based on SHAP values (Shapley additive explanations) are continued management, metformin treatment, age between 68 and 104 years, nutrition consultation, and treatment adherence. But we highlight two exciting findings. The first is a reaffirmation that high blood pressure figures across patients with diabetes without hypertension become a significant risk factor at diastolic > 70 mmHg (OR: 1.095, 95% CI: 1.078-1.113) or systolic > 120 mmHg (OR: 1.147, 95% CI: 1.124-1.171). Furthermore, people with diabetes with a BMI > 32 (overall obesity) (OR: 0.816, 95% CI: 0.8-0.833) have a statistically significant protective factor, which the paradox of obesity may explain. In conclusion, the results we have obtained show that artificial intelligence is a powerful and feasible tool to use for this type of study. However, we suggest that more studies be conducted to verify and elaborate upon our findings.32704413<SEP>Livia Faes<SEP>A Clinician's Guide to Artificial Intelligence: How to Critically Appraise Machine Learning Studies<SEP>In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the prospect of machine learning models demonstrating expert-level diagnosis in multiple disease contexts.

This article aims to empower clinicians and researchers to critically appraise studies of clinical applications of machine learning, through: (1) introducing basic machine learning concepts and nomenclature; (2) outlining key applicable principles of evidence-based medicine; and (3) highlighting some of the potential pitfalls in the design and reporting of these studies.36329678<SEP>Lucija Gosak<SEP>Artificial intelligence based prediction models for individuals at risk of multiple diabetic complications: A systematic review of the literature<SEP>Aim: The aim of this review is to examine the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in predicting multimorbid diabetes-related complications. Background: In diabetic patients, several complications are often present, which have a significant impact on the quality of life; therefore, it is crucial to predict the level of risk for diabetes and its complications. Evaluation: International databases PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE and Scopus were searched using the terms artificial intelligence, diabetes mellitus and prediction of complications to identify studies on the effectiveness of artificial intelligence for predicting multimorbid diabetes-related complications. The results were organized by outcomes to allow more efficient comparison. Key issues: Based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 11 articles were included in the final analysis. The most frequently predicted complications were diabetic neuropathy (n = 7). Authors included from two to a maximum of 14 complications. The most commonly used prediction models were penalized regression, random forest and Na\u00efve Bayes model neural network. Conclusion: The use of artificial intelligence can predict the risks of diabetes complications with greater precision based on available multidimensional datasets and provides an important tool for nurses working in preventive health care.

The lack of databases on interactions between the immune system and NMs affects the discovery of new NMs for immunotherapy. Complement activation and inhibition by NMs have been widely studied, but the general rules remain unclear. Biomimetic nanocoating to promote the clearance of NMs by the immune system is an alternative strategy for the immune response mediation of the biological corona. Immune response predictions based on NM properties can facilitate the design of NMs for immunotherapy, and artificial intelligences deserve much attention in the field.

For small molecules, less animal data is often needed because there are a multitude of in vitro screening tools and simulation-based approaches to quantify uptake and deliver data that makes extrapolation to in vivo studies feasible. Small molecule simulations work because these materials often diffuse quickly and partition after reaching equilibrium shortly after dosing, but this cannot be applied to NMs. NMs interact with cells through energy dependent pathways, often taking hours or days to become fully internalized within the cellular environment. In vitro screening tools must capture these phenomena so that cell simulations built on mechanism-based models can deliver relationships between exposure dose and mechanistic biology, that is biology representative of fundamental processes involved in NM transport by cells (e.g. membrane adsorption and subsequent internalization). Here, we developed, validated, and applied the FORECAST method, a combination of a calibrated fluorescence assay (CF) with an artificial intelligence-based cell simulation to quantify rates descriptive of the time-dependent mechanistic biological interactions between NMs and individual cells. This work is expected to provide a means of extrapolation to pre-clinical or human biodistribution with cellular level resolution for NMs starting only from in vitro data.34280907<SEP>Hasaan Hayat<SEP>A concise review: the synergy between artificial intelligence and biomedical nanomaterials that empowers nanomedicine<SEP>Nanomedicine has recently experienced unprecedented growth and development.

Preschool wheezing exhibits both \"curricular\" and \"aetiological\" heterogeneity: that is, heterogeneity across patients both in the time-course of its development and in its underpinning pathological mechanisms. Since these are not fully understood, but clinical presentations across patients may nonetheless be similar, current diagnostic labels are imprecise-not mapping cleanly onto underlying disease mechanisms-and prognoses uncertain. These uncertainties also make a identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention difficult. In the past few decades, carefully designed birth cohort studies have collected \"big data\" on a large scale, incorporating not only a wealth of longitudinal clinical data, but also detailed information from modalities as varied as imaging, multiomics, and blood biomarkers. The profusion of big data has seen the proliferation of what we term \"modern data approaches\" (MDAs)-grouping together machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science-to make sense and make use of this data. In this review, we survey applications of MDAs (with an emphasis on machine learning) in childhood wheeze and asthma, highlighting the extent of their successes in providing tools for prognosis, unpicking the curricular heterogeneity of these conditions, clarifying the limitations of current diagnostic criteria, and indicating directions of research for uncovering the etiology of the diseases underlying these conditions. Specifically, we focus on the trajectories of childhood wheeze phenotypes. Further, we provide an explainer of the nature and potential use of MDAs and emphasize the scope of what we can hope to achieve with them.37563691<SEP>Aynaz Lotfata<SEP>Socioeconomic and environmental determinants of asthma prevalence: a cross-sectional study at the U.S. County level using geographically weighted random forests<SEP>Background: Some studies have established associations between the prevalence of new-onset asthma and asthma exacerbation and socioeconomic and environmental determinants. However, research remains limited concerning the shape of these associations, the importance of the risk factors, and how these factors vary geographically. Objective: We aimed (1) to examine ecological associations between asthma prevalence and multiple socio-physical determinants in the United States; and (2) to assess geographic variations in their relative importance. Methods: Our study design is cross sectional based on county-level data for 2020 across the United States. We obtained self-reported asthma prevalence data of adults aged 18 years or older for each county. We applied conventional and geographically weighted random forest (GWRF) to investigate the associations between asthma prevalence and socioeconomic (e.g., poverty) and environmental determinants (e.g., air pollution and green space). To enhance the interpretability of the GWRF, we (1) assessed the shape of the associations through partial dependence plots, (2) ranked the determinants according to their global importance scores, and (3) mapped the local variable importance spatially. Results: Of the 3059 counties, the average asthma prevalence was 9.9 (standard deviation \u00b1 0.99). The GWRF outperformed the conventional random forest. We found an indication, for example, that temperature was inversely associated with asthma prevalence, while poverty showed positive associations. The partial dependence plots showed that these associations had a non-linear shape. Ranking the socio-physical environmental factors concerning their global importance showed that smoking prevalence and depression prevalence were most relevant, while green space and limited language were of minor relevance. The local variable importance measures showed striking geographical differences. Conclusion: Our findings strengthen the evidence that socio-physical environments play a role in explaining asthma prevalence, but their relevance seems to vary geographically. The results are vital for implementing future asthma prevention programs that should be tailor-made for specific areas.38110652<SEP>Nestor A Molfino<SEP>Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Asthma Exacerbations: A Narrative Review<SEP>The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in healthcare has garnered significant attention in recent years, especially as a result of their potential to revolutionize personalized medicine. Despite advances in the treatment and management of asthma, a significant proportion of patients continue to suffer acute exacerbations, irrespective of disease severity and therapeutic regimen. The situation is further complicated by the constellation of factors that influence disease activity in a patient with asthma, such as medical history, biomarker phenotype, pulmonary function, level of healthcare access, treatment compliance, comorbidities, personal habits, and environmental conditions. A growing body of work has demonstrated the potential for AI and ML to accurately predict asthma exacerbations while also capturing the entirety of the patient experience. However, application in the clinical setting remains mostly unexplored, and important questions on the strengths and limitations of this technology remain. This review presents an overview of the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and ML integration into asthma management by providing a snapshot of the existing scientific evidence and proposing potential avenues for future applications.34945107<SEP>Tony Jung<SEP>Early Diagnosis and Real-Time Monitoring of Regional Lung Function Changes to Prevent Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Progression to Severe Emphysema<SEP>First- and second-hand exposure to smoke or air pollutants is the primary cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis, where genetic and age-related factors predispose the subject to the initiation and progression of obstructive lung disease. Briefly, airway inflammation, specifically bronchitis, initiates the lung disease, leading to difficulty in breathing (dyspnea) and coughing as initial symptoms, followed by air trapping and inhibition of the flow of air into the lungs due to damage to the alveoli (emphysema). In addition, mucus obstruction and impaired lung clearance mechanisms lead to recurring acute exacerbations causing progressive decline in lung function, eventually requiring lung transplant and other lifesaving interventions to prevent mortality. It is noteworthy that COPD is much more common in the population than currently diagnosed, as only 16 million adult Americans were reported to be diagnosed with COPD as of 2018, although an additional 14 million American adults were estimated to be suffering from COPD but undiagnosed by the current standard of care (SOC) diagnostic, namely the spirometry-based pulmonary function test (PFT). Thus, the main issue driving the adverse disease outcome and significant mortality for COPD is lack of timely diagnosis in the early stages of the disease. The current treatment regime for COPD emphysema is most effective when implemented early, on COPD onset, where alleviating symptoms and exacerbations with timely intervention(s) can prevent steep lung function decline(s) and disease progression to severe emphysema. Therefore, the key to efficiently combatting COPD relies on early detection. Thus, it is important to detect early regional pulmonary function and structural changes to monitor modest disease progression for implementing timely interventions and effectively eliminating emphysema progression. Currently, COPD diagnosis involves using techniques such as COPD screening questionnaires, PFT, arterial blood gas analysis, and/or lung imaging, but these modalities are limited in their capability for early diagnosis and real-time disease monitoring of regional lung function changes. Hence, promising emerging techniques, such as X-ray phase contrast, photoacoustic tomography, ultrasound computed tomography, electrical impedance tomography, the forced oscillation technique, and the impulse oscillometry system powered by robust artificial intelligence and machine learning analysis capability are emerging as novel solutions for early detection and real time monitoring of COPD progression for timely intervention. We discuss here the scope, risks, and limitations of current SOC and emerging COPD diagnostics, with perspective on novel diagnostics providing real time regional lung function monitoring, and predicting exacerbation and/or disease onset for prognosis-based timely intervention(s) to limit COPD-emphysema progression.",

    "question": "Which groups are susceptible to lung cancer?",
    "context": "33571312<SEP>Witness Mapanga<SEP>Consensus study on the health system and patient-related barriers for lung cancer management in South Africa<SEP>Background: Lung cancer is the highest incident cancer globally and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality particularly if identified at a late stage. Poor patient outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC's) might reflect contextual patient and health system constraints at multiple levels, that act as barriers to prevention, disease recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. Lung cancer screening, even for high-risk patients, is not available in the public health sector in South Africa (SA), where the current HIV and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics often take precedence. Yet, there has been no formal assessment of the individual and health-system related barriers that may delay patients with lung cancer from seeking and accessing help within the public health care system and receiving the appropriate and effective diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to derive consensus from health-system stakeholders in the urban Gauteng Province of SA on the most important challenges faced by the health services and patients in achieving optimum lung cancer management and to identify potential solutions. Methods: The study was undertaken among 27 participant stakeholders representing clinical managers, clinicians, opinion leaders from the public health sector and non-governmental organisation (NGO) representatives. The study compromised two components: consensus and engagement. For the consensus component, the Delphi Technique was employed with open-ended questions and item ranking from five rounds of consensus-seeking, to achieve collective agreement on the most important challenges faced by patients and the health services in achieving optimal lung cancer management. For the engagement component, the Nominal Group Technique was used to articulate ideas and reach an agreement on the group's recommendations for solution strategies and approaches. Results: Public health sector stakeholders suggested that a lack of knowledge and awareness of lung cancer, and the apparent stigma associated with the disease and its risk factors, as well as symptoms and signs, are critical to treatment delay. Furthermore, delays in up-referral of patients with suspected lung cancer from district health care level were attributed to inadequate knowledge arising from a lack of in-service training of nurses and doctors regarding oncologic symptoms, risk factors, need for further investigation, interpretation of x-rays and available treatments. At a tertiary level, participants suggested that insufficient availability of specialised diagnostic resources (imaging, cytological and pathological services including biomolecular assessment of lung cancer), theatres, cardiothoracic surgeons, and appropriate therapeutic modalities (chemotherapeutic agents and radiation oncology) are the main barriers to the provision of optimal care. It was suggested that a primary prevention programme initiated by the government that involves private-public partnerships may improve lung cancer management nationally. Conclusions: Considerable barriers to the early identification and treatment of lung cancer exist. Finding solutions to overcome both individual and health-system level obstacles to lung cancer screening and management are vital to facilitate early identification and treatment, and to improve survival. Furthermore, research on inexpensive biomarkers for asymptomatic disease detection, the introduction of diagnostic imaging tools that utilise artificial intelligence to compensate for inadequate human resources and improving clinical integration across all levels of the healthcare system are essential.33297774<SEP>Amy Zarzeczny<SEP>Artificial intelligence-based imaging analytics and lung cancer diagnostics: Considerations for health system leaders<SEP>Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in Canada, and accurate, early diagnosis are critical to improving clinical outcomes. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based imaging analytics are a promising healthcare innovation that aim to improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer diagnosis. Maximizing their clinical potential while mitigating their risks and limitations will require focused leadership informed by interdisciplinary expertise and system-wide insight. We convened a knowledge exchange workshop with diverse Saskatchewan health system leaders and stakeholders to explore issues surrounding the use of AI in diagnostic imaging for lung cancer, including implementation opportunities, challenges, and priorities. This technology is anticipated to improve patient outcomes, reduce unnecessary healthcare spending, and increase knowledge. However, health system leaders must also address the needs for robust data, financial investment, effective communication and collaboration between healthcare sectors, privacy and data protections, and continued interdisciplinary research to achieve this technology's potential benefits.37583965<SEP>Maria Joana Catarata<SEP>ERS International Congress 2022: highlights from the Thoracic Oncology Assembly<SEP>Thoracic malignancies are associated with a substantial public health burden. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with significant impact on patients' quality of life. Following 2 years of virtual European Respiratory Society (ERS) Congresses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2022 hybrid ERS Congress in Barcelona, Spain allowed peers from all over the world to meet again and present their work. Thoracic oncology experts presented best practices and latest developments in lung cancer screening, lung cancer diagnosis and management. Early lung cancer diagnosis, subsequent pros and cons of aggressive management, identification and management of systemic treatments' side-effects, and the application of artificial intelligence and biomarkers across all aspects of the thoracic oncology pathway were among the areas that triggered specific interest and will be summarised here.34217418<SEP>Christine Campbell<SEP>COVID-19 and cancer screening in Scotland: A national and coordinated approach to minimising harm<SEP>Screening is an important component of cancer control internationally. In Scotland, the National Health Service Scotland provides screening programmes for cervical, bowel and breast cancers. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the suspension of these programmes in March 2020. We describe the integrated approach to managing the impact of the pandemic on cancer screening programmes in Scotland throughout 2020. We outline the policy context and decision-making process leading to suspension, and the criteria and framework informing the subsequent, staggered, restart in subsequent months. The decision to suspend screening services in order to protect screening invitees and staff, and manage NHS capacity, was made after review of numbers of screening participants likely to be affected, and the potential number of delayed cancer diagnoses. Restart principles and a detailed route map plan were developed for each programme, seeking to ensure broad consistency of approach across the programmes and nationally. Early data indicates bowel, breast and cervical screening participation has increased since restart. Primary care has had to adapt to new infection prevention control measures for delivery of cervical screening. Cancer charities provided cancer intelligence and policy briefs to national bodies and Scottish Government, as well as supporting the public, patients and screening invitees through information and awareness campaigns. Emerging from the pandemic, there is recognition of the need and the opportunity to transform and renew both cancer and screening services in Scotland, and in particular to address long-standing workforce capacity problems through innovation and investment, and to continue to prioritise addressing health inequalities.",
    "answer": "Groups that are particularly susceptible to lung cancer include individuals in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC's) like South Africa, where barriers exist at multiple levels within the health system that can delay prevention, disease recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. Factors such as lack of knowledge and awareness of lung cancer, stigma associated with the disease, delays in up-referral of patients with suspected lung cancer, inadequate training of healthcare providers regarding oncologic symptoms, and insufficient availability of specialized diagnostic resources and therapeutic modalities are key challenges. Additionally, populations with a history of smoking, exposure to environmental carcinogens, advanced age, and genetic predispositions are also at higher risk for developing lung cancer. Early identification and treatment of lung cancer are crucial in improving patient outcomes and survival rates.",

    "question": "What are the different eating disorder types?",
    "context": "26435836<SEP>Andrea Phillipou<SEP>Are personality disturbances in anorexia nervosa related to emotion processing or eating disorder symptomatology?<SEP>Background: Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric illness associated with a number of personality disturbances. However, whether these personality characteristics are related to eating disorder symptomatology or emotion regulation is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate these relationships. Results: Twenty-four individuals with AN and 25 age- and premorbid intelligence-matched controls completed the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire, and scores were correlated with measures of emotionality and negative mood states, and eating disorder symptomatology. AN was associated with increased scores on schizoid, borderline, avoidant, dependent, obsessive compulsive, negativistic and depressive personality dimensions, relative to controls. In AN, eating disorder symptomatology did not significantly correlate with scores on any personality dimension. However, a number of personality characteristics were found to correlate with negative mood states. Conclusions: The findings suggest that personality disturbances in AN are not related to disorder-specific symptoms, but are related to negative mood states.32767255<SEP>J Cholet<SEP>Evaluation of cognitive impairment in a French sample of patients with restrictive anorexia nervosa: two distinct profiles emerged with differences in impaired functions and psychopathological symptoms<SEP>Purpose: The cognitive profiles of patients suffering from anorexia nervosa (AN) are currently explored as potential facilitating and/or maintenance factors. Specific data in restrictive AN (AN-R) remain contradictory. This study focused on women with AN-R to evaluate their cognitive functions to develop a more specific cognitive remediation program. Methods: Female patients older than 15 years who were suffering from AN-R were recruited in a specialized unit for eating disorder management. Female healthy control (HC) participants were recruited who were matched with AN patients on age. All participants completed a cognitive evaluation (premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ), planning, information processing speed, cognitive flexibility) and a clinical evaluation (impulsivity, anxiety, depression). Results: A total of 122 participants were included. Patients suffering from AN-R had significant impairment in information processing speed and planning. Patients exhibited significantly better cognitive flexibility than did the HC group when adjustments were made for other cognitive functions and impulsivity. Two distinct subgroups of patients were identified. The first subgroup had more marked cognitive impairment and fewer psychopathological symptoms than did the second subgroup of patients and the HC group. Conclusion: Our results highlight cognitive impairment in patients with AN who had normal premorbid IQ. Two distinct profiles emerge. In clinical practice, these results open up perspectives for the development of more specific cognitive remediation programs (one specific program for cold cognitions and another specific program targeting emotions and hot cognitions). These results warrant confirmation by larger studies with a more specific evaluation of the impact of emotional status. Trial registration NTC02381639, Date of registration. March 6, 2015.23682062<SEP>Leehu Zysberg<SEP>Emotional intelligence, personality, and gender as factors in disordered eating patterns<SEP>We examined the hypotheses that proposing higher levels of emotional intelligence (ability test and self-report) and lower neuroticism, extraversion, and agreeableness associate with lower levels of disordered eating. In a correlational study, 126 Israeli college students completed two measures of emotional intelligence, a brief five-factor personality test, demographic data questionnaires, and questionnaires assessing food preoccupation, namely, the Body Weight, Image and Self-Esteem Scale and the Appearance Schema Inventory. Results suggested that ability emotional intelligence is associated with disordered eating beyond gender and personality. Self-reported emotional intelligence did not associate with any of the outcomes after controlling for personality. Implications and applications are briefly discussed.33746572<SEP>Keizaburo Ogata<SEP>The relationship between premorbid intelligence and symptoms of severe anorexia nervosa restricting type<SEP>The purposes of this study were as follows: to compare premorbid IQ with present IQ in patients with more severe anorexia nervosa restricting type (AN-R) and to investigate the relationship between decreasing IQ and symptoms in patients with severe AN-R. Twenty-two participants were recruited (12 were AN-R patients; 10 were healthy controls). The average BMI in AN-R patients and healthy controls was 12.65 and 19.82, respectively. We assessed the outcomes using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III), the Japanese Adult Reading Test, The Eating Disorders Inventory-2 (EDI-2), Beck Depression Scale-2 (BDI-2) and State-Trait Anxiety Index. In two-way ANOVA, there were significant interactions for the FIQ and PIQ. Only in the AN-R group, a significant single main effect of time was evidenced for the FIQ and PIQ. In the AN-R group, a significantly high positive correlation was found between changes in the PIQ and the body dissatisfaction subscale of the EDI-2. These findings raise the possibility that in patients with severe AN-R, an excessive decrease in body weight induces decreased PIQ; as a result, they have worse dissatisfaction with their body shape.",

    "context": "33978593<SEP>Kobra Etminani<SEP>Improving Medication Adherence Through Adaptive Digital Interventions (iMedA) in Patients With Hypertension: Protocol for an Interrupted Time Series Study<SEP>Background: There is a strong need to improve medication adherence (MA) for individuals with hypertension in order to reduce long-term hospitalization costs. We believe this can be achieved through an artificial intelligence agent that helps the patient in understanding key individual adherence risk factors and designing an appropriate intervention plan. The incidence of hypertension in Sweden is estimated at approximately 27%. Although blood pressure control has increased in Sweden, barely half of the treated patients achieved adequate blood pressure levels. It is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke as well as heart failure. MA is a key factor for good clinical outcomes in persons with hypertension. Objective: The overall aim of this study is to design, develop, test, and evaluate an adaptive digital intervention called iMedA, delivered via a mobile app to improve MA, self-care management, and blood pressure control for persons with hypertension. Methods: The study design is an interrupted time series. We will collect data on a daily basis, 14 days before, during 6 months of delivering digital interventions through the mobile app, and 14 days after. The effect will be analyzed using segmented regression analysis. The participants will be recruited in Region Halland, Sweden. The design of the digital interventions follows the just-in-time adaptive intervention framework. The primary (distal) outcome is MA, and the secondary outcome is blood pressure. The design of the digital intervention is developed based on a needs assessment process including a systematic review, focus group interviews, and a pilot study, before conducting the longitudinal interrupted time series study. Results: The focus groups of persons with hypertension have been conducted to perform the needs assessment in a Swedish context. The design and development of digital interventions are in progress, and the interventions are planned to be ready in November 2020. Then, the 2-week pilot study for usability evaluation will start, and the interrupted time series study, which we plan to start in February 2021, will follow it. Conclusions: We hypothesize that iMedA will improve medication adherence and self-care management. This study could illustrate how self-care management tools can be an additional (digital) treatment support to a clinical one without increasing burden on health care staff.

As such, there is an increasing need for the scientific community to adopt effective and efficient methods to examine the potential role and contribution of social sciences in the fight against COVID-19. Objectives: This study aims to identify the key topics and explore publishing trends in social science research pertaining to COVID-19 via automated literature analysis. Methods: The automated literature analysis employed utilizes keyword analysis and topic modelling technique, specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation, to highlight the most relevant research terms, overarching research themes and research trends within the realm of social science research on COVID-19. Results: The focus of research and topics were derived from 9733 full-text academic papers. The bulk of social science research on COVID-19 centres on the following themes: 'Clinical Treatment', 'Epidemic Crisis', 'Mental Influence', 'Impact on Students', 'Lockdown Influence' and 'Impact on Children'. Conclusion: This study adds to our understanding of key topics in social science research on COVID-19. The automated literature analysis presented is particularly useful for librarians and information specialists keen to explore the role and contributions of social science topics in the context of pandemics.30172038<SEP>Stephen D Persell<SEP>Design of a randomized controlled trial comparing a mobile phone-based hypertension health coaching application to home blood pressure monitoring alone: The Smart Hypertension Control Study<SEP>Background: Hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality but frequently remains uncontrolled. A smartphone application that provides coaching regarding home blood pressure monitoring and other aspects of hypertension self-care and related behavior change may be a scalable way to help manage hypertension. Methods/design: The Smart Hypertension Control Study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a hypertension personal control program (HPCP), which consists of an automated artificial intelligence smartphone application that provides individualized support and coaching to promote home monitoring and healthy behavior changes related to hypertension self-management. Enrolled adults with uncontrolled hypertension will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the HPCP with home blood pressure monitoring or to home monitoring alone. We plan to enroll 350 participants, with a target of 300 participants with complete six-month follow-up data. The primary study outcome will be systolic blood pressure at six months. Additional outcomes include measures of antihypertensive medication adherence, home blood pressure monitoring practices, self-management practices, weight, and self-reported health behaviors. Conclusion: The Smart Hypertension Control Study will evaluate blood pressure and hypertension self-management behavior outcomes in participants with uncontrolled hypertension exposed to a smartphone-based hypertension health coaching application in addition to home blood pressure monitoring compared to those exposed to home blood pressure monitoring alone.34871178<SEP>Binh Nguyen<SEP>Digital Interventions to Reduce Distress Among Health Care Providers at the Frontline: Protocol for a Feasibility Trial<SEP>Background: Stress, anxiety, distress, and depression are high among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they have reported acting in ways that are contrary to their moral values and professional commitments that degrade their integrity. This creates moral distress and injury due to constraints they have encountered, such as limited resources. Objective: The purpose of this study is to develop and show the feasibility of digital platforms (a virtual reality and a mobile platform) to understand the causes and ultimately reduce the moral distress of health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This will be a prospective, single cohort, pre- and posttest study examining the effect of a brief informative video describing moral distress on perceptual, psychological, and physiological indicators of stress and decision-making during a scenario known to potentially elicit moral distress. To accomplish this, we have developed a virtual reality simulation that will be used before and after the digital intervention for monitoring short-term impacts. The simulation involves an intensive care unit setting during the COVID-19 pandemic, and participants will be placed in morally challenging situations. The participants will be engaged in an educational intervention at the individual, team, and organizational levels. During each test, data will be collected for (1) physiological measures of stress and after each test, data will be collected regarding (2) thoughts, feelings and behaviors during a morally challenging situation, and (3) perceptual estimates of psychological stress. In addition, participants will continue to be monitored for moral distress and other psychological stresses for 8 weeks through our Digital intervention/intelligence Group mobile platform. Finally, a comparison will be conducted using machine learning and biostatistical techniques to analyze the short- and long-term impacts of the virtual reality intervention. Results: The study was funded in November 2020 and received research ethics board approval in March 2021. The study is ongoing. Conclusions: This project is a proof-of-concept integration to demonstrate viability over 6 months and guide future studies to develop these state-of-the-art technologies to help frontline health care workers work in complex moral contexts. In addition, the project will develop innovations that can be used for future pandemics and in other contexts prone to producing moral distress and injury. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using digital platforms to understand the continuum of moral distress that can lead to moral injury. Demonstration of feasibility will lead to future studies to examine the efficacy of digital platforms to reduce moral distress.

    "context": "26703116<SEP>F Langlands<SEP>Contralateral breast cancer: incidence according to ductal or lobular phenotype of the primary<SEP>Aim: To identify differences in the incidence of contralateral breast cancer between patients with a primary tumour diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and those with a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Materials and methods: Data from two large cancer registries (registry A & B) the Northern and Yorkshire Cancer Registry Information Service (NYCRIS) and the West Midlands Cancer Intelligence Unit (WMCIU) from 1998-2003 for all cases of invasive breast cancer of either pure ductal or pure lobular reported histology were obtained. The invasive status of the contralateral tumour diagnosis and tumour morphology was collected. Chi-square tests were undertaken to examine the differences in contralateral rates for both registries and univariate analysis to ascertain which predictors affected contralateral breast cancer risk for registry A the WMCIU cases. Results: A total of 38,132 patients were studied, 32,735 patients with IDC and 5397 (14.2%) patients with ILC over the 6-year period. There was no significant difference between the occurrence and time to occurrence of contralateral breast cancer according to original cancer histology, 901 (2.8%) patients with IDC versus 166 (3.1%) patients with ILC (p=0.169). The analysis of registry A cases showed no association between original histology (ductal versus lobular), age at diagnosis, tumour grade, use of radiotherapy for the primary cancer or use of systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy), and development of a contralateral breast cancer. Conclusion: There is no apparent increase in risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer according to the primary cancer histology either IDC or ILC. Standard mammographic follow-up does not need to take account of original tumour pathology. Increased intervention or post-treatment surveillance for the contralateral breast is not indicated in the context of ILC. The role of MRI should be restricted to those patients with ILC who are planning breast-conservation surgery, but not for assessing the contralateral breast.35128368<SEP>S J Lord<SEP>De novo and recurrent metastatic breast cancer - A systematic review of population-level changes in survival since 1995<SEP>Background: Advances in breast cancer (BC) care have reduced mortality, but their impact on survival once diagnosed with metastasis is less well described. This systematic review aimed to describe population-level survival since 1995 for de novo metastatic BC (dnMBC) and recurrent MBC (rMBC). Methods: We searched MEDLINE 01/01/1995-12/04/2021 to identify population-based cohort studies of MBC reporting overall (OS) or BC-specific survival (BCSS) over time. We appraised risk-of-bias and summarised survival descriptively for MBC diagnoses in 5-year periods from 1995 until 2014; and for age, hormone receptor and HER2 subgroups. Findings: We identified 20 eligible studies (14 dnMBC, 1 rMBC, 5 combined). Potential sources of bias in these studies were confounding and shorter follow-up for the latest diagnosis period.For dnMBC, 13 of 14 studies reported improved OS or BCSS since 1995. In 2005-2009, the median OS was 26 months (range 24-30), a median gain of 6 months since 1995-1999 (range 0-9, 4 studies). Median 5-year OS was 23% in 2005-2009, a median gain of 7% since 1995-1999 (range -2 to 14%, 4 studies). For women \u226570 years, the median and 5-year OS was unchanged (1 study) with no to modest difference in relative survival (range: -1\u00b79% (p = 0.71) to +2\u00b71% (p = 0.045), 3 studies). For rMBC, one study reported no change in survival between 1998 and 2006 and 2007-2013 (median OS 23 months). For combined MBC, 76-89% had rMBC. Three of four studies observed no change in median OS after 2000. Of these, one study reported median OS improved for women \u226460 years (1995-1999 19\u00b71; 2000-2004 22\u00b73 months) but not >60 years (12\u00b77, 11\u00b76 months). Interpretation: Population-level improvements in OS for dnMBC have not been consistently observed in rMBC cohorts nor older women. These findings have implications for counselling patients about prognosis, planning cancer services and trial stratification.

A multidisciplinary approach is essential for earlier detection and improved outcomes.37915669<SEP>Ahsan Rao<SEP>Use of artificial intelligence to identify patients to be assessed in a breast clinic on 2-week wait: a retrospective cohort study<SEP>Background: The number of urgent referrals from primary care to specialist one stop breast clinics continues to rise beyond the capacity of the 2-week wait service. This study aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) to identify patients with new breast symptoms requiring a biopsy to identify those who should be prioritised for urgent breast clinic assessment. Methods: Data were collected retrospectively for patients attending one stop triple assessment breast clinic at Broomfield hospital between 1 June and 1 October 2021. PHP machine learning software was used to run AI on the data to identify patients who had a core biopsy in clinic. Results: A total of 794 cases were referred to one stop breast clinic for new breast symptoms-37 male (4.6%) and 757 female (95.3%). The average age of the patients included was 43.2 years. Five hundred thirty-six patients (67.5%) presented with a breast lump, 180 (22.7%) with breast pain, 61 (7.7%) with changes to shape or skin and 13 (1.6%) with a lump identified by their general practitioner. The patients who had a biopsy were of increased age [52.8 (SD 17.9) vs. 44.1 (SD 16.8), P",
    "answer": "The prevalent cancer types in both genders include breast cancer, which can be classified into different subtypes such as invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Studies have shown that there are no significant differences in the occurrence of contralateral breast cancer based on the original cancer histology, whether it is IDC or ILC. Additionally, advancements in breast cancer care have led to improved overall and breast cancer-specific survival rates for patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) since 1995. However, it is noted that improvements in survival have not been consistently observed in recurrent MBC cohorts or in older women. These findings have implications for counseling patients about prognosis, planning cancer services, and trial stratification. Integrating artificial intelligence into breast cancer risk modeling enables personalized risk assessment by considering factors such as mammographic density, new imaging techniques, pathology, genetic testing, and molecular profiling. This multidisciplinary approach is crucial for earlier detection and improved outcomes in breast cancer management.",

    "context": "24365456<SEP>V A Morgan<SEP>Psychosis prevalence and physical, metabolic and cognitive co-morbidity: data from the second Australian national survey of psychosis<SEP>Background: There are insufficient data from nationwide surveys on the prevalence of specific psychotic disorders and associated co-morbidities. Method: The 2010 Australian national psychosis survey used a two-phase design to draw a representative sample of adults aged 18-64 years with psychotic disorders in contact with public treatment services from an estimated resident population of 1 464 923 adults. This paper is based on data from 1642 participants with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 psychotic disorder. Its aim is to present estimates of treated prevalence and lifetime morbid risk of psychosis, and to describe the cognitive, physical health and substance use profiles of participants. Results: The 1-month treated prevalence of psychotic disorders was 3.10 cases per 1000 population aged 18-64 years, not accounting for people solely accessing primary care services; lifetime morbid risk was 3.45 per 1000. Mean premorbid intelligence quotient was approximately 0.5 s.d.s below the population mean; current cognitive ability (measured with a digit symbol coding task) was 1.6 s.d.s below the population mean. For both cognitive tests, higher scores were significantly associated with better independent functioning. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was high, affecting 60.8% of participants, and pervasive across diagnostic groups. Of the participants, two-thirds (65.9%) were current smokers, 47.4% were obese and 32.4% were sedentary. Of the participants, half (49.8%) had a lifetime history of alcohol abuse/dependence and 50.8% lifetime cannabis abuse/dependence. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive, integrative models of recovery to maximize the potential for good health and quality of life for people with psychotic illness.27336027<SEP>Covadonga M D\u00edaz-Caneja<SEP>Predictors of outcome in early-onset psychosis: a systematic review<SEP>Given the global burden of psychotic disorders, the identification of patients with early-onset psychosis (EOP; that is, onset before the age of 18) at higher risk of adverse outcome should be a priority. A systematic search of Pubmed, Embase, and PsycInfo (1980 through August 2014) was performed to identify longitudinal observational studies assessing correlates and/or predictors of clinical, functional, cognitive, and biological outcomes in EOP. Seventy-five studies were included in the review. Using multivariate models, the most replicated predictors of worse clinical, functional, cognitive, and biological outcomes in EOP were premorbid difficulties and symptom severity (especially of negative symptoms) at baseline. Longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) predicted worse clinical, functional, and cognitive outcomes. Higher risk of attempting suicide was predicted by greater severity of psychotic illness and of depressive symptoms at the first episode of psychosis. Age at onset and sex were not found to be relevant predictors of outcome in most multivariate models, whereas studies using bivariate analyses yielded inconsistent results. Lower intelligence quotient at baseline predicted lower insight at follow-up, worse functional outcomes, and a diagnostic outcome of schizophrenia. Biological predictors of outcome in EOP have been little studied and have not been replicated. Lower levels of antioxidants at baseline predicted greater brain volume changes and worse cognitive functioning at follow-up, whereas neuroimaging markers such as regional cortical thickness and gray matter volume at baseline predicted remission and better insight at follow-up, respectively. EOP patients with poorer premorbid adjustment and prominent negative symptoms at initial presentation are at risk of poor outcome. They should therefore be the target of careful monitoring and more intensive interventions to address whether the disease course can be modified in this especially severely affected group. Early intervention strategies to reduce DUP may also improve outcome in EOP.36905766<SEP>Nancy Murillo-Garc\u00eda<SEP>Intelligence quotient changes over 10 years: Diversity of cognitive profiles in first episode of psychosis and healthy controls<SEP>Objective: This study aimed to analyse whether intelligence quotient (IQ) improves, declines, or remains stable over 10 years among FEP patients and healthy subjects. Methods: A group of FEP patients enrolled in a Program of First Episode Psychosis in Spain called PAFIP, and a sample of Healthy Controls (HC) completed the same neuropsychological battery at baseline and approximately 10 years later, which included the WAIS vocabulary subtest to estimate premorbid IQ and 10-year IQ. Cluster analysis was performed separately in the patient group and the HC group to determine their profiles of intellectual change. Results: One hundred and thirty-seven FEP patients were grouped into five clusters: \"Improved low IQ\" (9.49 % of patients), \"Improved average IQ\" (14.6 %), \"Preserved low IQ\" (17.52 %), \"Preserved average IQ\" (43.06 %), and \"Preserved high IQ\" (15.33 %). Ninety HC were grouped into three clusters: \"Preserved low IQ\" (32.22 % of the HC), \"Preserved average IQ\" (44.44 %), and \"Preserved high IQ\" (23.33 %). The first two clusters of FEP patients, characterized by a low IQ, earlier age at illness onset, and lower educational attainment, showed a substantial cognitive improvement. The remaining clusters demonstrated cognitive stability. Conclusions: The FEP patients showed intellectual improvement or stability, but no decline post-onset of psychosis. However, their profiles of intellectual change are more heterogeneous than that of HC over 10 years. Particularly, there is a subgroup of FEP patients with a significant potential for long-term cognitive enhancement.28734078<SEP>Madeline H Meier<SEP>Associations between adolescent cannabis use and neuropsychological decline: a longitudinal co-twin control study<SEP>Aims: This study tested whether adolescents who used cannabis or met criteria for cannabis dependence showed neuropsychological impairment prior to cannabis initiation and neuropsychological decline from before to after cannabis initiation. Design: A longitudinal co-twin control study. Setting and participants: Participants were 1989 twins from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative birth cohort of twins born in England and Wales from 1994 to 1995. Measurements: Frequency of cannabis use and cannabis dependence were assessed at age 18. Intelligence quotient (IQ) was obtained at ages 5, 12 and 18. Executive functions were assessed at age 18. Findings: Compared with adolescents who did not use cannabis, adolescents who used cannabis had lower IQ in childhood prior to cannabis initiation and lower IQ at age 18, but there was little evidence that cannabis use was associated with IQ decline from ages 12-18. For example, adolescents with cannabis dependence had age 12 and age 18 IQ scores that were 5.61 (t = -3.11, P = 0.002) and 7.34 IQ points (t = -5.27, P < 0.001) lower than adolescents without cannabis dependence, but adolescents with cannabis dependence did not show greater IQ decline from age 12-18 (t = -1.27, P = 0.20). Moreover, adolescents who used cannabis had poorer executive functions at age 18 than adolescents who did not use cannabis, but these associations were generally not apparent within twin pairs. For example, twins who used cannabis more frequently than their co-twin performed similarly to their co-twin on five of six executive function tests (Ps > 0.10). The one exception was that twins who used cannabis more frequently than their co-twin performed worse on one working memory test (Spatial Span reversed; \u03b2 = -0.07, P = 0.036). Conclusions: Short-term cannabis use in adolescence does not appear to cause IQ decline or impair executive functions, even when cannabis use reaches the level of dependence. Family background factors explain why adolescent cannabis users perform worse on IQ and executive function tests.",

    "context": "36276648<SEP>Devika Mukherjee<SEP>Addressing antimicrobial resistance with the IDentif.AI platform: Rapidly optimizing clinically actionable combination therapy regimens against nontuberculous mycobacteria<SEP>Background: Current standard of care (SOC) regimens against nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) usually result in unsatisfactory therapeutic responses, primarily due to multi-drug resistance and antibiotic susceptibility-guided therapies. In the midst of rising incidences in NTM infections, strategies to develop NTM-specific treatments have been explored and validated. Methods: To provide an alternative approach to address NTM-specific treatment, IDentif.AI was harnessed to rapidly optimize and design effective combination therapy regimens against Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus), the highly resistant and rapid growth species of NTM. IDentif.AI interrogated the drug interaction space from a pool of 6 antibiotics, and pinpointed multiple clinically actionable drug combinations. IDentif.AI-pinpointed actionable combinations were experimentally validated and their interactions were assessed using Bliss independence model and diagonal measurement of n-way drug interactions. Results: Notably, IDentfi.AI-designed 3- and 4-drug combinations demonstrated greater %Inhibition efficacy than the SOC regimens. The platform also pinpointed two unique drug interactions (Levofloxacin (LVX)/Rifabutin (RFB) and LVX/Meropenem (MEM)) that may serve as the backbone of potential 3- and 4-drug combinations like LVX/MEM/RFB, which exhibited 58.33\u00b14.99 %Inhibition efficacy against M. abscessus. Further analysis of LVX/RFB via Bliss independence model pointed to dose-dependent synergistic interactions in clinically actionable concentrations. Conclusions: IDentif.AI-designed combinations may provide alternative regimen options to current SOC combinations that are often administered with Amikacin, which has been known to induce ototoxicity in patients. Furthermore, IDentif.AI pinpointed 2-drug interactions may also serve as the backbone for the development of other effective 3- and 4-drug combination therapies. The findings in this study suggest that this platform may contribute to NTM-specific drug development.36646245<SEP>Absar Talat<SEP>Artificial intelligence as a smart approach to develop antimicrobial drug molecules: A paradigm to combat drug-resistant infections<SEP>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a silent pandemic with the third highest global mortality. The antibiotic development pipeline is scarce even though AMR has escalated uncontrollably. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary approach, accelerating drug discovery because of its fast pace, cost efficiency, lower labor requirements, and fewer chances of failure. AI has been used to discover several beta-lactamase inhibitors and antibiotic alternatives from antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), nonribosomal peptides, bacteriocins, and marine natural products. The significant recent increase in the use of AI platforms by pharmaceutical companies could result in the discovery of efficient antibiotic alternatives with lower chances of resistance generation.38352035<SEP>Xiaoxuan Liu<SEP>[Reporting guidelines for clinical trial reports for interventions involving artificial intelligence: the CONSORT-AI extensionDiretrizes para relat\u00f3rios de ensaios cl\u00ednicos com interven\u00e7\u00f5es que utilizam intelig\u00eancia artificial: a extens\u00e3o CONSORT-AI]<SEP>The CONSORT 2010 statement provides minimum guidelines for reporting randomized trials. Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency in the evaluation of new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human-AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases. CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes.34948055<SEP>Murtala A Ejalonibu<SEP>Drug Discovery for Mycobacterium tuberculosis Using Structure-Based Computer-Aided Drug Design Approach<SEP>Developing new, more effective antibiotics against resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis that inhibit its essential proteins is an appealing strategy for combating the global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic. Finding a compound that can target a particular cavity in a protein and interrupt its enzymatic activity is the crucial objective of drug design and discovery. Such a compound is then subjected to different tests, including clinical trials, to study its effectiveness against the pathogen in the host. In recent times, new techniques, which involve computational and analytical methods, enhanced the chances of drug development, as opposed to traditional drug design methods, which are laborious and time-consuming. The computational techniques in drug design have been improved with a new generation of software used to develop and optimize active compounds that can be used in future chemotherapeutic development to combat global tuberculosis resistance. This review provides an overview of the evolution of tuberculosis resistance, existing drug management, and the design of new anti-tuberculosis drugs developed based on the contributions of computational techniques. Also, we show an appraisal of available software and databases on computational drug design with an insight into the application of this software and databases in the development of anti-tubercular drugs.

The ability to track vaccine usage and storage has increased accountability, lowered wastage, protected valuable resources, and provided the correct vaccines at the right time. Sixty-four immunization registries support the current immunization ecosystem, yet all investments to date have been through state and federal funding. Much of the technology supporting these registries is becoming harder to support, limiting the utilization of the data. For the most part all current systems have legacy 2nd-generation technology and architectures as their foundation Current technology investments in these national assets tend to be for systems that within the next five years will not be cost effectively sustainable with only federal, state and local funding. Yet quality data is being reported by immunization providers across the health care network that is increasing exponentially through electronic data exchanges integrated within Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Pharmacy Management Systems (PMS) This increase in high-quality patient immunization records creates opportunity to build immunization intelligence from the data. However, 2nd-generation Immunization Information Systems (IIS) limit the effective and timely use of this information. Considering the increasing value of the data to public and private sectors working to close immunization care gaps in populations, supporting technology must ensure easy access This is the first of two papers that highlights the power of these national registries and the data they contain to provide opportunity intelligence to the immunization ecosystem user community. Paper one illustrates the \"why\" for change and the need for a truly community collaborative path forward to move from 2nd- to 3rd-generation systems through partners that leverages cost sharing and common goals The end goal is to establish new supporting technology assets that accelerate the use of data to impact vaccine preventable disease (VPD) outcomes which create a new model for public-private investments to sustain the IIS national infrastructure.

Yet, institutional silos and lack of participation on the part of nonacademic citizens in the design of solutions hamper efforts to meet these challenges. Against this background, new solutions have been explored, with participatory research, citizen science, hackathons, and challenge-based approaches being applied in the context of public health. Objective: Our aim was to develop a program for creating citizen science and open innovation projects that address the contemporary challenges of vaccination in France and around the globe. Methods: We designed and implemented Co-Immune, a program created to tackle the question of vaccination hesitancy and access to vaccination through an online and offline challenge-based open innovation approach. The program was run on the open science platform Just One Giant Lab. Results: Over a 6-month period, the Co-Immune program gathered 234 participants of diverse backgrounds and 13 partners from the public and private sectors. The program comprised 10 events to facilitate the creation of 20 new projects, as well as the continuation of two existing projects, to address the issues of vaccination hesitancy and access, ranging from app development and data mining to analysis and game design. In an open framework, the projects made their data, code, and solutions publicly available. Conclusions: Co-Immune highlights how open innovation approaches and online platforms can help to gather and coordinate noninstitutional communities in a rapid, distributed, and global way toward solving public health issues. Such initiatives can lead to the production and transfer of knowledge, creating novel solutions in the public health sector. The example of Co-Immune contributes to paving the way for organizations and individuals to collaboratively tackle future global challenges.27752295<SEP>Michael Popovich<SEP>Observations Illustrating the Use of Health Informatics to Link Public Health Immunization Registries and Pharmacies to Increase Adult Immunization Rates and Improve Population Health Outcomes<SEP>The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act encourages health information exchange between clinical care and public health through Meaningful Use measures. Meaningful Use specifically identifies objectives to support a number of public health programs including immunizations, cancer registries, syndromic surveillance, and disease case reports. The objective is to improve public and population health. Stage 2 of Meaningful Use focused on compliance to sending of information to public health. The next phase focuses on bi-directional information exchange to support immunization intelligence and to empower providers, pharmacists, and the consumer. The HITECH Act Stage 2 initiative provided incentive and motivation for healthcare providers to encourage their Electronic Medical Record (EMR) vendors to implement data exchanges with public health, with the expected result being timely awareness of health risks. The empowerment nugget in the HITECH Act is not in the compliance reporting to public health. The nugget is the ability for a provider to receive relevant information on the patient or consumer currently in front of them or to those they will connect to through their outreach efforts. The ability for public health to retain current immunization records of individuals from a variety of providers supports their program goals to increase immunization rates and mitigate the risk of vaccine-preventable disease (VPD). The ability for providers to receive at the point of service more complete immunization histories integrated with decision support enhances their delivery of care, thereby reducing the risk of VPD to their patients. Indirectly payers benefit through healthcare cost savings and when the focus is expanded from a health model to a business model, there are significant return on investment (ROI) opportunities that exponentially increase the value of a bi-directional immunization data exchange. This paper will provide descriptions of case examples to demonstrate the value of electronic data exchanges when pharmacy immunization providers and public health work together.34905441<SEP>Vandana Gurnani<SEP>Return on investment of the electronic vaccine intelligence network in India<SEP>The electronic vaccine intelligence network (eVIN) was introduced by India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 12 states and was implemented by the United Nations Development Programme through the Gavi health system strengthening support during 2014-17 to replace the traditional paper-based cold-chain management system with an electronic vaccine logistics management system. An economic assessment was conducted as part of the overall assessment of eVIN. The objective of the economic assessment was to conduct a return on investment analysis of eVIN implementation. Return on investment was defined as the ratio of total benefits (savings) from eVIN to total investment in eVIN. All costs were calculated in 2020 prices and reported in Indian rupees (1 US dollar = INR 74.132). A one-rupee investment in eVIN led to a return of INR 0.52 for traditional vaccines. The highest cost savings from eVIN was from better vaccine stock management. When same percentage of savings from the new vaccines were incorporated into the analysis, one-rupee investment in eVIN led to a return of INR 1.41. In the future, when only recurrent costs will exist, the return from eVIN will be even higher: a one-rupee investment in eVIN will yield a return of INR 2.93. The assessment of eVIN showed promising results in streamlining the vaccine flow network and ensuring equity in vaccine stock management along with good return on investment; hence, there was a rapid expansion of eVIN in all 731 districts across 36 states and union territories in the country.",

    "question": "Why is maintaining a healthy weight important?",
    "context": "30544190<SEP>Angeline Chatelan<SEP>Precision nutrition: hype or hope for public health interventions to reduce obesity?<SEP>High-income countries are experiencing an obesity epidemic that follows a socioeconomic gradient, affecting groups of lower socioeconomic status disproportionately. Recent clinical findings have suggested new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of obesity, using personalized dietary approaches. Precision nutrition (PN), also called personalized nutrition, has been developed to deliver more preventive and practical dietary advice than 'one-size-fits-all' guidelines. With interventions becoming increasingly plausible at a large scale thanks to artificial intelligence and smartphone applications, some have begun to view PN as a novel way to deliver the right dietary intervention to the right population. We argue that large-scale PN, if taken alone, might be of limited interest from a public health perspective. Building on Geoffrey Rose's theory regarding the differences in individual and population causes of disease, we show that large-scale PN can only address some individual causes of obesity (causes of cases). This individual-centred approach is likely to have a small impact on the distribution of obesity at a population level because it ignores the population causes of obesity (causes of incidence). The latter are embedded in the populations' social, cultural, economic and political contexts that make environments obesogenic. Additionally, the most socially privileged groups in the population are the most likely to respond to large-scale PN interventions. This could have the undesirable effect of widening social inequalities in obesity. We caution public health actors that interventions based only on large-scale PN are unlikely, despite current expectations, to improve dietary intake or reduce obesity at a population level.34008960<SEP>Juliane R Sempionatto<SEP>Wearable and Mobile Sensors for Personalized Nutrition<SEP>While wearable and mobile chemical sensors have experienced tremendous growth over the past decade, their potential for tracking and guiding nutrition has emerged only over the past three years. Currently, guidelines from doctors and dietitians represent the most common approach for maintaining optimal nutrition status. However, such recommendations rely on population averages and do not take into account individual variability in responding to nutrients. Precision nutrition has recently emerged to address the large heterogeneity in individuals' responses to diet, by tailoring nutrition based on the specific requirements of each person. It aims at preventing and managing diseases by formulating personalized dietary interventions to individuals on the basis of their metabolic profile, background, and environmental exposure. Recent advances in digital nutrition technology, including calories-counting mobile apps and wearable motion tracking devices, lack the ability of monitoring nutrition at the molecular level. The realization of effective precision nutrition requires synergy from different sensor modalities in order to make timely reliable predictions and efficient feedback. This work reviews key opportunities and challenges toward the successful realization of effective wearable and mobile nutrition monitoring platforms. Non-invasive wearable and mobile electrochemical sensors, capable of monitoring temporal chemical variations upon the intake of food and supplements, are excellent candidates to bridge the gap between digital and biochemical analyses for a successful personalized nutrition approach. By providing timely (previously unavailable) dietary information, such wearable and mobile sensors offer the guidance necessary for supporting dietary behavior change toward a managed nutritional balance. Coupling of the rapidly emerging wearable chemical sensing devices-generating enormous dynamic analytical data-with efficient data-fusion and data-mining methods that identify patterns and make predictions is expected to revolutionize dietary decision-making toward effective precision nutrition.35348398<SEP>Maria F Vasiloglou<SEP>Multimedia Data-Based Mobile Applications for Dietary Assessment<SEP>Diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity are chronic medical conditions associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Accurate macronutrient and energy estimation could be beneficial in attempts to manage DM and obesity, leading to improved glycemic control and weight reduction, respectively. Existing dietary assessment methods are subject to major errors in measurement, are time consuming, are costly, and do not provide real-time feedback. The increasing adoption of smartphones and artificial intelligence, along with the advances in algorithms and hardware, allowed the development of technologies executed in smartphones that use food/beverage multimedia data as an input, and output information about the nutrient content in almost real time. Scope of this review was to explore the various image-based and video-based systems designed for dietary assessment. We identified 22 different systems and divided these into three categories on the basis of their setting for evaluation: laboratory (12), preclinical (7), and clinical (3). The major findings of the review are that there is still a number of open research questions and technical challenges to be addressed and end users-including health care professionals and patients-need to be involved in the design and development of such innovative solutions. Last, there is a clear need that these systems should be validated under unconstrained real-life conditions and that they should be compared with conventional methods for dietary assessment.36118748<SEP>Silvia Berciano<SEP>Precision nutrition: Maintaining scientific integrity while realizing market potential<SEP>Precision Nutrition (PN) is an approach to developing comprehensive and dynamic nutritional recommendations based on individual variables, including genetics, microbiome, metabolic profile, health status, physical activity, dietary pattern, food environment as well as socioeconomic and psychosocial characteristics. PN can help answer the question \"What should I eat to be healthy?\", recognizing that what is healthful for one individual may not be the same for another, and understanding that health and responses to diet change over time. The growth of the PN market has been driven by increasing consumer interest in individualized products and services coupled with advances in technology, analytics, and omic sciences. However, important concerns are evident regarding the adequacy of scientific substantiation supporting claims for current products and services. An additional limitation to accessing PN is the current cost of diagnostic tests and wearable devices. Despite these challenges, PN holds great promise as a tool to improve healthspan and reduce healthcare costs. Accelerating advancement in PN will require: (a) investment in multidisciplinary collaborations to enable the development of user-friendly tools applying technological advances in omics, sensors, artificial intelligence, big data management, and analytics; (b) engagement of healthcare professionals and payers to support equitable and broader adoption of PN as medicine shifts toward preventive and personalized approaches; and (c) system-wide collaboration between stakeholders to advocate for continued support for evidence-based PN, develop a regulatory framework to maintain consumer trust and engagement, and allow PN to reach its full potential.",

    "context": "30419237<SEP>Dean E Schraufnagel<SEP>Air Pollution and Noncommunicable Diseases: A Review by the Forum of International Respiratory Societies' Environmental Committee, Part 2: Air Pollution and Organ Systems<SEP>Although air pollution is well known to be harmful to the lung and airways, it can also damage most other organ systems of the body. It is estimated that about 500,000 lung cancer deaths and 1.6 million COPD deaths can be attributed to air pollution, but air pollution may also account for 19% of all cardiovascular deaths and 21% of all stroke deaths. Air pollution has been linked to other malignancies, such as bladder cancer and childhood leukemia. Lung development in childhood is stymied with exposure to air pollutants, and poor lung development in children predicts lung impairment in adults. Air pollution is associated with reduced cognitive function and increased risk of dementia. Particulate matter in the air (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 \u03bcm) is associated with delayed psychomotor development and lower child intelligence. Studies link air pollution with diabetes mellitus prevalence, morbidity, and mortality. Pollution affects the immune system and is associated with allergic rhinitis, allergic sensitization, and autoimmunity. It is also associated with osteoporosis and bone fractures, conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, blepharitis, inflammatory bowel disease, increased intravascular coagulation, and decreased glomerular filtration rate. Atopic and urticarial skin disease, acne, and skin aging are linked to air pollution. Air pollution is controllable and, therefore, many of these adverse health effects can be prevented.36427724<SEP>Rhiannon Thompson<SEP>Air pollution and human cognition: A systematic review and meta-analysis<SEP>Background: This systematic review summarises and evaluates the literature investigating associations between exposure to air pollution and general population cognition, which has important implications for health, social and economic inequalities, and human productivity. Methods: The engines MEDLINE, Embase Classic+Embase, APA PsycInfo, and SCOPUS were searched up to May 2022. Our inclusion criteria focus on the following pollutants: particulate matter, NOx, and ozone. The cognitive abilities of interest are: general/global cognition, executive function, attention, working memory, learning, memory, intelligence and IQ, reasoning, reaction times, and processing speed. The collective evidence was assessed using the NTP-OHAT framework and random-effects meta-analyses. Results: Eighty-six studies were identified, the results of which were generally supportive of associations between exposures and worsened cognition, but the literature was varied and sometimes contradictory. There was moderate certainty support for detrimental associations between PM2.5 and general cognition in adults 40+, and PM2.5, NOx, and PM10 and executive function (especially working memory) in children. There was moderate certainty evidence against associations between ozone and general cognition in adults age 40+, and NOx and reasoning/IQ in children. Some associations were also supported by meta-analysis (N = 14 studies, all in adults aged 40+). A 1 \u03bcg/m3 increase in NO2 was associated with reduced performance on general cognitive batteries (\u03b2 = -0.02, p < 0.05) as was a 1 \u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure (\u03b2 = -0.02, p < 0.05). A 1\u03bcgm3 increase in PM2.5 was significantly associated with lower verbal fluency by -0.05 words (p = 0.01) and a decrease in executive function task performance of -0.02 points (p < 0.001). Discussion: Evidence was found in support of some exposure-outcome associations, however more good quality research is required, particularly with older teenagers and young adults (14-40 years), using multi-exposure modelling, incorporating mechanistic investigation, and in South America, Africa, South Asia and Australasia.35737514<SEP>Yu Ni<SEP>Associations of Pre- and Postnatal Air Pollution Exposures with Child Behavioral Problems and Cognitive Performance: A U.S. Multi-Cohort Study<SEP>Background: Population studies support the adverse associations of air pollution exposures with child behavioral functioning and cognitive performance, but few studies have used spatiotemporally resolved pollutant assessments. Objectives: We investigated these associations using more refined exposure assessments in 1,967 mother-child dyads from three U.S. pregnancy cohorts in six cities in the ECHO-PATHWAYS Consortium. Methods: Pre- and postnatal nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) \u22642.5\u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) exposures were derived from an advanced spatiotemporal model. Child behavior was reported as Total Problems raw score using the Child Behavior Checklist at age 4-6 y. Child cognition was assessed using cohort-specific cognitive performance scales and quantified as the Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ). We fitted multivariate linear regression models that were adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychological factors to estimate associations per 2-unit increase in pollutant in each exposure window and examined modification by child sex. Identified critical windows were further verified by distributed lag models (DLMs). Results: Mean NO2 and PM2.5 ranged from 8.4 to 9.0 ppb and 8.4 to 9.1 \u03bcg/m3, respectively, across pre- and postnatal windows. Average child Total Problems score and IQ were 22.7 [standard deviation (SD): 18.5] and 102.6 (SD: 15.3), respectively. Children with higher prenatal NO2 exposures were likely to have more behavioral problems [\u03b2: 1.24; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.39, 2.08; per 2 ppb NO2], particularly NO2 in the first and second trimester. Each 2-\u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5 at age 2-4 y was associated with a 3.59 unit (95% CI: 0.35, 6.84) higher Total Problems score and a 2.63 point (95% CI: -5.08, -0.17) lower IQ. The associations between PM2.5 and Total Problems score were generally stronger in girls. Most predefined windows identified were not confirmed by DLMs. Discussion: Our study extends earlier findings that have raised concerns about impaired behavioral functioning and cognitive performance in children exposed to NO2 and PM2.5 in utero and in early life. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10248.34292676<SEP>Ajay Vikram Singh<SEP>Emerging Technologies for In Vitro Inhalation Toxicology<SEP>Respiratory toxicology remains a major research area in the 21st century since current scenario of airborne viral infection transmission and pollutant inhalation is expected to raise the annual morbidity beyond 2 million.

    "context": "28274818<SEP>Nina Zisko<SEP>Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI), Sedentary Behavior and Cardiovascular Risk Factor Clustering - the HUNT Study<SEP>Prolonged sedentary behavior (SB) positively associates with clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The recently developed metric for physical activity (PA) tracking called Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) takes into account age, sex, resting and maximum heart rate, and a score of \u2265100 weekly PAI has been shown to reduce the risk of premature CVD death in healthy as well as individuals with known CVD risk factors, regardless of whether or not the current PA recommendations were met. The aim of the present study was to examine if PAI modifies the associations between SB and CVD risk factor (CV-RF) clustering in a large apparently healthy general population cohort (n=29,950, aged \u226520 years). Logistic regression revealed that in those with \u2265100 weekly PAI, the likelihood of CV-RF clustering prevalence associated with prolonged SB was attenuated across age groups. Monitoring weekly PAI-level could be useful to ensure that people perform enough PA to combat SB's deleterious association with CV-RF.30227185<SEP>Sophie K Kieffer<SEP>Temporal Changes in a Novel Metric of Physical Activity Tracking (Personal Activity Intelligence) and Mortality: The HUNT Study, Norway<SEP>Background: Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a novel activity metric that translates heart rate variations during exercise into a weekly score. Weekly PAI scores assessed at a single point in time were found to associate with lower risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the general healthy population. However, to date, the associations between long-term longitudinal changes in weekly PAI scores and mortality have not been explored. Purpose: The aim of the present study was to prospectively examine the association between change in weekly PAI scores estimated 10 years apart, and risk of mortality from CVD and all-causes. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of 11,870 men and 13,010 women without known CVD in Norway. By using data from the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT), PAI was estimated twice, ten years apart (HUNT1 1984-86 and HUNT2 1995-97). Mortality was followed-up until December 31, 2015. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for death from CVD and all-causes related to temporal changes in PAI were estimated using Cox regression analyses. Results: During a mean (SD) of 18 (4) years of follow-up, there were 4782 deaths, including 1560 deaths caused by CVD. Multi-adjusted analyses demonstrated that participants achieving a score of \u2265100 PAI at both time points had 32% lower risk of CVD mortality (AHR 0.68; CI: 0.54-0.86) for CVD mortality and 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality (AHR 0.80; CI: 71-0.91) compared with participants obtaining <100 weekly PAI at both measurements. For participants having <100 PAI in HUNT1 but \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2, the AHRs were 0.87 (CI: 0.74-1.03) for CVD mortality, and 0.86 (CI: 0.79-0.95) for all-cause mortality. We also found an inverse linear relationship between change in PAI and risk of CVD mortality among participants with 0 PAI (P < 0.01), and \u226450 PAI (P = 0.04) in HUNT1, indicating that an increase in PAI over time is associated with lower risk of mortality. Excluding the first three years of follow-up did not substantially alter the findings. Increasing PAI score from <100 PAI in HUNT1 to \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2 was associated with 6.6 years gained lifespan. Conclusion: Among men and women without known CVD, an increase in PAI score and sustained high PAI score over a 10-year period was associated with lower risk of mortality.30193673<SEP>Sophie K Kieffer<SEP>Personal Activity Intelligence and Mortality in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease: The HUNT Study<SEP>Objective: To test whether Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI), a personalized metric of physical activity (PA) tracking, is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in patients with self-reported CVD and to determine whether these associations change depending on whether contemporary PA recommendations are met. Patients and methods: A total of 3133 patients with CVD (mean [SD] age, 67.6 [10.3] years; 64% men) were followed from the date of participation in the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (between January 1, 1984, and February 28, 1986) until the date of death or the end of follow-up (December 31, 2015). The participants' weekly PAI score was calculated and divided into 4 groups (PAI scores of 0, \u226450, 51-99, and \u2265100). We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios for CVD and all-cause mortality rates. Results: After mean follow-up of 12.5 years (39,157 person-years), there were 2936 deaths (94%), including 1936 CVD deaths. Participants with weekly PAI scores of 100 or greater had 36% (95% CI, 21%-48%) and 24% (95% CI, 10%-35%) lower risk of mortality from CVD and all causes, respectively, compared with the inactive group. Participants had similar risk reductions associated with their weekly PAI scores regardless of following contemporary PA recommendations or not. Conclusion: Obtaining a weekly PAI score of at least 100 was associated with lower mortality risk from CVD and all causes in individuals with CVD regardless of whether the current PA recommendations were met.34629086<SEP>Amanda L Hannan<SEP>Effect of personal activity intelligence (PAI) monitoring in the maintenance phase of cardiac rehabilitation: a mixed methods evaluation<SEP>Background: Personal activity intelligence (PAI) is a single physical activity metric based upon heart rate responses to physical activity. Maintaining 100 PAI/week is associated with a 25% risk reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality and 50 PAI/week provides 60% of the benefits. The effect of utilising this metric within a cardiac population has not been previously investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of PAI monitoring on the amount and/or intensity of physical activity for people in the maintenance phase of cardiac rehabilitation and to explore participants' perceptions of this approach. Methods: A concurrent mixed methods approach was undertaken. Participants in the maintenance phase of cardiac rehabilitation monitored PAI for six weeks via a wearable physical activity monitoring device (WPAM). In the first three weeks participants were blinded to their PAI score. A quality-of-life questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) was completed, and semi-structured interviews conducted to investigate attitudes to PAI monitoring. Daily PAI data was collected throughout the 6-week period. Results: Twenty participants completed the trial. PAI earned/day was increased after participants could view their data (mean difference: 2.1 PAI/day (95% CI 0.3, 4.0), p = 0.027). The median change in percentage of days participants achieved a Total PAI score of 25 (p = 0.023) and 50 (p = 0.015) were also increased. The mean change in total scores for the EQ-5D-5L and EQVAS were improved after 6 weeks (0.6 \u00b1 1.05; 95% CI (0.11-1.09); p = 0.019); (5.8/100; 95% CI (2.4-9.2); p = 0.002 respectively). Thematic framework analysis identified three global themes (perceptions on the WPAM, PAI and factors affecting exercise). Most participants stated motivation to exercise increased after they could view their PAI data. Many of the participants believed they would continue to use PAI long-term. Others were undecided; the latter primarily due to technical issues and/or preferring devices with greater functionality and attractiveness. All participants would recommend PAI. Conclusion: This exploratory study showed monitoring PAI via a WPAM increased the amount and/or intensity of physical activity within the cardiac population. Participants found PAI interesting, beneficial, and motivating. If technical issues, aesthetics, and functionality of the WPAM were improved, participants may continue to use the approach long-term. PAI may be a viable strategy to assist people with cardiac disease maintain physical activity adherence.",

In addition, salinization jeopardizes agroecosystems, inducing salt stress in most cultivated plants (nutrient deficiency, pH and oxidative stress, biomass reduction), and directly affects the quality and quantity of food production. Depending on the type of salt/stress (alkaline or pH-neutral), specific approaches and solutions should be applied to ameliorate the situation on-site. Various agro-hydrotechnical (soil and water conservation, reduced tillage, mulching, rainwater harvesting, irrigation and drainage, control of seawater intrusion), biological (agroforestry, multi-cropping, cultivation of salt-resistant species, bacterial inoculation, promotion of mycorrhiza, grafting with salt-resistant rootstocks), chemical (application of organic and mineral amendments, phytohormones), bio-ecological (breeding, desalination, application of nano-based products, seed biopriming), and/or institutional solutions (salinity monitoring, integrated national and regional strategies) are very effective against salinity/salt stress and numerous other constraints. Advances in computer science (artificial intelligence, machine learning) provide rapid predictions of salinization processes from the field to the global scale, under numerous scenarios, including climate change.

In this study, CHLA, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), turbidity (TB), and Secchi depth (SD) collected by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the National Lakes Assessment in the continental USA were analyzed. Statistical analysis showed that water quality variables in natural lakes have strong patterns of autocorrelations than man-made lakes, indicating the perturbation of anthropogenic stresses on man-made lake ecosystems. Meanwhile, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) with fuzzy c-mean-clustering algorithm (ANFIS_FC), ANFIS with grid partition method (ANFIS_GP), and ANFIS with subtractive clustering method (ANFIS_SC) were implemented to model CHLA in lakes, and modeling results were compared with the multilayer perceptron neural network models (MLPNN). Results showed that ANFIS_FC models outperformed other models for natural lakes, while for man-made lakes, MLPNN models performed the best. ANFIS_GP models have the lowest accuracies in general. The results indicated that ANFIS models can be screening tools for an overall estimation of CHLA levels of lakes in large scales, especially for natural lakes.36557178<SEP>Nour AlSawaftah<SEP>A Review on Membrane Biofouling: Prediction, Characterization, and Mitigation<SEP>Water scarcity is an increasing problem on every continent, which instigated the search for novel ways to provide clean water suitable for human use; one such way is desalination. Desalination refers to the process of purifying salts and contaminants to produce water suitable for domestic and industrial applications. Due to the high costs and energy consumption associated with some desalination techniques, membrane-based technologies have emerged as a promising alternative water treatment, due to their high energy efficiency, operational simplicity, and lower cost. However, membrane fouling is a major challenge to membrane-based separation as it has detrimental effects on the membrane's performance and integrity. Based on the type of accumulated foulants, fouling can be classified into particulate, organic, inorganic, and biofouling. Biofouling is considered the most problematic among the four fouling categories. Therefore, proper characterization and prediction of biofouling are essential for creating efficient control and mitigation strategies to minimize the damage associated with biofouling. Moreover, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting membrane fouling has garnered a great deal of attention due to its adaptive capability and prediction accuracy. This paper presents an overview of the membrane biofouling mechanisms, characterization techniques, and predictive methods with a focus on AI-based techniques, and mitigation strategies.36642044<SEP>Paul Delano\u00eb<SEP>Method and evaluations of the effective gain of artificial intelligence models for reducing CO2 emissions<SEP>Nowadays, there is an increasing use of digital technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as Machine Learning (ML) models that leverage data to optimize the performances of systems in almost all activity sectors, including ML models for optimizing solutions related to CO2 capture from the atmosphere or CO2 emissions reduction from human activities. However, on the other hand, the use of AI models is leading to an increasing energy consumption that also raises environmental issues (in terms of CO2 emissions) which are less studied in the literature. This then raises the new question of a more realistic estimate of the carbon footprint (CO2 emissions in particular) of AI models in general, and particularly AI models aimed at reducing CO2 emissions. Thus, in this paper, for an AI model in this latter context, we propose a method to quantify both his negative impacts (quantity of CO2 emissions emitted by the training and use of the model) and his positive impacts (quantity of CO2 emissions saved when the model is used). The method is evaluated with three state-of-the-art AI models: (i) an artificial neural network model for managing the energy demand of Brazilian households, (ii) an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system for photovoltaic power forecast in Tunisia, (iii) and a Bayesian regression model for the electric vehicle routing problem in Sweden and Luxembourg. Results show that, if only the positive impacts are considered, the reduction of CO2 emitted due to the usage of the models is significant, but depends on each context (34%, 73%, and 9%, respectively). However, when both positive and negative impacts are considered, the negative impacts are sometimes higher than the positive impacts (the first and the third model) for a nominal use (1 user). Nevertheless, the balance becomes highly positive again, when these two projects are scaled up (realistic projections with many users). The second model cannot be scaled up, but the balance remains positive, even if the gains are much smaller. More generally, the CO2 emissions gain metrics provided by our method can be used as new metrics for comparing the efficiency of AI models (for reducing CO2 emissions) beyond predictive capacity-based traditional ML evaluation metrics. Based on the lessons learned from our study, we also provide seven global recommendations that can contribute to the reduction of the carbon footprint of ML models in general.",
    "answer": "Adequate hydration is important because it plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and functionality of various physiological processes in the body. Water is essential for regulating body temperature, transporting nutrients and oxygen to cells, removing waste and toxins, lubricating joints, and supporting overall organ function. In the context of environmental issues such as salinization, water conservation and management strategies are crucial for sustaining plant growth and agricultural productivity. Insufficient hydration can lead to dehydration, which can negatively impact physical and cognitive performance, as well as overall health. Therefore, staying adequately hydrated is essential for supporting the body's functions and promoting well-being.",

    "question": "How does stress influence mental health?",
    "context": "35867483<SEP>Laura Lacomba-Trejo<SEP>Analysis of predictors of stress during confinement by COVID-19 in Spain<SEP>Confinement has had a great emotional impact on the population, especially in terms of stress. Factors such as the presence of previous mental or physical illness, resilience or emotional intelligence may influence the occurrence or increase of stress. The aim was to assess predictors of stress by comparing two statistical methodologies (one linear and one non-linear).36348818<SEP>Tiziana Lanciano<SEP>The Psychological Effects of Imprisonment: The Role of Cognitive, Psychopathic and Affective Traits<SEP>The present cross-sectional correlational study aimed to investigate a set of cognitive, affective, and personality traits impacting the psychological effects of imprisonment. Ninety-three male inmates filled out a battery including measures of intelligence, working memory, psychopathy, aggressiveness, anxious trait, emotionality, rumination styles, and empathy proneness. Inmates' psychological outcomes were conceptualized in terms of mood, anxiety, depression, and general health. Results showed that inmates with high cognitive abilities, psychopathic impulsivity, proactive aggression, personal distress and fantasy, anxious and negative emotionality are mainly prone to ill-being psychological outcomes. Contrariwise, the fearless dominance trait, positive emotionality and empathic concern ability seem to expose inmates to positive psychological outcomes. Reactive aggression and perspective taking seem to impact both positive and negative moods. Ruminative style was unrelated to psychological outcomes. These preliminary results provide an insight into which factors intervention programs should be based upon in order to enhance well-being and reduce distress among inmates.36540668<SEP>Elena Bermejo-Martins<SEP>The role of emotional intelligence and self-care in the stress perception during COVID-19 outbreak: An intercultural moderated mediation analysis<SEP>Background: The relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and stress has been widely studied, as well as the beneficial role of self-care to maintain health and wellbeing. However, the joint contribution of EI and self-care in predicting stress has not been examined during COVID-19 lockdown. This study aimed to examine the mediating role of self-care in the relationship between EI and stress and the potential moderator role of gender. Methods: A sample of 1082 participants from four Hispanic countries completed measures related to socio-demographic, trait emotional intelligence (Trait Meta-Mood Scale), self-care activities (Self-care Activities Screening Scale) and stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Results: Mediation analyses revealed that self-care increased the explained variance of the prediction of stress by EI dimensions after controlling gender and age. However, gender only moderated the relationship between self-care and stress in the mediation model corresponding to emotional attention. Conclusions: Data supported a general model for the interaction of EI and self-care as contributing factors of stress. Further research is needed to replicate it in more culturally distant samples and to fully explore the potential role of gender differences. Future intervention programs should include a balanced combination of EI and self-care to increase their benefits on people's health.37360879<SEP>Iraida Delhom<SEP>Prediction of psychopathology during the COVID-19 pandemic using linear and non-linear methodologies: importance of COVID-19 threat perception, emotional competencies and resilience<SEP>The presence of a mental or physical illness prior to the pandemic, the perceived threat from COVID-19, resilience or emotional intelligence may influence the onset or increase of psychopathology during the COVID-19 lockdown. The aim was to assess predictors of psychopathology by comparing two statistical methodologies (one linear and one non-linear). Method: A total of 802 Spanish participants (65.50% female) completed the questionnaires independently after signing informed consent. Psychopathology, perceived threat, resilience and emotional intelligence were assessed. Descriptive statistics, hierarchical regression models (HRM) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) were conducted. Results: The data obtained through the HRM showed that the presence of a previous mental illness, low resilience and emotional clarity, high emotional attention and repair, and COVID-19 threat perception predicted 51% of the variance in psychopathology. Results obtained from QCA showed that different combinations of these variables explained 37% of high levels of psychopathology and 86% of low levels of psychopathology, highlighting how the presence of prior mental illness, high emotional clarity, high resilience, low emotional attention and low perceived COVID-19 threat play a key role in explaining psychopathology. Conclusions: These aspects will help promote personal resources to buffer psychopathology in lockdown situations.",
    "answer": "Stress can significantly influence mental health, especially during challenging situations like the COVID-19 lockdown. Various factors such as previous mental or physical illness, resilience, emotional intelligence, and emotional clarity can play a crucial role in determining the level of stress experienced by individuals. For example, individuals with high cognitive abilities, psychopathic impulsivity, proactive aggression, personal distress, and negative emotionality may be more prone to experiencing psychological distress. On the other hand, traits such as fearless dominance, positive emotionality, and empathic concern may contribute to positive psychological outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, the presence of prior mental illness, low resilience, high emotional attention and repair, and perceived threat from COVID-19 have been identified as predictors of psychopathology during the pandemic. These factors contribute to a significant variance in psychopathology levels. It is essential to consider a balanced combination of emotional intelligence and self-care activities to reduce stress levels and promote well-being, particularly in challenging situations like the COVID-19 lockdown. Promoting personal resources and interventions based on these factors can help mitigate the negative impact of stress on mental health during confinement.",

    "context": "33988545<SEP>Junyeon Won<SEP>Cardiovascular Endurance Modifies the Link between Subjective Sleep Quality and Entorhinal Cortex Thickness in Younger Adults<SEP>Introduction: Poor sleep is linked to impaired cognitive function, cortical brain atrophy, and lower cortical thickness. Independently, higher cardiovascular endurance has neuroprotective effects. It remains in question, however, whether cardiovascular endurance moderates the relationship between sleep and brain health. The aims of this study included the following: 1) the association between subjective sleep quality and cognitive performance, hippocampus volume, and entorhinal cortex (EC) thickness, and 2) the moderating effects of cardiovascular endurance on the associations of sleep quality with cognitive and magnetic resonance imaging measures in healthy younger adults. Methods: A total of 1095 younger adults (28.8 \u00b1 3.6 yr) from the Human Connectome Project were included in the analyses. The 2-min walk test was used as a proxy of cardiovascular endurance. Self-reported sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Composite cognitive tests were used to assess global cognition, and T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging data (obtained using Siemens 3T scanner) was used to assess hippocampus volume and EC thickness. Linear regression was used to examine the moderating effects of fitness on the relationships between sleep and each of these neurocognitive outcomes after controlling for age, sex, and education year. Results: Poorer sleep quality was associated with both a lower crystalized intelligence score (B = -0.198, P = 0.034) and lower EC thickness (B = -0.013, P = 0.003). With greater 2-min walk test score, the association between greater Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score and lower EC thickness was attenuated (B = 0.0008, P = 0.028). Conclusions: Higher cardiovascular endurance may mitigate the relationship between poorer subjective sleep quality and lower EC thickness. Future longitudinal studies should examine the interactive effects of sleep and fitness on brain health among older and more vulnerable populations.30252185<SEP>Michael Hahn<SEP>Developmental changes of sleep spindles and their impact on sleep-dependent memory consolidation and general cognitive abilities: A longitudinal approach<SEP>Sleep spindles are related to sleep-dependent memory consolidation and general cognitive abilities. However, they undergo drastic maturational changes during adolescence. Here we used a longitudinal approach (across 7 years) to explore whether developmental changes in sleep spindle density can explain individual differences in sleep-dependent memory consolidation and general cognitive abilities. Ambulatory polysomnography was recorded during four nights in 34 healthy subjects (24 female) with two nights (baseline and experimental) at initial recording (age range 8-11 years) and two nights at follow-up recording (age range 14-18 years). For declarative learning, participants encoded word pairs with a subsequent recall before and after sleep. General cognitive abilities were measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale. Higher slow (11-13 Hz) than fast (13-15 Hz) spindle density at frontal, central, and parietal sites during initial recordings, followed by a shift to higher fast than slow spindle density at central and parietal sites during follow-up recordings, suggest that mature spindle topography develops throughout adolescence. Fast spindle density increases from baseline to experimental night were positively related to sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In addition, we found that the development of fast spindles predicted the improvement in memory consolidation across the two longitudinal measurements, a finding that underlines a crucial role for mature fast spindles for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Furthermore, slow spindle changes across adolescence were related to general cognitive abilities, a relationship that could indicate the maturation of frontal networks relevant for efficient cognitive processing.

Design: Correlational. Intelligence (Stanford-Binet) and neurocognitive functioning (NEPSY) were assessed, with sleep variables being measured during overnight polysomnography. Setting: Hospital sleep laboratory. Participants: Twenty-seven healthy children (mean age 8.19 y; 14 female, 13 male). Interventions: N/A. Measurements and results: Participants underwent a single night of overnight polysomnography after completing measures of intelligence and neurocognitive functioning. Sleep spindles were visually identified by an experienced sleep scoring technician and separated algorithmically into fast (> 13 Hz) and slow spindle (< 13 Hz) categories. The number of fast spindles was significantly correlated with narrative memory (r(s) = 0.38) and sensorimotor functioning (-0.43). Mean central frequency of spindles was also significantly correlated with sensorimotor functioning (-0.41), planning ability (-0.41), and working memory (-0.54). Conclusions: Basal sleep spindle activity is associated with different aspects of cognitive performance in children. To the extent that these associations in a pediatric population are different from what is known in adult sleep may play an important role in development.38114167<SEP>Dan Yang<SEP>[Molecular mechanism of sleep deprivation-induced body injury and traditional Chinese medicine prevention and treatment: a review]<SEP>Sleep occupies one-third of a person's lifetime and is a necessary condition for maintaining physiological function and health. With the increase in social and economic pressures, the growing use of electronic devices and the accelerated aging process of the population, insufficient sleep and its hazards have drawn widespread attention from researchers in China and abroad. Sleep deprivation refers to a decrease in sleep or a severe lack of sleep due to various reasons. Previous studies have found that sleep deprivation can cause extensive damage to the body, including an increased incidence and mortality rate of neuropathic diseases in the brain, cardiovascular diseases, imbalances in the gut microbiota, and other multi-organ diseases. The mechanisms underlying the occurrence of multi-system and multi-organ diseases due to sleep deprivation mainly involve oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, and impaired immune function in the body. According to traditional Chinese medicine(TCM), sleep deprivation falls into the category of sleepiness, and long-term sleepiness leads to Yin-Yang imbalance, resulting in the consumption of Qi and damage to the five Zang-organs. The appropriate treatment should focus on tonifying deficiency, reinforcing healthy Qi, and harmonizing Yin and Yang. TCM is characterized by a wide variety and abundant resources, and it has minimal side effects and a broad range of applications. Numerous studies have shown that TCM drugs and prescriptions not only improve sleep but also have beneficial effects on liver nourishment, intelligence enhancement, and kidney tonification, effectively preventing and treating the body injury caused by sleep deprivation. Given the increasing prevalence of sleep deprivation and its significant impact on body health, this article reviewed sleep deprivation-mediated body injury and its mechanism, summarized and categorized TCM compound prescriptions and single drugs for preventing and treating body injury, with the aim of laying the foundation for researchers to develop effective drugs for preventing and treating body injury caused by sleep deprivation and providing references for further exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying the body injury caused by sleep deprivation.",
    "answer": "Sleep is crucial for health for several reasons. One important aspect is its impact on brain health and cognitive function. Poor sleep quality has been linked to impaired cognitive function, cortical brain atrophy, and lower cortical thickness. In younger adults, subjective sleep quality was associated with lower entorhinal cortex thickness, which plays a role in memory and navigation. This suggests that sleep quality can directly affect brain health and cognitive performance.\n\nAdditionally, sleep is important for memory consolidation. Sleep spindles, which are related to memory consolidation, undergo significant changes during adolescence. Fast spindle density has been found to be positively related to sleep-dependent memory consolidation. The development of fast spindles throughout adolescence plays a crucial role in memory consolidation and overall cognitive abilities. \n\nFurthermore, sleep deprivation can lead to extensive damage to the body, including increased incidence of neurological diseases, cardiovascular issues, gut microbiota imbalances, and impaired immune function. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) recognizes the importance of sleep for maintaining Yin-Yang balance and overall health. TCM treatment focuses on tonifying deficiencies, reinforcing healthy Qi, and harmonizing Yin and Yang to prevent and treat body injury caused by sleep deprivation. TCM drugs and prescriptions have been shown to improve sleep quality, enhance cognitive function, and nourish various organs, providing a holistic approach to addressing the impact of sleep deprivation on health. \n\nIn conclusion, sleep is essential for maintaining overall health, cognitive function, and preventing body injuries caused by sleep deprivation. Incorporating good sleep hygiene practices and considering interventions such as TCM can help promote better health outcomes and improve overall well-being.",

    "question": "What are the effects of excessive alcohol consumption on the liver?",
    "context": "36407766<SEP>Laura B Ferguson<SEP>RNA biomarkers for alcohol use disorder<SEP>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent and one of the leading causes of disability in the US and around the world. There are some molecular biomarkers of heavy alcohol use and liver damage which can suggest AUD, but these are lacking in sensitivity and specificity. AUD treatment involves psychosocial interventions and medications for managing alcohol withdrawal, assisting in abstinence and reduced drinking (naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram, and some off-label medications), and treating comorbid psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression and anxiety). It has been suggested that various patient groups within the heterogeneous AUD population would respond more favorably to specific treatment approaches. For example, there is some evidence that so-called reward-drinkers respond better to naltrexone than acamprosate. However, there are currently no objective molecular markers to separate patients into optimal treatment groups or any markers of treatment response. Objective molecular biomarkers could aid in AUD diagnosis and patient stratification, which could personalize treatment and improve outcomes through more targeted interventions. Biomarkers of treatment response could also improve AUD management and treatment development. Systems biology considers complex diseases and emergent behaviors as the outcome of interactions and crosstalk between biomolecular networks. A systems approach that uses transcriptomic (or other -omic data, e.g., methylome, proteome, metabolome) can capture genetic and environmental factors associated with AUD and potentially provide sensitive, specific, and objective biomarkers to guide patient stratification, prognosis of treatment response or relapse, and predict optimal treatments. This Review describes and highlights state-of-the-art research on employing transcriptomic data and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to serve as molecular biomarkers with the goal of improving the clinical management of AUD. Considerations about future directions are also discussed.37408098<SEP>William T Branagan<SEP>Assessment and Evaluation of Alcohol Use Disorder in Liver Transplant<SEP>Alcohol-related liver disease is the most common indication for liver transplantation. It is essential for providers in transplantation to be informed of the state of the science in evaluation of alcohol use disorder (AUD). This review examines the broad range of approaches to the evaluation of AUD ranging from traditional interview approaches to recent literature on artificial intelligence models. The empirical support for methods of evaluation is examined. The authors discuss the use of each method in the context of patients seeking a liver transplant for alcohol-related liver disease. This review emphasizes the importance of using objective assessments so that transplant centers make evidence-based decisions and reduce cognitive bias. The review concludes with a proposed assessment battery for evaluation and bridges to future directions in the field of AUD assessment in liver transplantation.31209850<SEP>Nicholas J Schork<SEP>Artificial Intelligence and Personalized Medicine<SEP>The development of high-throughput, data-intensive biomedical research assays and technologies has created a need for researchers to develop strategies for analyzing, integrating, and interpreting the massive amounts of data they generate. Although a wide variety of statistical methods have been designed to accommodate 'big data,' experiences with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques suggest that they might be particularly appropriate. In addition, the results of the application of these assays reveal a great heterogeneity in the pathophysiologic factors and processes that contribute to disease, suggesting that there is a need to tailor, or 'personalize,' medicines to the nuanced and often unique features possessed by individual patients. Given how important data-intensive assays are to revealing appropriate intervention targets and strategies for treating an individual with a disease, AI can play an important role in the development of personalized medicines. We describe many areas where AI can play such a role and argue that AI's ability to advance personalized medicine will depend critically on not only the refinement of relevant assays, but also on ways of storing, aggregating, accessing, and ultimately integrating, the data they produce. We also point out the limitations of many AI techniques in developing personalized medicines as well as consider areas for further research.38113073<SEP>Philipp A Toussaint<SEP>Explainable artificial intelligence for omics data: a systematic mapping study<SEP>Researchers increasingly turn to explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to analyze omics data and gain insights into the underlying biological processes. Yet, given the interdisciplinary nature of the field, many findings have only been shared in their respective research community. An overview of XAI for omics data is needed to highlight promising approaches and help detect common issues. Toward this end, we conducted a systematic mapping study. To identify relevant literature, we queried Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, BioRxiv, MedRxiv and arXiv. Based on keywording, we developed a coding scheme with 10 facets regarding the studies' AI methods, explainability methods and omics data. Our mapping study resulted in 405 included papers published between 2010 and 2023. The inspected papers analyze DNA-based (mostly genomic), transcriptomic, proteomic or metabolomic data by means of neural networks, tree-based methods, statistical methods and further AI methods. The preferred post-hoc explainability methods are feature relevance (n = 166) and visual explanation (n = 52), while papers using interpretable approaches often resort to the use of transparent models (n = 83) or architecture modifications (n = 72). With many research gaps still apparent for XAI for omics data, we deduced eight research directions and discuss their potential for the field. We also provide exemplary research questions for each direction. Many problems with the adoption of XAI for omics data in clinical practice are yet to be resolved. This systematic mapping study outlines extant research on the topic and provides research directions for researchers and practitioners.",
    "answer": "Excessive alcohol consumption can have severe effects on the liver, leading to conditions like alcohol-related liver disease (ALD). ALD is a common cause for liver transplantation and can be a major concern for individuals with AUD. It is crucial for healthcare providers to accurately evaluate AUD in patients, especially those seeking liver transplants due to ALD. Assessing AUD using objective methods, such as artificial intelligence models, can help transplant centers make evidence-based decisions and reduce bias in evaluating patients. By incorporating AI techniques, providers can better understand the complex factors contributing to AUD and tailor treatments more effectively for individual patients. Utilizing high-throughput data and AI in personalized medicine can lead to improved clinical outcomes by guiding patient stratification, treatment response prediction, and relapse prevention in the management of AUD. Overall, the integration of AI in the evaluation and management of AUD holds promise for enhancing clinical practices and improving patient outcomes.",

    "context": "33966519<SEP>Mark V Pezzo<SEP>Effect of Having, but Not Consulting, a Computerized Diagnostic Aid<SEP>Previous research has described physicians' reluctance to use computerized diagnostic aids (CDAs) but has never experimentally examined the effects of not consulting an aid that was readily available. Experiment 1. Participants read about a diagnosis made either by a physician or an auto mechanic (to control for perceived expertise). Half read that a CDA was available but never actually consulted; no mention of a CDA was made for the remaining half. For the physician, failure to consult the CDA had no significant effect on competence ratings for either the positive or negative outcome. For the auto mechanic, failure to consult the CDA actually increased competence ratings following a negative but not a positive outcome. Negligence judgments were greater for the mechanic than for the physician overall. Experiment 2. Using only a negative outcome, we included 2 different reasons for not consulting the aid and provided accuracy information highlighting the superiority of the CDA over the physician. In neither condition was the physician rated lower than when no aid was mentioned. Ratings were lower when the physician did not trust the CDA and, surprisingly, higher when the physician believed he or she already knew what the CDA would say. Finally, consistent with our previous research, ratings were also high when the physician consulted and then followed the advice of a CDA and low when the CDA was consulted but ignored. Individual differences in numeracy did not qualify these results. Implications for the literature on algorithm aversion and clinical practice are discussed.38332598<SEP>Paul Nolan<SEP>Artificial Intelligence in Medicine: Issues When Determining Negligence<SEP>The introduction of novel medical technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), into traditional clinical practice presents legal liability challenges that need to be squarely addressed by litigants and courts when something goes wrong. Some of the most promising applications for the use of AI in medicine will lead to vexed liability questions. As AI in health care is in its relative infancy, there is a paucity of case law globally upon which to draw. This article analyses medical malpractice where AI is involved, what problems arise when applying the tort of negligence - such as establishing the essential elements of breach of duty of care and causation - and how can these can be addressed. Product liability under Australian Consumer Law is beyond the scope of this article. In order to address this question, the article: (1) identifies the general problems that black box AI causes in the health care sector; (2) identifies the problems that will arise in establishing breach and causation due to the \"black box\" nature of AI, with reference to the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) and common law through two hypothetical examples; and (3) considers selected legal solutions to the problems caused by \"black box\" AI.35842722<SEP>Wim Van Biesen<SEP>An exploration of expectations and perceptions of practicing physicians on the implementation of computerized clinical decision support systems using a Qsort approach<SEP>Background: There is increasing interest in incorporating clinical decision support (CDS) into electronic healthcare records (EHR). Successful implementation of CDS systems depends on acceptance of them by healthcare workers. We used a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods starting from Qsort methodology to explore expectations and perceptions of practicing physicians on the use of CDS incorporated in EHR. Methods: The study was performed in a large tertiary care academic hospital. We used a mixed approach with a Q-sort based classification of pre-defined reactions to clinical case vignettes combined with a thinking-aloud approach, taking into account COREQ recommendations The open source software of Ken-Q Analysis version 1.0.6. was used for the quantitative analysis, using principal components and a Varimax rotation. For the qualitative analysis, a thematic analysis based on the four main themes was performed based on the audiotapes and field notes. Results: Thirty physicians were interviewed (7 in training, 8 junior staff and 15 senior staff; 16 females). Nearly all respondents were strongly averse towards interruptive messages, especially when these also were obstructive. Obstructive interruption was considered to be acceptable only when it increases safety, is adjustable to user expertise level and/or allows deviations when the end-user explains why a deviation is desirable in the case at issue. Transparency was deemed an essential feature, which seems to boil down to providing sufficient clarification on the factors underlying the recommendations of the CDS, so that these can be compared against the physicians' existing knowledge, beliefs and convictions. Conclusion: Avoidance of disruptive workflows and transparency of the underlying decision processes are important points to consider when developing CDS systems incorporated in EHR.34183345<SEP>Viknesh Sounderajah<SEP>Developing a reporting guideline for artificial intelligence-centred diagnostic test accuracy studies: the STARD-AI protocol<SEP>Introduction: Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Study (STARD) was developed to improve the completeness and transparency of reporting in studies investigating diagnostic test accuracy. However, its current form, STARD 2015 does not address the issues and challenges raised by artificial intelligence (AI)-centred interventions. As such, we propose an AI-specific version of the STARD checklist (STARD-AI), which focuses on the reporting of AI diagnostic test accuracy studies. This paper describes the methods that will be used to develop STARD-AI. Methods and analysis: The development of the STARD-AI checklist can be distilled into six stages. (1) A project organisation phase has been undertaken, during which a Project Team and a Steering Committee were established; (2) An item generation process has been completed following a literature review, a patient and public involvement and engagement exercise and an online scoping survey of international experts; (3) A three-round modified Delphi consensus methodology is underway, which will culminate in a teleconference consensus meeting of experts; (4) Thereafter, the Project Team will draft the initial STARD-AI checklist and the accompanying documents; (5) A piloting phase among expert users will be undertaken to identify items which are either unclear or missing. This process, consisting of surveys and semistructured interviews, will contribute towards the explanation and elaboration document and (6) On finalisation of the manuscripts, the group's efforts turn towards an organised dissemination and implementation strategy to maximise end-user adoption. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval has been granted by the Joint Research Compliance Office at Imperial College London (reference number: 19IC5679). A dissemination strategy will be aimed towards five groups of stakeholders: (1) academia, (2) policy, (3) guidelines and regulation, (4) industry and (5) public and non-specific stakeholders.

    "context": "32962608<SEP>Dongsheng Hong<SEP>Improvement in Hypertension Management with Pharmacological and Non- Pharmacological Approaches: Current Perspectives<SEP>Purpose: Improving hypertension management is still one of the biggest challenges in public health worldwide. Existing guidelines do not reach a consensus on the optimal Blood Pressure (BP) target. Therefore, how to effectively manage hypertension based on individual characteristics of patients, combined with the pharmacological and non-pharmacological approach, has become a problem to be urgently considered. Methods: Reports published in PubMed that covered Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Approaches in subjects taking hypertension management were reviewed by the group independently and collectively. Practical recommendations for hypertension management were established by the panel. Results: Pharmacological mechanism, action characteristics, and main adverse reactions varied across different pharmacological agents, and patients with hypertension often require a combination of antihypertensive medications to achieve the target BP range. Non-pharmacological treatment provides an additional effective method for improving therapy adherence and long-term BP control, thus reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and slowing down the progression of the disease. Conclusion: This review summarizes the available literature on the most convincing guideline principles, pharmacological treatment, biotechnology interference, interventional surgical treatment, managing hypertension with technical means of big data, Artificial Intelligence and Behavioral Intervention, as well as providing future directions, for facilitating Current and Developing knowledge into clinical implementation.30172038<SEP>Stephen D Persell<SEP>Design of a randomized controlled trial comparing a mobile phone-based hypertension health coaching application to home blood pressure monitoring alone: The Smart Hypertension Control Study<SEP>Background: Hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality but frequently remains uncontrolled. A smartphone application that provides coaching regarding home blood pressure monitoring and other aspects of hypertension self-care and related behavior change may be a scalable way to help manage hypertension. Methods/design: The Smart Hypertension Control Study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a hypertension personal control program (HPCP), which consists of an automated artificial intelligence smartphone application that provides individualized support and coaching to promote home monitoring and healthy behavior changes related to hypertension self-management. Enrolled adults with uncontrolled hypertension will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the HPCP with home blood pressure monitoring or to home monitoring alone. We plan to enroll 350 participants, with a target of 300 participants with complete six-month follow-up data. The primary study outcome will be systolic blood pressure at six months. Additional outcomes include measures of antihypertensive medication adherence, home blood pressure monitoring practices, self-management practices, weight, and self-reported health behaviors. Conclusion: The Smart Hypertension Control Study will evaluate blood pressure and hypertension self-management behavior outcomes in participants with uncontrolled hypertension exposed to a smartphone-based hypertension health coaching application in addition to home blood pressure monitoring compared to those exposed to home blood pressure monitoring alone.35860431<SEP>Qiliang Song<SEP>Provisional Decision-Making for Perioperative Blood Pressure Management: A Narrative Review<SEP>Blood pressure (BP) is a basic determinant for organ blood flow supply. Insufficient blood supply will cause tissue hypoxia, provoke cellular oxidative stress, and to some extent lead to organ injury. Perioperative BP is labile and dynamic, and intraoperative hypotension is common. It is unclear whether there is a causal relationship between intraoperative hypotension and organ injury. However, hypotension surely compromises perfusion and causes harm to some extent. Because the harm threshold remains unknown, various guidelines for intraoperative BP management have been proposed. With the pending definitions from robust randomized trials, it is reasonable to consider observational analyses suggesting that mean arterial pressures below 65 mmHg sustained for more than 15 minutes are associated with myocardial and renal injury. Advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence may facilitate the management of hemodynamics globally, including fluid administration, rather than BP alone. The previous mounting studies concentrated on associations between BP targets and adverse complications, whereas few studies were concerned about how to treat and multiple factors for decision-making. Hence, in this narrative review, we discussed the way of BP measurement and current knowledge about baseline BP extracting for surgical patients, highlighted the decision-making process for BP management with a view to providing pragmatic guidance for BP treatment in the clinical settings, and evaluated the merits of an automated blood control system in predicting hypotension.37119074<SEP>Clea du Toit<SEP>Survey and Evaluation of Hypertension Machine Learning Research<SEP>Background Machine learning (ML) is pervasive in all fields of research, from automating tasks to complex decision-making. However, applications in different specialities are variable and generally limited. Like other conditions, the number of studies employing ML in hypertension research is growing rapidly. In this study, we aimed to survey hypertension research using ML, evaluate the reporting quality, and identify barriers to ML's potential to transform hypertension care. Methods and Results The Harmonious Understanding of Machine Learning Analytics Network survey questionnaire was applied to 63 hypertension-related ML research articles published between January 2019 and September 2021. The most common research topics were blood pressure prediction (38%), hypertension (22%), cardiovascular outcomes (6%), blood pressure variability (5%), treatment response (5%), and real-time blood pressure estimation (5%). The reporting quality of the articles was variable. Only 46% of articles described the study population or derivation cohort. Most articles (81%) reported at least 1 performance measure, but only 40% presented any measures of calibration. Compliance with ethics, patient privacy, and data security regulations were mentioned in 30 (48%) of the articles. Only 14% used geographically or temporally distinct validation data sets. Algorithmic bias was not addressed in any of the articles, with only 6 of them acknowledging risk of bias. Conclusions Recent ML research on hypertension is limited to exploratory research and has significant shortcomings in reporting quality, model validation, and algorithmic bias. Our analysis identifies areas for improvement that will help pave the way for the realization of the potential of ML in hypertension and facilitate its adoption.",
    "answer": "Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, can have a significant impact on cardiac health. When blood pressure is elevated, it can put strain on the heart as it has to work harder to pump blood throughout the body. This increased workload over time can lead to various heart conditions, such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias.\n\nManaging hypertension is crucial to maintaining overall cardiac health. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches play a vital role in controlling blood pressure levels. Pharmacologically, different medications may be needed to achieve the target blood pressure range, as the mechanism, action characteristics, and adverse reactions vary among antihypertensive agents. Non-pharmacological treatments, like lifestyle modifications and behavioral interventions, can also be effective in improving therapy adherence and long-term blood pressure control. These interventions can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and slow down the progression of hypertension-related complications.\n\nIn conclusion, effectively managing hypertension through a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches is essential for maintaining cardiac health and reducing the risks associated with high blood pressure. By focusing on individual patient characteristics and utilizing the latest technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, advancements can be made in hypertension management to improve clinical outcomes and overall patient well-being.",

The recently developed metric for physical activity (PA) tracking called Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) takes into account age, sex, resting and maximum heart rate, and a score of \u2265100 weekly PAI has been shown to reduce the risk of premature CVD death in healthy as well as individuals with known CVD risk factors, regardless of whether or not the current PA recommendations were met. The aim of the present study was to examine if PAI modifies the associations between SB and CVD risk factor (CV-RF) clustering in a large apparently healthy general population cohort (n=29,950, aged \u226520 years). Logistic regression revealed that in those with \u2265100 weekly PAI, the likelihood of CV-RF clustering prevalence associated with prolonged SB was attenuated across age groups. Monitoring weekly PAI-level could be useful to ensure that people perform enough PA to combat SB's deleterious association with CV-RF.27984009<SEP>Bjarne M Nes<SEP>Personalized Activity Intelligence (PAI) for Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease and Promotion of Physical Activity<SEP>Purpose: To derive and validate a single metric of activity tracking that associates with lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. Methods: We derived an algorithm, Personalized Activity Intelligence (PAI), using the HUNT Fitness Study (n = 4631), and validated it in the general HUNT population (n = 39,298) aged 20-74 years. The PAI was divided into three sex-specific groups (\u226450, 51-99, and \u2265100), and the inactive group (0 PAI) was used as the referent. Hazard ratios for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regressions. Results: After >1 million person-years of observations during a mean follow-up time of 26.2 (SD 5.9) years, there were 10,062 deaths, including 3867 deaths (2207 men and 1660 women) from cardiovascular disease. Men and women with a PAI level \u2265100 had 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7%-27%) and 23% (95% CI, 4%-38%) reduced risk of cardiovascular disease mortality, respectively, compared with the inactive groups. Obtaining \u2265100 PAI was associated with significantly lower risk for cardiovascular disease mortality in all prespecified age groups, and in participants with known cardiovascular disease risk factors (all P-trends <.01). Participants who did not obtain \u2265100 PAI had increased risk of dying regardless of meeting the physical activity recommendations. Conclusion: PAI may have a huge potential to motivate people to become and stay physically active, as it is an easily understandable and scientifically proven metric that could inform potential users of how much physical activity is needed to reduce the risk of premature cardiovascular disease death.34865822<SEP>Javaid Nauman<SEP>Association Between Personal Activity Intelligence and Mortality: Population-Based China Kadoorie Biobank Study<SEP>Objective: To prospectively investigate the association between personal activity intelligence (PAI) - a novel metabolic metric which translates heart rate during physical activity into a simple weekly score - and mortality in relatively healthy participants in China whose levels and patterns of physical activity in addition to other lifestyle factors are different from those in high-income countries. Patients and methods: From the population-based China Kadoorie Biobank study, 443,792 healthy adults were recruited between June 2004 and July 2008. Participant's weekly PAI score was estimated and divided into four groups (PAI scores of 0, \u226450, 51-99, or \u2265100). Using Cox proportional hazard analyses, we calculated adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality related to PAI scores. Results: During a median follow-up of 8.2 (interquartile range, 7.3 to 9.1) years, there were 21,901 deaths, including 9466 CVD deaths. Compared with the inactive group (0 PAI score), a baseline weekly PAI score greater than or equal to 100 was associated with a lower risk of CVD mortality, an AHR of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.94) in men, and an AHR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.92) in women, after adjusting for multiple confounders. Participants with a weekly PAI score greater than or equal to 100 also had a lower risk of all-cause mortality (AHR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89 to 0.97 in men, and AHR, 0.93; 95%, 0.88 to 0.98 in women). Moreover, this subgroup gained 2.7 (95% CI, 2.4 to 3.0) years of life, compared with the inactive cohort. Conclusion: Among relatively healthy Chinese adults, the PAI metric was inversely associated with CVD and all-cause mortality, highlighting the generalizability of the score in different races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic strata.30227185<SEP>Sophie K Kieffer<SEP>Temporal Changes in a Novel Metric of Physical Activity Tracking (Personal Activity Intelligence) and Mortality: The HUNT Study, Norway<SEP>Background: Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a novel activity metric that translates heart rate variations during exercise into a weekly score. Weekly PAI scores assessed at a single point in time were found to associate with lower risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the general healthy population. However, to date, the associations between long-term longitudinal changes in weekly PAI scores and mortality have not been explored. Purpose: The aim of the present study was to prospectively examine the association between change in weekly PAI scores estimated 10 years apart, and risk of mortality from CVD and all-causes. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of 11,870 men and 13,010 women without known CVD in Norway. By using data from the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT), PAI was estimated twice, ten years apart (HUNT1 1984-86 and HUNT2 1995-97). Mortality was followed-up until December 31, 2015. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for death from CVD and all-causes related to temporal changes in PAI were estimated using Cox regression analyses. Results: During a mean (SD) of 18 (4) years of follow-up, there were 4782 deaths, including 1560 deaths caused by CVD. Multi-adjusted analyses demonstrated that participants achieving a score of \u2265100 PAI at both time points had 32% lower risk of CVD mortality (AHR 0.68; CI: 0.54-0.86) for CVD mortality and 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality (AHR 0.80; CI: 71-0.91) compared with participants obtaining <100 weekly PAI at both measurements. For participants having <100 PAI in HUNT1 but \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2, the AHRs were 0.87 (CI: 0.74-1.03) for CVD mortality, and 0.86 (CI: 0.79-0.95) for all-cause mortality. We also found an inverse linear relationship between change in PAI and risk of CVD mortality among participants with 0 PAI (P < 0.01), and \u226450 PAI (P = 0.04) in HUNT1, indicating that an increase in PAI over time is associated with lower risk of mortality. Excluding the first three years of follow-up did not substantially alter the findings. Increasing PAI score from <100 PAI in HUNT1 to \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2 was associated with 6.6 years gained lifespan. Conclusion: Among men and women without known CVD, an increase in PAI score and sustained high PAI score over a 10-year period was associated with lower risk of mortality.",
    "answer": "If a person were to cease regular exercise, it could lead to an increase in sedentary behavior, which is associated with clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Regular exercise helps maintain a healthy cardiovascular system and reduces the risk of premature CVD death. Monitoring activity levels using metrics like Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) can be beneficial in ensuring that enough physical activity is being performed to counteract the negative effects of sedentary behavior on cardiovascular risk factors. Studies have shown that individuals with a PAI score of \u2265100 weekly have a reduced risk of CVD mortality, regardless of whether they meet current physical activity recommendations. Therefore, ceasing regular exercise can potentially increase the risk of developing cardiovascular issues and other health complications associated with a sedentary lifestyle.",

A systematic review of the literature was conducted in order to identify relevant longitudinal and cross-sectional studies conducted from 1946 to 2017. A meta-analysis was performed from 24 studies testing the performance of chronic tobacco smokers compared with non-smokers on neuropsychological tests related to eight different neuropsychological domains. The results revealed a cross-sectional association between neuropsychological impairments and chronic tobacco smoking in cognitive impulsivity, non-planning impulsivity, attention, intelligence, short term memory, long term memory, and cognitive flexibility, with the largest effect size being related to cognitive impulsivity (SDM = 0.881, p <0.005), and the smallest effect size being related to intelligence (SDM = 0.164, p < 0.05) according to Cohen's benchmark criteria. No association was found between chronic smoking and motor impulsivity (SDM = 0.105, p = 0.248). Future research is needed to investigate further this association by focusing on better methodologies and alternative methods for nicotine administration.31715191<SEP>Pedro Rafael Figueiredo<SEP>Neurocognitive consequences of chronic cannabis use: a systematic review and meta-analysis<SEP>Cannabis is currently the most used illicit substance in the world with a global widespread distribution. Although its acute neurocognitive effects on human behaviour have been reported, there is a lack of robust analysis investigating the link, if any, between chronic cannabis use and neurocognitive function. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in order to identify relevant studies published from 2010 to 2019. A meta-analysis was performed on 13 selected studies testing performance of chronic cannabis users compared with non-users in six different neurocognitive domains. There was a low cross-sectional association between neurocognitive impairments and chronic cannabis use in cognitive impulsivity, cognitive flexibility, attention, short-term memory and long-term memory. No association was found between chronic cannabis use and motor impulsivity. By analysing a specific target population with strict inclusion criteria, these findings provide inconclusive evidence that there are cognitive impairments associated with chronic cannabis use. Future research is needed to determine if the findings of this meta-analysis are biased by the methodological limitations encountered.31245962<SEP>Tashia Petker<SEP>Cannabis involvement and neuropsychological performance: findings from the Human Connectome Project<SEP>Background: There is evidence that heavy cannabis use is associated with decrements in cognitive performance, but findings are mixed and studies are often limited by small sample sizes and narrow adjustment for potential confounding variables. In a comparatively large sample, the current study examined associations between multiple indicators of cannabis use in relation to performance on a variety of neuropsychological tasks. Methods: Participants were 1121 adults (54% female) enrolled in the Human Connectome Project. Cannabis involvement comprised recent cannabis use (positive tetrahydrocannabinol screen), total number of lifetime uses, cannabis use disorder and age at first use. The neuropsychological battery comprised performance in episodic memory, fluid intelligence, attention, working memory, executive function, impulsive decision-making, processing speed and psychomotor dexterity. Covariates were age, sex, income, family structure and alcohol and tobacco use. Results: Positive urinary tetrahydrocannabinol status was associated with worse performance in episodic memory and processing speed, and positive cannabis use disorder status was associated with lower fluid intelligence (all p < 0.005). No other significant associations were present. Limitations: The sample was limited to young adults aged 22\u201336 years. The measures of cannabis involvement were relatively coarse. Conclusion: Beyond an array of potential confounders, recent cannabis use was associated with deficits in memory and psychomotor performance, and cannabis use disorder was associated with lower overall cognitive functioning in a large normative sample of adults. The findings pertaining to recent use have particular relevance for occupational settings.33023701<SEP>Suzanne H Gage<SEP>Does smoking cause lower educational attainment and general cognitive ability? Triangulation of causal evidence using multiple study designs<SEP>Background: Observational studies have found associations between smoking and both poorer cognitive ability and lower educational attainment; however, evaluating causality is challenging. We used two complementary methods to explore this. Methods: We conducted observational analyses of up to 12 004 participants in a cohort study (Study One) and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses using summary and cohort data (Study Two). Outcome measures were cognitive ability at age 15 and educational attainment at age 16 (Study One), and educational attainment and fluid intelligence (Study Two). Results: Study One: heaviness of smoking at age 15 was associated with lower cognitive ability at age 15 and lower educational attainment at age 16. Adjustment for potential confounders partially attenuated findings (e.g. fully adjusted cognitive ability \u03b2 -0.736, 95% CI -1.238 to -0.233, p = 0.004; fully adjusted educational attainment \u03b2 -1.254, 95% CI -1.597 to -0.911, p < 0.001). Study Two: MR indicated that both smoking initiation and lifetime smoking predict lower educational attainment (e.g. smoking initiation to educational attainment inverse-variance weighted MR \u03b2 -0.197, 95% CI -0.223 to -0.171, p = 1.78 \u00d7 10-49). Educational attainment results were robust to sensitivity analyses, while analyses of general cognitive ability were less so. Conclusion: We find some evidence of a causal effect of smoking on lower educational attainment, but not cognitive ability. Triangulation of evidence across observational and MR methods is a strength, but the genetic variants associated with smoking initiation may be pleiotropic, suggesting caution in interpreting these results. The nature of this pleiotropy warrants further study.",
    "answer": "Based on the context provided, it is clear that chronic tobacco smoking can have negative effects on neuropsychological function. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 studies revealed a cross-sectional association between chronic tobacco smoking and impairments in cognitive impulsivity, attention, memory, intelligence, and cognitive flexibility. The study showed that chronic tobacco smokers performed worse on neuropsychological tests compared to non-smokers in these domains. The largest effect size was related to cognitive impulsivity, while the smallest effect size was related to intelligence.\n\nIn contrast, studies on cannabis use and neuropsychological performance have shown mixed results. While there is some evidence of a low association between chronic cannabis use and impairments in cognitive impulsivity, attention, memory, and flexibility, the findings are inconclusive. Different studies have reported varying results on the effects of cannabis use on neurocognitive function, and further research is needed to determine the extent of cognitive impairments associated with chronic cannabis use.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that quitting smoking may lead to improvements in various aspects of neuropsychological function, particularly those areas that were found to be negatively impacted by chronic tobacco smoking. On the other hand, the effects of quitting cannabis use on neuropsychological function are less clear and require additional research for a definitive understanding.",

    "context": "34836203<SEP>Francesco Capozzi<SEP>A Multidisciplinary Perspective of Ultra-Processed Foods and Associated Food Processing Technologies: A View of the Sustainable Road Ahead<SEP>Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are negatively perceived by part of the scientific community, the public, and policymakers alike, to the extent they are sometimes referred to as not \"real food\". Many observational surveys have linked consumption of UPFs to adverse health outcomes. This narrative synthesis and scientific reappraisal of available evidence aims to: (i) critically evaluate UPF-related scientific literature on diet and disease and identify possible research gaps or biases in the interpretation of data; (ii) emphasize the innovative potential of various processing technologies that can lead to modifications of the food matrix with beneficial health effects; (iii) highlight the possible links between processing, sustainability and circular economy through the valorisation of by-products; and (iv) delineate the conceptual parameters of new paradigms in food evaluation and classification systems. Although greater consumption of UPFs has been associated with obesity, unfavorable cardiometabolic risk factor profiles, and increased risk for non-communicable diseases, whether specific food processing techniques leading to ultra-processed formulations are responsible for the observed links between UPFs and various health outcomes remains elusive and far from being understood. Evolving technologies can be used in the context of sustainable valorisation of food processing by-products to create novel, low-cost UPFs with improved nutritional value and health potential. New paradigms of food evaluation and assessment should be funded and developed on several novel pillars-enginomics, signalling, and precision nutrition-taking advantage of available digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Research is needed to generate required scientific knowledge to either expand the current or create new food evaluation and classification systems, incorporating processing aspects that may have a significant impact on health and wellness, together with factors related to the personalization of foods and diets, while not neglecting recycling and sustainability aspects.

The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, has been gaining momentum since 2015, being a significant driver for sustainable development and a successful catalyst to tackle critical global challenges. This review paper summarizes the most relevant food Industry 4.0 technologies including, among others, digital technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, big data analytics, Internet of Things, and blockchain) and other technological advances (e.g., smart sensors, robotics, digital twins, and cyber-physical systems). Moreover, insights into the new food trends (such as 3D printed foods) that have emerged as a result of the Industry 4.0 technological revolution will also be discussed in Part II of this work. The Industry 4.0 technologies have significantly modified the food industry and led to substantial consequences for the environment, economics, and human health. Despite the importance of each of the technologies mentioned above, ground-breaking sustainable solutions could only emerge by combining many technologies simultaneously. The Food Industry 4.0 era has been characterized by new challenges, opportunities, and trends that have reshaped current strategies and prospects for food production and consumption patterns, paving the way for the move toward Industry 5.0.35685129<SEP>GuoJun Liang<SEP>Path of Regional Economic Transformation and Upgrading Based on Recurrent Neural Network<SEP>At present, the development of the regional economy is very rapid and widespread.

    "context": "36870969<SEP>Dinne Skj\u00e6rlund Christensen<SEP>Midlife perceived stress is associated with cognitive decline across three decades<SEP>Background: Research indicates detrimental effects of stress on brain health and cognitive functioning, but population-based studies using comprehensive measures of cognitive decline is lacking. The present study examined the association of midlife perceived stress with cognitive decline from young adulthood to late midlife, controlling for early life circumstances, education and trait stress (neuroticism). Methods: The sample consisted of 292 members of the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort (1959-1961) with continued participation in two subsequent follow-up studies. Cognitive ability was assessed in young adulthood (mean age 27 years) and midlife (mean age 56 years) using the full Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), and perceived stress was measured at midlife using the Perceived Stress Scale. The association of midlife perceived stress with decline in Verbal, Performance and Full-Scale IQ was assessed in multiple regression models based on Full Information Maximum Likelihood estimation. Results: Over a mean retest interval of 29 years, average decline in IQ score was 2.42 (SD 7.98) in Verbal IQ and 8.87 (SD 9.37) in Performance IQ. Mean decline in Full-scale IQ was 5.63 (SD 7.48), with a retest correlation of 0.83. Controlling for parental socio-economic position, education and young adult IQ, higher perceived stress at midlife was significantly associated with greater decline in Verbal (\u03b2 = - 0.012), Performance (\u03b2 = - 0.025), and Full-scale IQ (\u03b2 = - 0.021), all p < .05. Across IQ scales, additionally controlling for neuroticism in young adulthood and change in neuroticism had only minor effects on the association of midlife perceived stress with decline. Conclusions: Despite very high retest correlations, decline was observed on all WAIS IQ scales. In fully adjusted models, higher midlife perceived stress was associated with greater decline on all scales, indicating a negative association of stress with cognitive ability. The association was strongest for Performance and Full-scale IQ, perhaps reflecting the greater decline on these IQ scales compared to Verbal IQ.25925981<SEP>Francisca S Then<SEP>Differential effects of enriched environment at work on cognitive decline in old age<SEP>Objectives: The aim of the present study was to investigate how different mentally demanding work conditions during the professional life-i.e., enriched environments at work-might influence the rate of cognitive decline in old age. Methods: Individuals (n = 1,054) of the Leipzig Longitudinal Study of the Aged, a representative population-based cohort study of individuals aged 75 years and older, underwent cognitive testing via the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in up to 6 measurement waves. Type and level of mentally demanding work conditions in the participants' former professional life were classified based on the O*NET job descriptor database. Results: In multivariate mixed-model analyses (controlling for sociodemographic and health-related factors), a high level of mentally demanding work tasks stimulating verbal intelligence was significantly associated with a better cognitive functioning at baseline (on average 5 MMSE points higher) as well as a lower rate of cognitive decline (on average 2 MMSE points less) over the 8-year follow-up period compared with a low level. The rate of cognitive decline in old age was also significantly lower (on average 3 MMSE points less) in individuals who had a high level of mentally demanding work tasks stimulating executive functions than those who had a low level. Conclusions: The results suggest that a professional life enriched with work tasks stimulating verbal intelligence and executive functions may help to sustain a good cognitive functioning in old age (75+ years). The findings thus emphasize that today's challenging work conditions may also promote positive health effects.25052460<SEP>Benjamin B Lahey<SEP>Criterion validity of the general factor of psychopathology in a prospective study of girls<SEP>Background: The best-fitting model of the structure of common psychopathology often includes a general factor on which all dimensions of psychopathology load. Such a general factor would be important if it reflects etiologies and mechanisms shared by all dimensions of psychopathology. Nonetheless, a viable alternative explanation is that the general factor is partly or wholly a result of common method variance or other systematic measurement biases. Methods: To test this alternative explanation, we extracted general, externalizing, and internalizing factor scores using mother-reported symptoms across 5-11 years of age in confirmatory factor analyses of data from a representative longitudinal study of 2,450 girls. Independent associations between the three psychopathology factor scores and teacher-reported criterion variables were estimated in multiple regression, controlling intelligence, and demographic covariates. Results: The model including the general factor fit significantly better than a correlated two-factor (internalizing/externalizing) model. The general factor was robustly and independently associated with all measures of teacher-reported school functioning concurrently during childhood and prospectively during adolescence. Conclusions: These findings weaken the hypothesis that the general factor of psychopathology in childhood is solely a measurement artifact and support further research on the substantive meaning of the general factor.30676035<SEP>Elliot M Tucker-Drob<SEP>Coupled cognitive changes in adulthood: A meta-analysis<SEP>With advancing age, healthy adults typically exhibit decreases in performance across many different cognitive abilities such as memory, processing speed, spatial ability, and abstract reasoning. However, there are marked individual differences in rates of cognitive decline, with some adults declining steeply and others maintaining high levels of functioning. To move toward a comprehensive understanding of cognitive aging, it is critical to know whether individual differences in longitudinal changes interrelate across different cognitive abilities. We identified 89 effect sizes representing shared variance in longitudinal cognitive change from 22 unique datasets composed of more than 30,000 unique individuals, which we meta-analyzed using a series of multilevel metaregression models. An average of 60% of the variation in cognitive changes was shared across cognitive abilities. Shared variation in changes increased with age, from approximately 45% at age 35 years to approximately 70% at age 85 years. There was a moderate-to-strong correspondence (r = .49, congruence coefficient = .98) between the extent to which a variable indicated general intelligence and the extent to which change in that variable indicated a general factor of aging-related change. Shared variation in changes did not differ substantially across cognitive ability domain classifications. In a sensitivity analysis based on studies that carefully controlled for dementia, shared variation in longitudinal cognitive changes remained at upward of 60%, and age-related increases in shared variation in cognitive changes continued to be evident. These results together provide strong evidence for a general factor of cognitive aging that strengthens with advancing adult age. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",
    "answer": "Chronic stress can have a significant impact on mental well-being, particularly in relation to cognitive decline. Research has shown that higher levels of perceived stress in midlife are associated with greater decline in cognitive ability from young adulthood to late midlife. This decline was observed across various cognitive domains, including verbal intelligence, performance, and full-scale IQ. \n\nAdditionally, individuals who have been exposed to mentally demanding work conditions stimulating verbal intelligence and executive functions during their professional life tend to demonstrate better cognitive functioning in old age. This suggests that engaging in stimulating tasks throughout one's career can potentially help maintain cognitive abilities as individuals age.\n\nMoreover, there is evidence to support the presence of a general factor of psychopathology that may influence cognitive changes in adulthood. This general factor is robustly associated with various measures of school functioning and appears to have substantive meaning beyond mere measurement artifacts.\n\nOverall, chronic stress and engaging in mentally stimulating activities throughout life can have a significant impact on cognitive functioning and mental well-being as individuals age.

    "context": "29931335<SEP>Brian J Curtis<SEP>Objective cognitive functioning in self-reported habitual short sleepers not reporting daytime dysfunction: examination of impulsivity via delay discounting<SEP>Study objectives: (1) Examine performance on an objective measure of reward-related cognitive impulsivity (delay discounting) among self-reported habitual short sleepers and medium (i.e. recommended 7-9 hours) length sleepers either reporting or not reporting daytime dysfunction; (2) Inform the debate regarding what type and duration of short sleep (e.g. 21 to 24 hours of total sleep deprivation, self-reported habitual short sleep duration) meaningfully influences cognitive impulsivity; (3) Compare the predictive utility of sleep duration and perceived dysfunction to other factors previously shown to influence cognitive impulsivity via delay discounting performance (age, income, education, and fluid intelligence). Methods: We analyzed data from 1190 adults from the Human Connectome Project database. Participants were grouped on whether they reported habitual short (\u22646 hours) vs. medium length (7-9 hours) sleep duration and whether they perceived daytime dysfunction using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: All short sleepers exhibited increased delay discounting compared to all medium length sleepers, regardless of perceived dysfunction. Of the variables examined, self-reported sleep duration was the strongest predictor of delay discounting behavior between groups and across all 1190 participants. Conclusions: Individuals who report habitual short sleep are likely to exhibit increased reward-related cognitive impulsivity regardless of perceived sleep-related daytime impairment. Therefore, there is a reason to suspect that these individuals exhibit more daytime dysfunction, in the form of reward-related cognitive impulsivity, than they may assume. Current findings suggest that assessment of sleep duration over the prior month has meaningful predictive utility for human reward-related impulsivity.23509927<SEP>Joshua M Langberg<SEP>Clinical implications of daytime sleepiness for the academic performance of middle school-aged adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder<SEP>This study investigated the relative impact of total time slept per night and daytime sleepiness on the academic functioning of 100 middle school-aged youth (mean age = 11.9) with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The primary goal of the study was to determine if total time slept per night and/or daytime sleepiness, as measured by youth self-report on the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS), predicted academic functioning above and beyond symptoms of ADHD and relevant covariates, such as intelligence, achievement scores and parent education level. Self-reported daytime sleepiness but not self-reported total time slept per night was associated significantly with all academic outcomes. When examined in a hierarchical regression model, self-reported daytime sleepiness significantly predicted parent-rated homework problems and academic impairment and teacher-rated academic competence above and beyond symptoms of ADHD and relevant covariates, but did not predict grade point average or teacher-rated academic impairment. The implications of these findings for understanding more clearly the association between ADHD and sleep and the functional implications of this relationship are discussed.29776624<SEP>Michelle A Short<SEP>Cognition and objectively measured sleep duration in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis<SEP>Background: Sleep recommendations are widely used to guide communities on children's sleep needs. Following recent adjustments to guidelines by the National Sleep Foundation and the subsequent consensus statement by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, we undertook a systematic literature search to evaluate the current evidence regarding relationships between objectively measured sleep duration and cognitive function in children aged 5 to 13 years. Methods: Cognitive function included measures of memory, attention, processing speed, and intelligence in children aged 5 to 13 years. Keyword searches of 7 databases to December 2016 found 23 meeting inclusion criteria from 137 full articles reviewed, 19 of which were suitable for meta-analysis. Results: A significant effect (r = .06) was found between sleep duration and cognition, suggesting that longer sleep durations were associated with better cognitive functioning. Analyses of different cognitive domains revealed that full/verbal IQ was significantly associated with sleep loss, but memory, fluid IQ, processing speed and attention were not. Comparison of study sleep durations with current sleep recommendations showed that most children studied had sleep durations that were not within the range of recommended sleep. As such, the true effect of sleep loss on cognitive function may be obscured in these samples, as most children were sleep restricted. Conclusions: Future research using more rigorous experimental methodologies is needed to properly elucidate the relationship between sleep duration and cognition in this age group.35173500<SEP>Peng Li<SEP>Daytime Sleep Behaviors and Cognitive Performance in Middle- to Older-Aged Adults Living with and without HIV Infection<SEP>Purpose: We investigated whether daytime sleep behaviors (DSBs) such as frequent daytime sleepiness or napping are associated with worse cognitive performance, and whether HIV infection moderates this relationship. Methods: Among 502,507 participants in the UK Biobank study, we identified 562 people living with HIV infection (PLWH; M age= 50.51\u00b17.81; 25.09% female; 78.83% white) and extracted 562 uninfected controls who matched on age, sex, ethnic background, social-economic status, and comorbidities. DSB burden was assessed based on answers to two questions on DSBs. Participants who answered \"sometimes\" or \"often/usually\" to one of them were considered to have poor DSB burden, or otherwise were considered not having any. A composite cognition score was computed by averaging the available standardized individual test results from four neurocognitive tests: ie, a reaction time test for information processing speed, a pairs matching test for visual episodic memory, a fluid intelligence test for reasoning, and a prospective memory test. Mixed-effects models with adjustment for the variables used in extracting matched uninfected controls were performed to test the hypotheses. Results: Having poor DSB burden was associated with a 0.15 - standard deviation (SD) decrease in cognitive performance (p = 0.006). People living with HIV infection (PLWH) also performed worse on the cognitive tasks than uninfected controls, with an effect size similar to that of having poor DSB burden (p = 0.003). HIV infection significantly modified the negative association between DSB burden and cognition (p for interaction: 0.008). Specifically, the association between DSB burden and cognition was not statistically significant in uninfected controls, whereas PLWH who reported having poor DSB burden had a 0.28 - SD decrease in cognitive performance compared to PLWH who did not. Conclusion: HIV infection significantly increased the adverse association between DSBs and cognitive performance. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential mechanisms that underlie this interaction effect and whether poor DSBs and worse cognitive performance are causally linked.",
    "answer": "Consistently lacking sufficient sleep can have significant impacts on cognitive functioning, impulsivity, and overall cognitive performance. From the study on habitual short sleepers, it was found that individuals who report habitual short sleep durations are likely to exhibit increased reward-related cognitive impulsivity. This impulsivity was observed regardless of perceived sleep-related daytime impairment. The results showed that all short sleepers exhibited increased delay discounting compared to medium length sleepers, indicating a link between insufficient sleep and impulsivity.\n\nMoreover, in a study on middle school-aged adolescents with ADHD, self-reported daytime sleepiness was significantly associated with academic outcomes, indicating that inadequate sleep can interfere with academic performance. This suggests that daytime sleepiness, a result of insufficient sleep, can impact cognitive functions such as attention and memory, leading to academic challenges.\n\nFurthermore, research on children aged 5 to 13 years revealed that longer sleep durations were associated with better cognitive functioning. Specifically, full/verbal IQ was significantly associated with sleep loss, highlighting the importance of adequate sleep for cognitive development in children.\n\nOverall, consistently lacking sufficient sleep can lead to impaired cognitive performance, impulsivity, and academic difficulties. It is crucial to prioritize sleep and ensure adequate rest to support cognitive function and overall well-being.",

    "context": "36968816<SEP>Seyma Handan Akyon<SEP>Artificial intelligence-supported web application design and development for reducing polypharmacy side effects and supporting rational drug use in geriatric patients<SEP>Introduction: The main complications of polypharmacy, which is known as the simultaneous use of more than five drugs, are potentially inappropriate medicines(PIMs), drug-drug, and drug-disease interaction. It is aimed to prepare an auxiliary tool to reduce the complications of polypharmacy and to support rational drug use(RDU), by evaluating the patient with age, drugs, and chronic diseases in this study. Materials and methods: In the first phase of this study, as methodological research, an up-to-date and comprehensive auxiliary tool as a reference method was generated with a database containing interaction information of 430 most commonly used drug agents and chronic diseases in geriatrics in the light of current and valid 6 PIM criteria for geriatric patients, and medication prospectuses, relevant current articles, and guidelines. Then, an artificial intelligence(AI) supported web application was designed and developed to facilitate the practical use of the tool. Afterward, the data of a cross-sectional observational single-center study were used for the rate and time of PIM and drug interaction detection with the web application. The proposed web application is publicly available at https://fastrational.com/. Results: While the PIM coverage rate with the proposed tool was 75.3%, the PIM coverage rate of EU(7)-PIM, US-FORTA, TIME-to-STOPP, Beers 2019, STOPP, Priscus criteria in the web application database respectively(63.5%-19.5%) from the highest to the lowest. The proposed tool includes all PIMs, drug-drug, and drug-disease interaction information detected with other criteria. A general practitioner detects interactions for a patient without the web application in 2278 s on average, while the time with the web application is decreased to 33.8 s on average, and this situation is statistically significant. Discussion: In the literature and this study, the PIM criteria alone are insufficient to include actively used medicines and it shows heterogeneity. In addition, many studies showed that the biggest obstacle to drug regulation in practice is \"time constraints.\" The proposed comprehensive auxiliary tool analyzes age, drugs, and diseases specifically for the patient 60 times faster than the manual method, and it provides quick access to the relevant references, and ultimately supports RDU for the clinician, with the first and only AI-supported web application.37845024<SEP>David K Ryan<SEP>Artificial intelligence and machine learning for clinical pharmacology<SEP>Artificial intelligence (AI) will impact many aspects of clinical pharmacology, including drug discovery and development, clinical trials, personalized medicine, pharmacogenomics, pharmacovigilance and clinical toxicology.

As with any new therapy or health technology, it is imperative that AI tools are subject to robust and stringent evaluation to ensure that they enhance clinical practice in a safe and equitable manner. This review serves as an introduction to AI for the clinical pharmacologist, highlighting current applications, aspects of model development and issues surrounding evaluation and deployment.

However, because infectious diseases are common, many patients desire access to knowledge via a search engine. Although the use of antibiotics should, in principle, be subject to a doctor's advice, many patients take them without authorization, and some people cannot easily or rapidly consult a doctor. In such cases, a reliable antibiotic prescription support system is needed. Methods and results: This study describes the construction and optimization of the sensitivity and specificity of a decision support system named IDDAP, which is based on ontologies for infectious disease diagnosis and antibiotic therapy. The ontology for this system was constructed by collecting existing ontologies associated with infectious diseases, syndromes, bacteria and drugs into the ontology's hierarchical conceptual schema. First, IDDAP identifies a potential infectious disease based on a patient's self-described disease state. Then, the system searches for and proposes an appropriate antibiotic therapy specifically adapted to the patient based on factors such as the patient's body temperature, infection sites, symptoms/signs, complications, antibacterial spectrum, contraindications, drug-drug interactions between the proposed therapy and previously prescribed medication, and the route of therapy administration. The constructed domain ontology contains 1,267,004 classes, 7,608,725 axioms, and 1,266,993 members of \"SubClassOf\" that pertain to infectious diseases, bacteria, syndromes, anti-bacterial drugs and other relevant components. The system includes 507 infectious diseases and their therapy methods in combination with 332 different infection sites, 936 relevant symptoms of the digestive, reproductive, neurological and other systems, 371 types of complications, 838,407 types of bacteria, 341 types of antibiotics, 1504 pairs of reaction rates (antibacterial spectrum) between antibiotics and bacteria, 431 pairs of drug interaction relationships and 86 pairs of antibiotic-specific population contraindicated relationships. Compared with the existing infectious disease-relevant ontologies in the field of knowledge comprehension, this ontology is more complete. Analysis of IDDAP's performance in terms of classifiers based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve results (89.91%) revealed IDDAP's advantages when combined with our ontology. Conclusions and significance: This study attempted to bridge the patient/caregiver gap by building a sophisticated application that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning computational techniques to perform data-driven decision-making at the point of primary care. The first level of decision-making is conducted by the IDDAP and provides the patient with a first-line therapy. Patients can then make a subjective judgment, and if any questions arise, should consult a physician for subsequent decisions, particularly in complicated cases or in cases in which the necessary information is not yet available in the knowledge base.38051030<SEP>Nathan Teuscher<SEP>The history and future of population pharmacokinetic analysis in drug development<SEP>1. The analysis of pharmacokinetic data has been in a constant state of evolution since the introduction of the term pharmacokinetics. Early work focused on mechanistic understanding of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drug products.2. The introduction of non-linear mixed effects models to perform population pharmacokinetic analysis initiated a paradigm shift. The application of these models represented a major shift in evaluating variability in pharmacokinetic parameters across a population of subjects.3. While technological advancements in computing power have feuled the growth of population pharmacokinetics in drug development efforts, there remain many challenges in reducing the time required to incorporate these learnings into a model-informed development process. These challenges exist because of expanding datasets, increased number of diagnostics, and more complex mathematical models.4. New machine learning tools may be potential solutions for these challenges. These new methodologies include genetic algorithms for model selection, machine learning algorithms for covariate selection, and deep learning models for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. These new methods promise the potential for less bias, faster analysis times, and the ability to integrate more data.5. While questions remain regarding the ability of these models to extrapolate accurately, continued research in this area is expected to address these questions.",

    "context": "34585001<SEP>Ugochukwu Ewuzie<SEP>An appraisal of data collection, analysis, and reporting adopted for water quality assessment: A case of Nigeria water quality research<SEP>The appropriate acquisition and processing of water quality data are crucial for water resource management. As such, published articles on water quality monitoring and assessment are meant to convey essential and reliable information to water quality experts, decision-makers, researchers, students, and the public. The implication is that such information must emanate from data obtained and analysed in an up-to-date, scientifically sound manner. Thus, inappropriate data analysis and reporting techniques could yield misleading results and mar the endeavours of achieving error-free conclusions. This study utilises the findings on water quality assessment in Nigeria over the last 20 years to reveal the likely trends in water quality research regarding data collection, data analysis, and reporting for physicochemical, bacteriological parameters, and trace organics. A total of 123 Web of Science and quartile ranked (Q1-Q4) published articles involving water quality assessment in Nigeria were analysed. Results indicated shortcomings in various aspects of data analysis and reporting. Consequently, we use simulated heatmaps and graphs to illustrate preferred ways of analysing, reporting, and visualising some regularly used descriptive and inferential statistics of water quality variables. Finally, we highlight alternative approaches to the customarily applied water quality assessment methods in Nigeria and emphasise other areas of deficiency that need attention for improved water quality research.34609681<SEP>Waidah Ismail<SEP>Water treatment and artificial intelligence techniques: a systematic literature review research<SEP>As clean water can be considered among the essentials of human life, there is always a requirement to seek its foremost and high quality. Water primarily becomes polluted due to organic as well as inorganic pollutants, including nutrients, heavy metals, and constant contamination with organic materials. Predicting the quality of water accurately is essential for its better management along with controlling pollution. With stricter laws regarding water treatment to remove organic and biologic materials along with different pollutants, looking for novel technologic procedures will be necessary for improved control of the treatment processes by water utilities. Linear regression-based models with relative simplicity considering water prediction have been typically used as available statistical models. Nevertheless, in a majority of real problems, particularly those associated with modeling of water quality, non-linear patterns will be observed, requiring non-linear models to address them. Thus, artificial intelligence (AI) can be a good candidate in modeling and optimizing the elimination of pollutants from water in empirical settings with the ability to generate ideal operational variables, due to its recent considerable advancements. Management and operation of water treatment procedures are supported technically by these technologies, leading to higher efficiency compared to sole dependence on human operations. Thus, establishing predictive models for water quality and subsequently, more efficient management of water resources would be critically important, serving as a strong tool. A systematic review methodology has been employed in the present work to investigate the previous studies over the time interval of 2010-2020, while analyzing and synthesizing the literature, particularly regarding AI application in water treatment. A total number of 92 articles had addressed the topic under study using AI. Based on the conclusions, the application of AI can obviously facilitate operations, process automation, and management of water resources in significantly volatile contexts.35990916<SEP>Figene Ahmedi<SEP>Dataset on water quality monitoring from a wireless sensor network in a river in Kosovo<SEP>This dataset was collected as part of the InWaterSense project with a wireless sensor network (WSN) installed in a site in river Sitnica in Kosovo, as a case study for monitoring remotely, continuously and in real-time the surface water quality in Kosovo and how it can be extended to all surface waters in the country for quality assurance. Values of four water quality parameters are provided in the dataset, i.e., temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, and dissolved oxygen measured by respective static sensors of WSN in the time frame between May 2015 to beginning of January 2016 and every 10 min, counting to slightly over 100k measurement records in total. The dataset is hosted at the Mendeley Data repository (Ahmedi and Ahmedi 2021), and is related to the research article entitled \"InWaterSense: An Intelligent Wireless Sensor Network for Monitoring Surface Water Quality to a River in Kosovo\" (Ahmedi et al., 2018). The reuse potential of the dataset to the scientific community is widespread, from environmental engineering to artificial intelligence to the health sector just to mention few. Moreover, practitioners might benefit from this dataset in driving forth the pollution prevention policies and techniques. Data were acquired measuring water quality using static sensors installed as part of a wireless sensor network in Sitnica river in the Plemetin village near Prishtina, then transmitted to the gateway device also in Plemetin via the ZigBee protocol, and finally transmitted remotely via GPRS to the server machine in the premises of the University of Prishtina.

Gases, particulate matter, organic compounds but also allergens and viruses, fall within the 'pollutant' definition. Distinct populations, such as children and allergy and asthma sufferers are highly susceptible, while a low socioeconomic background is a further susceptibility factor; however, no specific guidance is available. We spend most of our time indoors; for children, the school environment is of paramount importance and potentially amenable to intervention. The interactions between some pollutant classes have been studied. However, a lot is missing with respect to understanding interactions between specific pollutants of different classes in terms of concentrations, timing and sequence, to improve targeting and upgrade standards. SynAir-G is a European Commission-funded project aiming to reveal and quantify synergistic interactions between different pollutants affecting health, from mechanisms to real life, focusing on the school setting. It will develop a comprehensive and responsive multipollutant monitoring system, advance environmentally friendly interventions, and disseminate the generated knowledge to relevant stakeholders in accessible and actionable formats.

Nearly 300 participants from all over the globe were welcomed by the host institution, the Institute of Biomedicine of Seville (IBiS). Following the theme \"The perfect tandem: How technology expands the frontiers of biomedicine\", the Scientific Symposium of the conference hosted eight world-renowned keynote speakers who presented their work in one of the four sessions: Innovation, Basic Research, Translational and Clinical Research, and Computational Biology and Artificial Intelligence. Participants had the chance to present their research to their peers: more than 200 posters were presented during the dedicated poster sessions and 19 selected PhD students and postdocs presented their work as short talks. The Career Day featured a wide range of workshops fully devoted to trainees' professional development, as well as a job fair and career chats with professionals to discuss future perspectives. Besides, several outreach activities were organised before and during the conference to engage with the general public and bring science closer to society.

However, few studies have simultaneously analyzed the association between the aforementioned factors and preschool child (aged 2-5 years) development. This study investigated the effects of those factors on child development and their potential modifying effects. A total of 142 participants were recruited from a birth cohort study in the Greater Taipei Area, and the evaluation was conducted at each participant's home from 2017 to 2020. Child cognitive development was assessed by psychologists using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development and the Wechsler Preschool & Primary Scale of Intelligence. Household air pollutants, outdoor residential environment, indoor household characteristics, parental mental health, and other covariates were evaluated. Multiple regressions were used to examine the relationships between child development and covariates. Stratified analysis by child sex and parental mental health was conducted. Average indoor air pollutant levels were below Taiwan's Indoor Air Quality Standards. After adjustment for covariates, the indoor total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) level was significantly associated with poor child development (per interquartile range increase in the TVOC level was associated with a 5.1 percentile decrease in child cognitive development). Sex difference was observed for the association between TVOC exposure and child development. Living near schools, burning incense at home, purchasing new furniture, and parental anxiety were related to child development. Indoor TVOC level was associated with poor child cognitive development, specifically with the girls. Indoor and outdoor residential environment and parental anxiety interfered with child development. TVOCs should be used cautiously at home to minimize child exposure. A low-pollution living environment should be provided to ensure children's healthy development.37258643<SEP>Graham Coulby<SEP>Understanding the scalability of personalised monitoring within indoor spaces<SEP>Health and wellness/well-being are multifaceted topics further complicated when trying to understand the environmental impact.

    "context": "35459950<SEP>Ross D Booton<SEP>Modelling the effect of COVID-19 mass vaccination on acute hospital admissions<SEP>Background: Managing high levels of acute COVID-19 bed occupancy can affect the quality of care provided to both affected patients and those requiring other hospital services. Mass vaccination has offered a route to reduce societal restrictions while protecting hospitals from being overwhelmed. Yet, early in the mass vaccination effort, the possible impact on future bed pressures remained subject to considerable uncertainty. Objective: The aim of this study was to model the effect of vaccination on projections of acute and intensive care bed demand within a 1 million resident healthcare system located in South West England. Methods: An age-structured epidemiological model of the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered type was fitted to local data up to the time of the study, in early March 2021. Model parameters and vaccination scenarios were calibrated through a system-wide multidisciplinary working group, comprising public health intelligence specialists, healthcare planners, epidemiologists and academics. Scenarios assumed incremental relaxations to societal restrictions according to the envisaged UK Government timeline, with all restrictions to be removed by 21 June 2021. Results: Achieving 95% vaccine uptake in adults by 31 July 2021 would not avert the third wave in autumn 2021 but would produce a median peak bed requirement \u223c6% (IQR: 1-24%) of that experienced during the second wave (January 2021). A 2-month delay in vaccine rollout would lead to significantly higher peak bed occupancy, at 66% (11-146%) of that of the second wave. If only 75% uptake was achieved (the amount typically associated with vaccination campaigns), then the second wave peak for acute and intensive care beds would be exceeded by 4% and 19%, respectively, an amount which would seriously pressure hospital capacity. Conclusion: Modelling influenced decision-making among senior managers in setting COVID-19 bed capacity levels, as well as highlighting the importance of public health in promoting high vaccine uptake among the population. Forecast accuracy has since been supported by actual data collected following the analysis, with observed peak bed occupancy falling comfortably within the inter-quartile range of modelled projections.33818952<SEP>S Amanpour<SEP>The Rapid Development and Early Success of Covid 19 Vaccines Have Raised Hopes for Accelerating the Cancer Treatment Mechanism<SEP>The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about rapid change in medical science. The production of new generation vaccines for this disease has surprised even their most optimistic supporters. Not only have these vaccines proven to be effective, but the importance of this disease and pandemic situation also significantly shortened the long-standing process of validating such products. Vaccination is a type of immunotherapy. Researchers have long been looking at vaccines as a possible treatment for cancer (Geynisman et al., 2014). In the same way that vaccines work against infectious diseases, attempts are being made to develop vaccines to identify specific proteins on cancer cells. This helps the immune system recognize and attack cancer cells. Cancer vaccines may help: I) Prevent the growth of cancer cells (Bialkowski et al., 2016), II) Prevent recurrence of cancer (Stanton and Disis, 2015), III) Destroy cancer cells left over from other treatments. The following types of cancer vaccines are being studied: Antigen Vaccines. These vaccines are made from specific proteins or antigens of cancerous cells. Their purpose is to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells (Tagliamonte et al., 2014). Whole-Cell Vaccines. A whole-cell vaccine uses the entire cancer cell, not just a specific molecule (antigen), to generate the vaccine. (Keenan and Jaffee, 2012).Dendritic Cell Vaccines. Dendritic cells help the immune system identify abnormal cells, such as cancerous cells. Dendritic cells are grown with cancer cells in the laboratory to produce the vaccine. The vaccine then stimulates the immune system to attack cancer. (Wang et al., 2014; Mastelic-Gavillet et al., 2019). DNA Vaccines. These vaccines are made from DNA fragments of cancer cells. They can be injected into the body to facilitate immune system cells can better respond and kill cancer cells (Gatti-Mays et al., 2017).Other Types of Cancer Vaccines. such as Anti idiotype vaccines. This vaccine stimulates the body to generate antibodies against cancerous cells. An example of an anti-idiotype antibody is Racotumomab or Vaxira (Cancer, 2016). However, conditions and considerations after Corona does not seem to be the same as before. The current pandemic situation has also led to major changes in the pharmaceutical and Vaccine production process and international protocols. Some of the most critical issues that can accelerate the introduction of cancer vaccines are: 1. Typical drug and vaccine development timeline. A typical vaccine needs 5 to 10 years and sometimes longer to design secure funding, and get approval (Figure 1). Less than 10 percent of new drugs, which are entered in the different phases of clinical trials, are advanced to approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)(Cancer, 2020a). However, now the situation is not normal. Dozens of Covid 19 vaccines are starting clinical trials. Some of them use RNA and DNA technology, which delivers the body with missions to produce its antibodies against the virus. There are already at least 254 therapies and 95 vaccines related to Covid-19 being explored. However, it seems that the experiences gained in this pandemic, and advances in technology, may be effective in shortening the production path of other vaccines and drugs and the process of its approval at the national and international levels in the future. In Figure 2, the time course of production of conventional vaccines in comparison with Covid 19 vaccines (Cancer, 2020b) is shown.2. The introduction of messenger RNA (mRNA) technology into the field of prevention and treatment. Over the past decades, this technology has been considered an excellent alternative to conventional vaccination methods. Proper potency and low side effects, the possibility of fast production and relatively low production cost are its advantages. However, until recently, the instability of this molecule has been a major problem in its application. This research was started many years ago by two companies that played a significant role in developing the first Covid vaccines, so BioNTech and Moderna were able to quickly transfer their experience in the field of Covid vaccine development (Pardi et al., 2018; Moderna, 2020). Figure 3 shows how mRNA vaccines work. Bout Pfizer &amp;ndash; BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines were more than 90 % effective in preclinical stages. Millions of doses of these two vaccines are currently being injected into eligible individuals worldwide. 3. Considering the use of artificial intelligence in assessing the effectiveness of vaccines. There are always doubts about the effectiveness of the new drug in treating the disease. Once the vaccine is widely available, we will know more about its effectiveness versus it works under carefully controlled scientific testing conditions. Vaccines will continue to be monitored after use. The data collected helps professionals understand how they work in different groups of people (depending on factors such as age, ethnicity, and people with different health conditions) and also the length of protection provided by the vaccine. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging field, which reaches everywhere and not only as a beneficial industrial tool but also as a practical tool in medical science and plays a crucial role in developing the computation vision, risk assessment, diagnostic, prognostic, etc. models in the field of medicine (Amisha et al., 2019). According to the wide range of AI applications in the analysis of different types of data, it can be used in vaccine production, safety assessments, clinical and preclinical studies and Covid 19 vaccines adverse reactions (CDC, 2019). Indeed, most cancer vaccines are therapeutic, rather than prophylactic, and seek to stimulate cell-mediated responses, such as those from CTLs, capable of clearing or reducing tumor burden. There are currently FDA-approved products for helping cancer treatment such as BREYANZI, TECARTUS and YESCARTA for lymphoma, IMLYGIC for melanoma, KYMRIAH for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and PROVENGE for prostate cancer. Over the past decade, most of BioNTech&amp;#39;s activities have been in the field of cancer vaccine design and production for melanoma (two clinical trials), breast cancer (one clinical trial), and the rest concerning viral and veterinary vaccines (two clinical trials). Also Maderno company has been working on Individualized cancer vaccines (one clinical trials), and vaccines for viral infections such as Zika and Influenza and veterinary vaccines (several clinical trials) (Pardi et al., 2018). Therefore, it can be said, mRNA technology that has been the subject of much research into the treatment of cancer has been shifted and rapidly used to produce and use the Covid 19 vaccine. The current pandemic situation has necessitated the acceleration of Covid 19 vaccines and drugs and national and international protocols for their approval. If the currently produced vaccines can continue to be as successful as the preclinical and early phase studies, these changes and evolution have raised hopes for accelerating the use of these technologies and mechanisms in the field of cancer and other diseases vaccines, including HIV and influenza.38081661<SEP>Abraham George<SEP>Planning for healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Southeast of England: a system dynamics modelling approach<SEP>Objectives: To develop, test, validate and implement a system dynamics model to simulate the pandemic progress and the impact of various interventions on viral spread, healthcare utilisation and demand in secondary care. Design: We adopted the system dynamics model incorporating susceptible, exposed, infection and recovery framework to simulate the progress of the pandemic and how the interventions for the COVID-19 response influence the outcomes with a focus on secondary care. Setting: This study was carried out covering all the local health systems in Southeast of England with a catchment population of six million with a specific focus on Kent and Medway system. Participants: Six local health systems in Southeast of England using Kent and Medway as a case study. Interventions: Short to medium 'what if' scenarios incorporating human behaviour, non-pharmaceutical interventions and medical interventions were tested using the model with regular and continuous feedback of the model results to the local health system leaders for monitoring, planning and rapid response as needed. Main outcome measures: Daily output from the model which included number infected in the population, hospital admissions needing COVID-19 care, occupied general beds, continuous positive airway pressure beds, intensive care beds, hospital discharge pathways and deaths. Results: We successfully implemented a regional series of models based on the local population needs which were used in healthcare planning as part of the pandemic response. Conclusions: In this study, we have demonstrated the utility of system dynamics modelling incorporating local intelligence and collaborative working during the pandemic to respond rapidly and take decisions to protect the population. This led to strengthened cooperation among partners and ensured that the local population healthcare needs were met.36895308<SEP>Miguel Ortiz-Barrios<SEP>Artificial intelligence and discrete-event simulation for capacity management of intensive care units during the Covid-19 pandemic: A case study<SEP>The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) into significant operational disruptions. The rapid evolution of this disease, the bed capacity constraints, the wide variety of patient profiles, and the imbalances within health supply chains still represent a challenge for policymakers. This paper aims to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) to support ICU bed capacity management during Covid-19. The proposed approach was validated in a Spanish hospital chain where we initially identified the predictors of ICU admission in Covid-19 patients. Second, we applied Random Forest (RF) to predict ICU admission likelihood using patient data collected in the Emergency Department (ED). Finally, we included the RF outcomes in a DES model to assist decision-makers in evaluating new ICU bed configurations responding to the patient transfer expected from downstream services. The results evidenced that the median bed waiting time declined between 32.42 and 48.03 min after intervention.",
    "answer": "If the recommended vaccination schedule was not followed, there could be significant consequences in terms of public health outcomes. Based on the context provided, modeling the effect of COVID-19 mass vaccination on acute hospital admissions showed that achieving lower vaccine uptake percentages or delays in vaccine rollout could lead to higher peak bed occupancy rates. For example, a 2-month delay in vaccine rollout could result in significantly higher peak bed occupancy, potentially reaching 66% of that experienced during previous waves of the pandemic. Similarly, if only 75% vaccine uptake was achieved, which is typical for vaccination campaigns, it could exceed peak bed requirements for acute and intensive care beds, putting serious pressure on hospital capacity.\n\nTherefore, not following the recommended vaccination schedule could result in increased strain on healthcare systems, potentially leading to overwhelmed hospitals with higher bed occupancy rates and impacting the quality of care provided to patients. It highlights the importance of timely vaccination efforts and high vaccine uptake to effectively reduce the burden on healthcare resources during a pandemic situation like COVID-19.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of aerobic and resistance training on cognitive ability. Methods: A computerized literature search was carried out using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase SCOPUS, Web of Science, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wanfang, and VIP database to identify relevant articles from inception through to 1 October 2022. Based on a preliminary search of the database and the references cited, 10,338 records were identified. For the measured values of the research results, the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to synthesize the effect size. Results: Finally, 10 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Since the outcome indicators of each literature are different in evaluating the old cognitive ability, a subgroup analysis was performed on the included literature. The study of results suggests that aerobic or resistance training interventions significantly improved cognitive ability in older adults compared with control interventions with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MD 2.76; 95% CI 2.52 to 3.00), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MD 2.64; 95% CI 2.33 to 2.94), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (MD 2.86; 95% CI 2.25 to 3.47), the Wechsler Memory Scale (MD 9.33; 95% CI 7.12 to 11.54), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (MD 5.31; 95% CI 1.20 to 9.43), the Trail Making Tests (MD -8.94; 95% CI -9.81 to -8.07), and the Stroop Color and Word Test (MD -5.20; 95% CI -7.89 to -2.51). Conclusion: Physical exercise improved the cognitive function of the older adults in all mental states. To improve cognitive ability, this meta-analysis recommended that patients perform at least moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and resistance exercise on as many days as possible in the week to comply with current exercise guidelines while providing evidence for clinicians.23795956<SEP>Barbara Griffin<SEP>The Undergraduate Medical and Health Sciences Admissions Test: what is it measuring?<SEP>Background: The Undergraduate Medical and Health Sciences Admissions Test (UMAT) is used to select medical students in Australia and New Zealand but empirical evidence of its construct validity has never been reported. Aims: To identify the underlying constructs assessed in each of the three sections of the UMAT. Based on conclusions from an early qualitative study (Mercer & Chiavaroli 2006), it was expected that Section 1 scores would correlate with scores obtained from standard measures of cognitive ability (verbal and numeric reasoning), Section 2 scores would correlate with emotional intelligence, and Section 3 scores would be most strongly related to abstract or non-verbal reasoning ability. Method: Final year high school students (n = 432) completed tests of numerical, verbal, and non-verbal cognitive ability, and emotional intelligence. Correlations and multiple regressions assessed the relationship of these tests with scores on each section of the UMAT. Results: UMAT Section 1 was significantly related to verbal, non-verbal, and numerical reasoning tests. Section 2 was significantly related to emotional intelligence and verbal reasoning, but the majority of variance in this section's scores remained unexplained. Section 3 scores significantly correlated with non-verbal and numerical reasoning. Conclusions: The UMAT Sections 1 and 3 appear to be tests of cognitive abilities. Further research is required to identify the constructs being measured by Section 2.24657405<SEP>Monika Meyer-Baron<SEP>Toward better research practice--shortcomings decreasing the significance of epidemiological studies in the toxicological field<SEP>Neurobehavioral studies do not always gain the impact they should have, neither in the scientific nor in the regulatory field of neurotoxicology. Among others, shortcomings and inconsistencies across epidemiological studies may contribute to this situation. Examples were compiled to increase awareness of obstacles for conclusions. Meta-analyses were exploited since they sometimes allow the detection of deficits that are not obvious from individual studies. Exposure assessment, performance measures, and confounding were scrutinized among 98 primary studies included in meta-analyses on mercury, solvents, manganese and pesticides. Inconsistent and hardly comparable markers of exposure were found; figures, units or sampling periods were not always provided. The contribution of test materials to differences in test outcomes across studies could sometimes not be evaluated due to the insufficient description of the employed tests. Hypotheses for the selection of performance variables often remained undisclosed. Matching procedures prevailed with respect to the confounder age; the comparability of groups with respect to intelligence and gender remained more elusive. 8% and 16% of the studies did not even mention confounding from intelligence and gender, respectively. Only one third of the studies provided adjusted means for group comparisons; the proportion was slightly larger for studies published 2000-2010. While 50% of the studies considered confounders for their dose-response assessment, only 29% reported results for the total of test variables. The outlined deficits impede, among others, the assessment of exposure-effect relationships and confounding across studies; thereby they limit the use of the studies for toxicological risk assessment and future prevention. Some shortcomings also impede a deeper insight into the mechanisms of toxicity: tests like the Digit Symbol show that something is affected, but not what is affected. Thorough description of measures employed is among the first consequences from the data. The consideration of mechanistic insights from research on animals and neurobiology may further help to increase the significance of epidemiological studies.37884125<SEP>Zhenzhen Mu<SEP>Effect of hypoglycemia on cognitive performance in older patients with diabetes: A meta-analysis<SEP>Goals: The goal of this study was to use meta-analysis to compile information from various studies to investigate the existence and severity of cognitive impairment in elderly diabetes patients who have hypoglycemic episodes. Materials and techniques: For research studies on the relationship between hypoglycemia and cognitive decline or dementia in persons older than 45 years, we searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CNKI, WanFang, CBM and VIP databases for the period 1989 to 2022. We conducted random effects inverse variance on the meta-analysis and used the I2 statistic to assess heterogeneity. Result: We selected 44 of the 518 studies we retrieved, 7 being appropriate for meta-analysis. Six thousand and forty-five individuals were involved in total. Both types of older diabetic patients with hypoglycemia performed considerably worse on tests of general intelligence than control participants (standardized mean difference, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.88-0.28). Also, elderly type-2 diabetes patients with hypoglycemic episodes had significantly worse memory performance (standardized mean difference, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.29-0.09). Additionally, we found that older type-2 diabetes patients with hypoglycemia had significantly poorer psychomotor function than those without hypoglycemia (standardized mean difference, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38-0.63).",
    "answer": "In response to the question about how the body would respond to a high-intensity workout without prior training, it is important to consider the context provided from the database. The information focuses on studies related to cognitive function in older adults, specifically through exercise interventions. \n\nWhen considering the effects of exercise on cognitive ability, the studies show that both aerobic and resistance training significantly improve cognitive ability in older adults compared to control interventions. This improvement is seen across various cognitive tests such as the Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Wechsler Memory Scale, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Trail Making Tests, and Stroop Color and Word Test.\n\nTherefore, in the context of cognitive function in older adults, engaging in physical exercise, even at a moderate intensity, can lead to improvements in cognitive ability. This suggests that the body can adapt positively to physical challenges, such as high-intensity workouts, even without prior training, ultimately benefiting cognitive function.",

    "context": "35426740<SEP>Arthur L M Swislocki<SEP>Glucose Trajectory: More than Changing Glucose Tolerance with Age?<SEP>While glucose tolerance is widely known to deteriorate with age, there are individuals whose borderline elevated glucose does not presage development of diabetes, but there are people who do develop overt diabetes. In addition, elevated glucose may also presage other morbidities, particularly for those who show progressive deterioration in glucose control over time. This concept of the glucose trajectory has taken on recent significance with sophisticated mathematical modeling that can identify several different arcs, primarily based on longitudinal changes in fasting plasma glucose. Other trajectories, calculated on changes in glycated hemoglobin, or integrated responses to oral glucose tolerance tests, are less well characterized. The author has reviewed the literature in an attempt to clarify these different themes of age-related deterioration in glucose control, highlight conflicting definitions of glucose trajectory, and potentially identify avenues of further investigation. Genetic contributions to the risk of development of type 2 diabetes, artificial intelligence and mathematical models of diabetes risk, and the discrepancy between fasting glucose and postprandial measures, including glycated hemoglobin, in risk prediction are also considered.35723321<SEP>Pierre Bongrand<SEP>Is There a Need for a More Precise Description of Biomolecule Interactions to Understand Cell Function?<SEP>An important goal of biological research is to explain and hopefully predict cell behavior from the molecular properties of cellular components. Accordingly, much work was done to build extensive \"omic\" datasets and develop theoretical methods, including computer simulation and network analysis to process as quantitatively as possible the parameters contained in these resources. Furthermore, substantial effort was made to standardize data presentation and make experimental results accessible to data scientists. However, the power and complexity of current experimental and theoretical tools make it more and more difficult to assess the capacity of gathered parameters to support optimal progress in our understanding of cell function. The purpose of this review is to focus on biomolecule interactions, the interactome, as a specific and important example, and examine the limitations of the explanatory and predictive power of parameters that are considered as suitable descriptors of molecular interactions. Recent experimental studies on important cell functions, such as adhesion and processing of environmental cues for decision-making, support the suggestion that it should be rewarding to complement standard binding properties such as affinity and kinetic constants, or even force dependence, with less frequently used parameters such as conformational flexibility or size of binding molecules.37868402<SEP>Fnu Nageeta<SEP>Precision Medicine Approaches to Diabetic Kidney Disease: Personalized Interventions on the Horizon<SEP>Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a significant complication of diabetes that requires innovative interventions to address its increasing impact. Precision medicine is a rapidly emerging paradigm that shows excellent promise in tailoring therapeutic strategies to the unique profiles of individual patients. This abstract examines the potential of precision medicine in managing DKD. It explores the genetic and molecular foundations, identifies biomarkers for risk assessment, provides insights into pharmacogenomics, and discusses targeted therapies. Integrating omics data and data analytics provides a comprehensive landscape for making informed decisions. The abstract highlights the difficulties encountered during the clinical implementation process, the ethical factors to be considered, and the importance of involving patients. In addition, it showcases case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of precision-based interventions. As the field progresses, the abstract anticipates a future characterized by the integration of artificial intelligence in diagnostics and treatment. It highlights the significant impact that precision medicine can have in revolutionizing the provision of care for DKD.38157465<SEP>Giovanni Annuzzi<SEP>Exploring Nutritional Influence on Blood Glucose Forecasting for Type 1 Diabetes Using Explainable AI<SEP>Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by insulin deficiency and blood sugar control issues. The state-of-the-art solution is the artificial pancreas (AP), which integrates basal insulin delivery and glucose monitoring. However, APs are unable to manage postprandial glucose response (PGR) due to limited knowledge of its determinants, requiring additional information for accurate bolus delivery, such as estimated carbohydrate intake. This study aims to quantify the influence of various meal-related factors on predicting postprandial blood glucose levels (BGLs) at different time intervals (15 min, 60 min, and 120 min) after meals by using deep neural network (DNN) models. The prediction models incorporate preprandial blood glucose values, insulin dosage, and various meal-related nutritional factors such as intake of energy, carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, fatty acids, fibers, glycemic index, and glycemic load as input variables. The impact of input features was assessed by exploiting eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies, specifically SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which provide insights into each feature's contribution to the model predictions. By leveraging XAI methodologies, this study aims to enhance the interpretability and transparency of BGL prediction models and validate clinical literature hypotheses. The findings can aid in the development of decision-support tools for individuals with T1DM, facilitating PGR management and reducing the risks of adverse events. The improved understanding of PGR determinants may lead to advancements in AP technology and improve the overall quality of life for T1DM patients.",
    "answer": "Sedentary living and a high-sugar diet can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes through multiple mechanisms. \n\n1. **Insulin Resistance**: A sedentary lifestyle can lead to insulin resistance, where the body's cells become less responsive to insulin. This means that glucose is not effectively taken up by cells, leading to elevated blood sugar levels over time. Similarly, a high-sugar diet can cause persistent high levels of glucose in the blood, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n\n2. **Weight Gain**: Sedentary living and a diet high in sugar can also contribute to weight gain and obesity. Excess body weight is closely linked to the development of type 2 diabetes as it further exacerbates insulin resistance and leads to chronic inflammation, both key components in diabetes development.\n\n3. **Inflammation**: Both sedentary living and a high-sugar diet can promote inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes as it can disrupt insulin signaling and overall metabolic function.\n\n4. **Oxidative Stress**: A high-sugar diet can contribute to oxidative stress in the body, which can impair the functioning of beta cells in the pancreas responsible for producing insulin. This can further contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes.\n\nOverall, adopting a more active lifestyle and a balanced diet low in sugar can help mitigate the risk factors associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. It is important to consider these lifestyle factors in conjunction with genetic predispositions and other health parameters when assessing diabetes risk and developing personalized interventions.",

    "context": "30660750<SEP>Karen Spruyt<SEP>A review of developmental consequences of poor sleep in childhood<SEP>Sleep is a fairly diverse and complex construct to operationalize in a scientific and naturalistic context. We report a systematic review and meta-analysis of reviews published in the last 5 years on poor sleep and developmental outcomes. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 42 articles (or 1117 studies) qualified. They reported outcomes related to poor sleep investigated as sleep disorders (38.1%), sleep 'in general' (26.2%), sleep duration (23.8%), in terms of circadian rhythm (4.8%), intra-individual variability (2.4%), and napping (2.4%). Sleep was primarily subjectively reported (30.2%), yet the methodology of sleep assessment was often neither tabulated nor discussed. Overall, most papers had a health-scope, being primarily weight problems expressed as body mass index. Its relationship with performance was measured with the Wechsler intelligence tests, the child behavior checklist and the continuous performance test, whereas meta-analytic papers specifically focused on cognition with sleep disorder (i.e. sleep-disordered breathing; 38.6%), on health (i.e. weight) with sleep duration (25%) and behavior with sleep 'in general' (15.9%), having a high true variance. Nevertheless, an aggregated effect size d of 0.35 (95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.42) suggests that poor sleep is moderately affecting a child's performance and health. In conclusion, poor sleep can no longer be disregarded, yet methodologies that are more rigorous and a scope beyond health may foster a better understanding of the role of (poor) sleep across childhood neurodevelopment.23372271<SEP>Alex Chatburn<SEP>Sleep spindle activity and cognitive performance in healthy children<SEP>Study objectives: To investigate the association between indices of sleep spindle activity and cognitive performance in a sample of healthy children. Design: Correlational. Intelligence (Stanford-Binet) and neurocognitive functioning (NEPSY) were assessed, with sleep variables being measured during overnight polysomnography. Setting: Hospital sleep laboratory. Participants: Twenty-seven healthy children (mean age 8.19 y; 14 female, 13 male). Interventions: N/A. Measurements and results: Participants underwent a single night of overnight polysomnography after completing measures of intelligence and neurocognitive functioning. Sleep spindles were visually identified by an experienced sleep scoring technician and separated algorithmically into fast (> 13 Hz) and slow spindle (< 13 Hz) categories. The number of fast spindles was significantly correlated with narrative memory (r(s) = 0.38) and sensorimotor functioning (-0.43). Mean central frequency of spindles was also significantly correlated with sensorimotor functioning (-0.41), planning ability (-0.41), and working memory (-0.54). Conclusions: Basal sleep spindle activity is associated with different aspects of cognitive performance in children. To the extent that these associations in a pediatric population are different from what is known in adult sleep may play an important role in development.24424102<SEP>Domenico M Romeo<SEP>Sleep disorders in children with cerebral palsy: neurodevelopmental and behavioral correlates<SEP>Objectives: We aimed to estimate the frequency of sleep disorders in children with cerebral palsy (CP) using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) and to evaluate the relations between sleep disorders and motor, cognitive, and behavioral problems. Methods: One hundred and sixty-five children with CP ages 6-16 years (mean age, 11years) were assessed using the SDSC, the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) to assess sleep, motor, cognitive, and behavioral problems, respectively. Results: An abnormal total sleep score was found in 19% of children with CP; more than 40% of children had an abnormal score on at least one SDSC factor. The SDSC total score was significantly associated (P<.01) with mental retardation, epilepsy, CBCL scores, and level 5 on the GMFCS. Conclusions: Our results confirm that sleep disorders are common in children with cerebral palsy. The relationship between motor and cognitive behavior and epilepsy should be further explored to better understand how these factors influence one another to identify effective treatments and to improve the well-being of the child.26803843<SEP>Desana Kocevska<SEP>Early Childhood Sleep Patterns and Cognitive Development at Age 6 Years: The Generation R Study<SEP>Objective: To explore the association of sleep duration and awakening frequency with cognitive outcomes in young children. Methods: Mothers of 2,800 children from the Generation R cohort reported sleep duration and awakenings at children's age 24 months. At age 6 years, validated Dutch measures were used to assess children's nonverbal intelligence and language comprehension. Results: We found a nonlinear association of total sleep time at 24 months with nonverbal intelligence ( p = 0.03) and language comprehension ( p = 0.04) at 6 years. Toddlers sleeping within the recommended 11-14 hr had more favorable cognitive development compared with both extremes. Frequent awakenings were negatively associated with nonverbal intelligence, but not with verbal comprehension. Conclusion: Sleep duration in toddlerhood has an inverted-U-shaped relation with childhood cognitive measures. Frequent awakenings are associated with lower nonverbal intelligence. Given the marked decline in sleep duration and awakenings in toddlerhood, developmental changes of sleep patterns might be important for cognitive development.",

Furthermore, severe COVID-19 is often accompanied by a cytokine storm and a disrupted response of the adaptive immune system. Studies aiming to depict this dysregulation have mostly investigated the peripheral cell count as well as the functionality of immune cells. We investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on antigen-presenting cells using multiplexed immunofluorescence. Similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be impairing the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). DC maturation involves a switch in surface antigen expression, which enables the cells' homing to lymph nodes and the subsequent activation of T-cells. As quantitative descriptions of the local inflammatory infiltrate are still scarce, we compared the cell population of professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) in the lungs of COVID-19 autopsy cases in different stages of DAD. We found an increased count of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) in later stages. Interestingly, mDCs also showed no significant upregulation of maturation markers in DAD-specimens with high viral load. Accumulation of immature mDCs, which are unable to home to lymph nodes, ultimately results in an inadequate T-cell response.34745097<SEP>Arvinpreet Kaur<SEP>The Omic Insights on Unfolding Saga of COVID-19<SEP>The year 2019 has seen an emergence of the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Since the onset of the pandemic, biological and interdisciplinary research is being carried out across the world at a rapid pace to beat the pandemic. There is an increased need to comprehensively understand various aspects of the virus from detection to treatment options including drugs and vaccines for effective global management of the disease. In this review, we summarize the salient findings pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 biology, including symptoms, hosts, epidemiology, SARS-CoV-2 genome, and its emerging variants, viral diagnostics, host-pathogen interactions, alternative antiviral strategies and application of machine learning heuristics and artificial intelligence for effective management of COVID-19 and future pandemics.37370601<SEP>Kritika Srinivasan Rajsri<SEP>Simultaneous Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 Antigen and Host Antibody Detection and Pre-Screening Strategy at the Point of Care<SEP>As COVID-19 pandemic public health measures are easing globally, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 strains continue to present high risk for vulnerable populations. The antibody-mediated protection acquired from vaccination and/or infection is seen to wane over time and the immunocompromised populations can no longer expect benefit from monoclonal antibody prophylaxis. Hence, there is a need to monitor new variants and its effect on vaccine performance. In this context, surveillance of new SARS-CoV-2 infections and serology testing are gaining consensus for use as screening methods, especially for at-risk groups. Here, we described an improved COVID-19 screening strategy, comprising predictive algorithms and concurrent, rapid, accurate, and quantitative SARS-CoV-2 antigen and host antibody testing strategy, at point of care (POC). We conducted a retrospective analysis of 2553 pre- and asymptomatic patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. The pre-screening model had an AUC (CI) of 0.76 (0.73-0.78). Despite being the default method for screening, body temperature had lower AUC (0.52 [0.49-0.55]) compared to case incidence rate (0.65 [0.62-0.68]).

Artificial intelligence (AI) scientists are developing several intelligent computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools in multiple imaging modalities, i.e., lung computed tomography (CT), chest X-rays, and lung ultrasounds. These AI tools assist the pulmonary and critical care clinicians through (a) faster detection of the presence of a virus, (b) classifying pneumonia types, and (c) measuring the severity of viral damage in COVID-19-infected patients. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to fully understand the requirements of for a fast and successful, and timely lung scans analysis. This narrative review first presents the pathological layout of the lungs in the COVID-19 scenario, followed by understanding and then explains the comorbid statistical distributions in the ARDS framework. The novelty of this review is the approach to classifying the AI models as per the by school of thought (SoTs), exhibiting based on segregation of techniques and their characteristics. The study also discusses the identification of AI models and its extension from non-ARDS lungs (pre-COVID-19) to ARDS lungs (post-COVID-19). Furthermore, it also presents AI workflow considerations of for medical imaging modalities in the COVID-19 framework. Finally, clinical AI design considerations will be discussed. We conclude that the design of the current existing AI models can be improved by considering comorbidity as an independent factor. Furthermore, ARDS post-processing clinical systems must involve include (i) the clinical validation and verification of AI-models, (ii) reliability and stability criteria, and (iii) easily adaptable, and (iv) generalization assessments of AI systems for their use in pulmonary, critical care, and radiological settings.",
    "answer": "Chronic stress can have a significant impact on the immune system, potentially increasing susceptibility to illness. One of the ways chronic stress can affect the immune system is by leading to dysregulation of the immune response, as seen in severe COVID-19 cases. For example, studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, impairs the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), which are crucial for activating T-cells and mounting an effective immune response. In the context of COVID-19, impaired DC maturation could result in an inadequate T-cell response, ultimately affecting the ability of the immune system to combat the viral infection. Additionally, chronic stress may also exacerbate inflammation and disrupt the balance of immune cells, further compromising the body's ability to fight off infections. Overall, chronic stress can weaken the immune system and make individuals more vulnerable to illnesses by impacting various aspects of immune function, including antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and overall immune response coordination.",

    "question": "What is the relationship between hypertension and kidney disease?",
    "context": "36878233<SEP>Kristina Boss<SEP>[Staging of kidney disease today and tomorrow]<SEP>Since September 2022, there is a new, German-language glossary for the nomenclature of renal function and renal disease, aligned with international technical terms and KDIGO guidelines for a more precise and uniform description of the facts. Terms such as \"renal disease,\" \"renal insufficiency,\" or \"acute renal failure\" should be avoided and replaced with \"disease\" or \"functional impairment.\"The KDIGO guideline recommends in patients with CKD stage G3a, in addition to the determination of serum creatinine, the additional determination of cystatin to confirm the CKD stage. A combination of serum creatinine and cystatin C to estimate GFR without taking into account the so-called race coefficient seems to be more accurate in African Americans than the previous eGFR formulas. However, there is no recommendation on this in international guidelines yet. For Caucasians, the formula does not change.Renal function impairment lasting more than 7 days but less than 3 months is called acute kidney disease (AKD). The AKD stage is the critical time window for therapeutic interventions to reduce the risk of progression in kidney disease.A future, expanded AKI definition incorporating biomarkers will allow patients to be divided into subclasses according to functional and structural limitations, thus mapping the two-dimensionality of AKI. By using artificial intelligence, large amounts of data from clinical parameters, blood and urine samples, histopathological and molecular markers (including proteomics and metabolomics data) can be used integratively for the graduation of CKD and thus contribute significantly to individualized therapy.34236337<SEP>Xia Jing<SEP>The Unified Medical Language System at 30 Years and How It Is Used and Published: Systematic Review and Content Analysis<SEP>Background: The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) has been a critical tool in biomedical and health informatics, and the year 2021 marks its 30th anniversary. The UMLS brings together many broadly used vocabularies and standards in the biomedical field to facilitate interoperability among different computer systems and applications. Objective: Despite its longevity, there is no comprehensive publication analysis of the use of the UMLS. Thus, this review and analysis is conducted to provide an overview of the UMLS and its use in English-language peer-reviewed publications, with the objective of providing a comprehensive understanding of how the UMLS has been used in English-language peer-reviewed publications over the last 30 years. Methods: PubMed, ACM Digital Library, and the Nursing & Allied Health Database were used to search for studies. The primary search strategy was as follows: UMLS was used as a Medical Subject Headings term or a keyword or appeared in the title or abstract. Only English-language publications were considered. The publications were screened first, then coded and categorized iteratively, following the grounded theory. The review process followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Results: A total of 943 publications were included in the final analysis. Moreover, 32 publications were categorized into 2 categories; hence the total number of publications before duplicates are removed is 975. After analysis and categorization of the publications, UMLS was found to be used in the following emerging themes or areas (the number of publications and their respective percentages are given in parentheses): natural language processing (230/975, 23.6%), information retrieval (125/975, 12.8%), terminology study (90/975, 9.2%), ontology and modeling (80/975, 8.2%), medical subdomains (76/975, 7.8%), other language studies (53/975, 5.4%), artificial intelligence tools and applications (46/975, 4.7%), patient care (35/975, 3.6%), data mining and knowledge discovery (25/975, 2.6%), medical education (20/975, 2.1%), degree-related theses (13/975, 1.3%), digital library (5/975, 0.5%), and the UMLS itself (150/975, 15.4%), as well as the UMLS for other purposes (27/975, 2.8%). Conclusions: The UMLS has been used successfully in patient care, medical education, digital libraries, and software development, as originally planned, as well as in degree-related theses, the building of artificial intelligence tools, data mining and knowledge discovery, foundational work in methodology, and middle layers that may lead to advanced products. Natural language processing, the UMLS itself, and information retrieval are the 3 most common themes that emerged among the included publications. The results, although largely related to academia, demonstrate that UMLS achieves its intended uses successfully, in addition to achieving uses broadly beyond its original intentions.28787724<SEP>Kimberly Harding<SEP>Current State and Future Trends to Optimize the Care of African Americans with End-Stage Renal Disease<SEP>Background: Chronic kidney disease is a progressive disease, which terminates in end-stage renal diseases (ESRD) that requires either dialysis or kidney transplantation for the patient to survive. There is an alarming trend in the disparities of ESRD in African Americans (AAs). Currently, AAs represent more than 30% of incident ESRD cases, yet they constitute 15% of the overall US population. Despite the reductions in mortality, increases in access to patient-centered home dialysis and preemptive kidney transplantation for the overall US ESRD population over the last decade, disparities in the care of AAs with ESRD remain largely unaffected. Summary: This review discusses patient-, community-, and practitioner-related factors that contribute to disparities in ESRD care for AAs. In particular, the review addresses issues related to end-of-life support, the importance of Apolipoprotein-1 gene variants, and the advent of pharmacogenomics toward achieving precision care. The need for accessible clinical intelligence for the ESRD population is discussed. Several interventions and a call to action to address the disparities are presented. Key Messages: Significant disparities in ESRD care exist for AAs. Strategies to enhance patient engagement, education, accountable partnerships, and clinical intelligence may reduce these disparities.30582197<SEP>Nasrien E Ibrahim<SEP>A clinical, proteomics, and artificial intelligence-driven model to predict acute kidney injury in patients undergoing coronary angiography<SEP>Background: Standard measures of kidney function are only modestly useful for accurate prediction of risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). Hypothesis: Clinical and biomarker data can predict AKI more accurately. Methods: Using Luminex xMAP technology, we measured 109 biomarkers in blood from 889 patients prior to undergoing coronary angiography. Procedural AKI was defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine of \u22650.3 mg/dL, a percentage increase in serum creatinine of \u226550%, or a reduction in urine output (documented oliguria of <0.5 mL/kg per hour for >6 hours) within 7 days after contrast exposure. Clinical and biomarker predictors of AKI were identified using machine learning and a final prognostic model was developed with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Results: Forty-three (4.8%) patients developed procedural AKI. Six predictors were present in the final model: four (history of diabetes, blood urea nitrogen to creatinine ratio, C-reactive protein, and osteopontin) had a positive association with AKI risk, while two (CD5 antigen-like and Factor VII) had a negative association with AKI risk. The final model had a cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.79 for predicting procedural AKI, and an in-sample AUC of 0.82 (P < 0.001). The optimal score cutoff had 77% sensitivity, 75% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 98% for procedural AKI. An elevated score was predictive of procedural AKI in all subjects (odds ratio = 9.87; P < 0.001). Conclusions: We describe a clinical and proteomics-supported biomarker model with high accuracy for predicting procedural AKI in patients undergoing coronary angiography.",
    "answer": "The relationship between hypertension and kidney disease is significant, as hypertension is a known risk factor for the development and progression of kidney disease. Hypertension can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to decreased kidney function over time. Additionally, hypertension can also exacerbate existing kidney disease, leading to further complications. It is essential for individuals with hypertension to manage their blood pressure effectively to help prevent or slow down the progression of kidney disease. Treatment for hypertension often includes lifestyle modifications and medications to control blood pressure levels and reduce the strain on the kidneys. Regular monitoring and management of both hypertension and kidney function are crucial in preventing complications and maintaining overall health.",

Nevertheless, inactivity is a worldwide pandemic, and methods to augment exercise benefits are required. The constrained disorder principle (CDP) characterizes biological systems based on their inherent variability. We aimed to investigate the association between intra-individual variability in PA and disability among non-athlete adults. Methods: In this retrospective analysis of the longitudinal SHARE survey, we included non-disabled adults aged >50 with at least six visits over 14 years. Self-reported PA frequency was documented bi- to triennially. Low PA intensity was defined as vigorous PA frequency less than once a week. Stable PA was described as an unchanged PA intensity in all consecutive middle observations. The primary outcome was defined as a physical limitation in everyday activities at the end of the survey. Secondary outcomes were cognitive functions, including short-term memory, long-term memory, and verbal fluency. Results: The study included 2,049 non-disabled adults with a mean age of 53 and 49.1 % women. In the initially high PA intensity group, variability in PA was associated with increased physical disability prevalence (23.3% vs. 33.2%, stablevs. unstablePA; P37623270<SEP>Noa Hurvitz<SEP>The Constrained-Disorder Principle Assists in Overcoming Significant Challenges in Digital Health: Moving from \"Nice to Have\" to Mandatory Systems<SEP>The success of artificial intelligence depends on whether it can penetrate the boundaries of evidence-based medicine, the lack of policies, and the resistance of medical professionals to its use. The failure of digital health to meet expectations requires rethinking some of the challenges faced. We discuss some of the most significant challenges faced by patients, physicians, payers, pharmaceutical companies, and health systems in the digital world. The goal of healthcare systems is to improve outcomes. Assisting in diagnosing, collecting data, and simplifying processes is a \"nice to have\" tool, but it is not essential. Many of these systems have yet to be shown to improve outcomes. Current outcome-based expectations and economic constraints make \"nice to have,\" \"assists,\" and \"ease processes\" insufficient. Complex biological systems are defined by their inherent disorder, bounded by dynamic boundaries, as described by the constrained disorder principle (CDP). It provides a platform for correcting systems' malfunctions by regulating their degree of variability. A CDP-based second-generation artificial intelligence system provides solutions to some challenges digital health faces. Therapeutic interventions are held to improve outcomes with these systems. In addition to improving clinically meaningful endpoints, CDP-based second-generation algorithms ensure patient and physician engagement and reduce the health system's costs.27072928<SEP>M van Schijndel-Speet<SEP>A structured physical activity and fitness programme for older adults with intellectual disabilities: results of a cluster-randomised clinical trial<SEP>Background: The physical activity level of older adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) is extremely low, and their fitness levels are far beneath accepted norms for older people with normal intelligence and comparable with frail older people. A physical activity programme, including an education programme, was developed for older adults with ID using behaviour change techniques. The programme aimed at improving or maintaining adequate levels of physical activity (primary outcome measure) and motor fitness, cardio respiratory fitness, morphologic and metabolic fitness, activities of daily living, cognitive functioning and depressive symptoms (secondary outcome measures). Method: The programme's efficacy was evaluated in a cluster-randomised clinical trial among people aged 43 years and over with mild-moderate levels of ID. Five day-activity centres were randomised to the participation group. In these centres, 81 older adults participated in groups of 8 to 10 in the programme, three times a week during 8 months. The programme was executed by physical activity instructors and staff of day-activity centres. Five other day-activity centres were randomised to the control group; 70 older adults in these centres received care as usual. The generalised linear model with mixed effects was used to test the programme's effectiveness. Results: Significant effects were found on physical activity, muscle strength, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol level and cognitive functioning, in favour of the programme's participants. No significant improvements were found on balance, serum glucose, weight, waist circumference, walking speed, mobility, depression or instrumental activities of daily living. Conclusions: The physical activity and fitness programme has established small but significant effects in this sample, but generalising the findings to other settings is difficult due to significant participant dropout. Implementation of evidence-based physical activity programmes among older adults with ID is recommended. Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of physical activity on daily life functioning and the development on chronic diseases in the long run.27752537<SEP>Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez-Benavides<SEP>Modeling practice effects in healthy middle-aged participants of the Alzheimer and Families parent cohort<SEP>Introduction: Repetitive administration of neuropsychological tests can lead to performance improvement merely due to previous exposure. The magnitude of such practice effects (PEs) may be used as a marker of subtle cognitive impairment because they are diminished in healthy individuals subsequently developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: To explore the relationship between sociodemographic factors, AD family history (FH), and APOE \u03b54 status, and the magnitude of PE, four subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV were administered twice to 400 middle-aged healthy individuals, most of them first-degree descendants of AD patients. Results: PEs were observed in all measures. Sociodemographic variables did not show a uniform effect on PE. Baseline score was the strongest predictor of change, being inversely related to PE magnitude. Significant effects of the interaction term APOE \u03b54\u2217Age in processing speed and working memory were observed. Discussion: PEs exert a relevant effect in cognitive outcomes at retest and, accordingly, they must be taken into consideration in clinical trials. The magnitude of PE in processing speed and working memory could be of special interest for the development of cognitive markers of preclinical AD.",
    "answer": "Untreated mental health disorders can have a significant impact on physical health over time. The context provided highlights the importance of regular physical activity in promoting mental and physical health, as well as the potential consequences of inactivity. \n\nThe study mentioned in the context specifically explores the association between intra-individual variability in physical activity (PA) and disability among non-athlete adults. It found that variability in PA was associated with increased physical disability prevalence, indicating that inconsistent or unstable levels of physical activity can contribute to physical limitations in everyday activities over time.\n\nTherefore, it can be inferred that untreated mental health disorders, which may affect motivation, energy levels, and overall well-being, could lead to inconsistent or decreased levels of physical activity. This, in turn, can contribute to physical health problems and disabilities developing or worsening over time. \n\nIn summary, untreated mental health disorders can indirectly impact physical health by influencing behaviors such as physical activity, which play a crucial role in maintaining overall health and well-being. It is important to address mental health issues to prevent potential negative consequences on physical health in the long term.",

Many individuals who develop problematic opioid use (POU) do so after being exposed to prescribed opioid analgesics. Therefore, it is important to accurately identify and classify risk factors for POU. In this review, we discuss the etiology of POU and highlight novel approaches to identifying its risk factors. These approaches include the application of polygenic risk scores (PRS) and diverse machine learning (ML) algorithms used in tandem with data from electronic health records (EHR), clinical notes, patient demographics, and digital footprints. The implementation and synergy of these types of data and approaches can greatly assist in reducing the incidence of POU and opioid-related mortality by increasing the knowledge base of patient-related risk factors, which can help to improve prescribing practices for opioid analgesics.37428897<SEP>Duncan C McElfresh<SEP>A call for better validation of opioid overdose risk algorithms<SEP>Clinical decision support (CDS) systems powered by predictive models have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of clinical decision-making. However, without sufficient validation, these systems have the potential to mislead clinicians and harm patients. This is especially true for CDS systems used by opioid prescribers and dispensers, where a flawed prediction can directly harm patients. To prevent these harms, regulators and researchers have proposed guidance for validating predictive models and CDS systems. However, this guidance is not universally followed and is not required by law. We call on CDS developers, deployers, and users to hold these systems to higher standards of clinical and technical validation. We provide a case study on two CDS systems deployed on a national scale in the United States for predicting a patient's risk of adverse opioid-related events: the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation (STORM), used by the Veterans Health Administration, and NarxCare, a commercial system.37147078<SEP>Yining Lu<SEP>Editorial Commentary: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Are Tools Requiring Physician and Patient Input When Screening Patients at Risk for Extended, Postoperative Opioid Use<SEP>As the implementation of artificial intelligence in orthopedic surgery research flourishes, so grows the need for responsible use. Related research requires clear reporting of algorithmic error rates. Recent studies show that preoperative opioid use, male sex, and greater body mass index are risk factors for extended, postoperative opioid use, but may result in high false positive rates. Thus, to be applied clinically when screening patients, these tools require physician and patient input, and nuanced interpretation, as the utility of these screening tools diminish without providers interpreting and acting on the information. Machine learning and artificial intelligence should be viewed as tools that can facilitate these human conversations among patients, orthopedic surgeons, and health care providers.36103036<SEP>Pishoy Gouda<SEP>Harnessing Electronic Medical Records in Cardiovascular Clinical Practice and Research<SEP>The use of electronic medical records has rapidly been adopted world-wide, which has resulted in multiple new opportunities for cardiovascular research.

Interestingly, their goals and processes appear to be distant from each other; however, their physiological mechanisms keep notorious similarities. Both construct intelligence, learn from experience, and keep memory. Their precise responses to innumerable stimuli are delicately modulated, and the exposure of the individual to thousands of potential challenges integrates their functionality; they use a large part of their constituents not in excitatory activities but in the maintenance of inhibitory mechanisms to keep silent vast intrinsic potentialities. The nervous and immune systems are integrated by a basic cell lineage (neurons and lymphocytes, respectively) but each embodies countless cell subgroups with different and specialized deeds which, in contrast with cells from other organs, labyrinthine molecular arrangements conduct to \"one cell, one function\". Also, nervous and immune actions confer identity that differentiates every individual from countless others in the same species. Both systems regulate and potentiate their responses aided by countless biological resources of variable intensity: hormones, peptides, cytokines, pro-inflammatory molecules, etc. How the immune and the nervous systems buildup memory, learning capability, and exquisite control of excitatory/inhibitory mechanisms constitute major intellectual challenges for contemporary research.34065617<SEP>Adriana Tomic<SEP>Systems Immunology: Revealing Influenza Immunological Imprint<SEP>Understanding protective influenza immunity and identifying immune correlates of protection poses a major challenge and requires an appreciation of the immune system in all of its complexity. While adaptive immune responses such as neutralizing antibodies and influenza-specific T lymphocytes are contributing to the control of influenza virus, key factors of long-term protection are not well defined. Using systems immunology, an approach that combines experimental and computational methods, we can capture the systems-level state of protective immunity and reveal the essential pathways that are involved. New approaches and technological developments in systems immunology offer an opportunity to examine roles and interrelationships of clinical, biological, and genetic factors in the control of influenza infection and have the potential to lead to novel discoveries about influenza immunity that are essential for the development of more effective vaccines to prevent future pandemics. Here, we review recent developments in systems immunology that help to reveal key factors mediating protective immunity.37484195<SEP>Daniel Mendelson<SEP>C-Reactive protein and cognition: Mediation analyses with brain morphology in the UK Biobank<SEP>Cognitive impairments and abnormal immune activity are both associated with various clinical disorders. The association between C-Reactive protein (CRP), a marker associated with inflammation, and cognitive performance remains unclear. Further, mechanisms potentially linking CRP to cognition are not yet established. Brain structure may well mediate this relationship: immune processes play crucial roles in shaping and maintaining brain structure, with brain structure and function driving cognition. The United Kingdom Biobank (UKBB) is a large cohort study with extensive assessments, including high-sensitivity serum CRP levels, brain imaging, and various cognitive tasks. With data from 39,200 UKBB participants, we aimed first to determine the relationship between CRP and cognitive performance, and second, to assess metrics of brain morphology as potential mediators in this relationship. Participants were aged 40 to 70 at initial assessment and were mostly Caucasian. After accounting for potential covariates (e.g., age, sex, medical diagnoses, use of selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors), we found CRP levels to have small, negative associations with fluid intelligence (b = -0.03, 95%CI[-0.05,-0.02], t(14381) = -3.62, pcor = .004), and numeric memory (b = -0.03, 95%CI[-0.05,-0.01], t(14366) = -3.31, pcor = .007). We found no evidence of brain morphology mediating these relationships (all |ab| < 0.001, all pcor > .55). Our findings from this large sample suggest that serum-assessed CRP is of marginal importance for cognitive performance in mid-to-late aged Caucasians; the small effect sizes of statistically significant associations provide context to previous inconsistent results. The seeming lack of involvement of brain morphology suggests that other brain metrics (e.g., connectivity, functional activation) may be more pertinent to this relationship. Future work should also consider CRP levels measured in the central nervous system and/or other cytokines that may better predict cognitive performance in this population.31635492<SEP>Yesica Aydmune<SEP>Inhibitory Processes Training for School-age Children: Transfer Effects<SEP>Inhibition refers to a basic executive component that can be conceptualized as consisted of different inhibitory processes (i.e., perceptual, cognitive and response inhibition). These processes emerge during the first years of life, and since then are involved in different relevant every day activities. Different individual and contextual factors can modulate their developmental trajectories. The possibility of train in separate ways each inhibitory process is a subject of analysis. In such a context, the aims of this work were: (a) to design, implement and evaluate training of perceptual, cognitive and response inhibition processes, in a sample of school-aged children (6 to 8 years old); and (b) to analyze near, far, short- and long-transfer effects. An experimental design with three training groups (one for each inhibitory process) and an active control group was implemented. Near transfer effects were not observed. We found effects on a visuospatial working memory task in the short term, after the training in the response and cognitive inhibition, and effects on a fluid intelligence task in both the short and long term after the training in cognitive inhibition. The results contribute to a conceptualization of multidimensional inhibitory processes and the plausibility of training them during childhood.",
    "answer": "The immune response to vaccination differs from that to an actual infection in several ways. When a person receives a vaccine, it typically contains a weakened or inactive form of the virus or bacteria that the immune system recognizes as foreign. This triggers the immune system to produce a response, including the production of antibodies and memory cells, without causing the person to become sick. This response is often milder compared to when the person is actually infected with the full-strength pathogen. \n\nIn contrast, an actual infection involves the body being exposed to the full-strength pathogen, leading to a more robust and potentially harmful immune response. This can result in symptoms of illness as the immune system works to eliminate the pathogen from the body. \n\nOverall, the immune response to vaccination is a controlled and pre-emptive way to prepare the immune system to recognize and fight off a specific pathogen, while the immune response to an actual infection is a reactive and potentially more severe response to a pathogen that has already invaded the body.",

Methods: The engines MEDLINE, Embase Classic+Embase, APA PsycInfo, and SCOPUS were searched up to May 2022. Our inclusion criteria focus on the following pollutants: particulate matter, NOx, and ozone. The cognitive abilities of interest are: general/global cognition, executive function, attention, working memory, learning, memory, intelligence and IQ, reasoning, reaction times, and processing speed. The collective evidence was assessed using the NTP-OHAT framework and random-effects meta-analyses. Results: Eighty-six studies were identified, the results of which were generally supportive of associations between exposures and worsened cognition, but the literature was varied and sometimes contradictory. There was moderate certainty support for detrimental associations between PM2.5 and general cognition in adults 40+, and PM2.5, NOx, and PM10 and executive function (especially working memory) in children. There was moderate certainty evidence against associations between ozone and general cognition in adults age 40+, and NOx and reasoning/IQ in children. Some associations were also supported by meta-analysis (N = 14 studies, all in adults aged 40+). A 1 \u03bcg/m3 increase in NO2 was associated with reduced performance on general cognitive batteries (\u03b2 = -0.02, p < 0.05) as was a 1 \u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure (\u03b2 = -0.02, p < 0.05). A 1\u03bcgm3 increase in PM2.5 was significantly associated with lower verbal fluency by -0.05 words (p = 0.01) and a decrease in executive function task performance of -0.02 points (p < 0.001).

Objectives: We investigated these associations using more refined exposure assessments in 1,967 mother-child dyads from three U.S. pregnancy cohorts in six cities in the ECHO-PATHWAYS Consortium. Methods: Pre- and postnatal nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) \u22642.5\u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) exposures were derived from an advanced spatiotemporal model. Child behavior was reported as Total Problems raw score using the Child Behavior Checklist at age 4-6 y. Child cognition was assessed using cohort-specific cognitive performance scales and quantified as the Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ). We fitted multivariate linear regression models that were adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychological factors to estimate associations per 2-unit increase in pollutant in each exposure window and examined modification by child sex. Identified critical windows were further verified by distributed lag models (DLMs). Results: Mean NO2 and PM2.5 ranged from 8.4 to 9.0 ppb and 8.4 to 9.1 \u03bcg/m3, respectively, across pre- and postnatal windows. Average child Total Problems score and IQ were 22.7 [standard deviation (SD): 18.5] and 102.6 (SD: 15.3), respectively. Children with higher prenatal NO2 exposures were likely to have more behavioral problems [\u03b2: 1.24; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.39, 2.08; per 2 ppb NO2], particularly NO2 in the first and second trimester. Each 2-\u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5 at age 2-4 y was associated with a 3.59 unit (95% CI: 0.35, 6.84) higher Total Problems score and a 2.63 point (95% CI: -5.08, -0.17) lower IQ. The associations between PM2.5 and Total Problems score were generally stronger in girls. Most predefined windows identified were not confirmed by DLMs. Discussion: Our study extends earlier findings that have raised concerns about impaired behavioral functioning and cognitive performance in children exposed to NO2 and PM2.5 in utero and in early life. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10248.35839913<SEP>Michelle S W Kusters<SEP>Air pollution exposure during pregnancy and childhood, cognitive function, and emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents<SEP>Background: Exposure to air pollution may impact neurodevelopment during childhood, but current evidence on the association with cognitive function and mental health is inconclusive and primarily focusses on young children. Therefore, we aim to study the association of exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and childhood, with cognitive function and emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents. Methods: We used data from 5170 participants of a birth cohort in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Concentrations of fourteen air pollutants at participant's home addresses were estimated during pregnancy and childhood, using land use regression models. We included four cognitive domains (processing speed, working memory, fluid reasoning and verbal intelligence quotient (IQ)) and an estimated full-scale IQ. Internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems were self- and parent-reported. We used linear regression models to assess the association of each air pollutant, with cognitive function and emotional and behavioral problems, adjusting for socioeconomic status and lifestyle characteristics. Then, we performed multipollutant analyses using the Deletion/Substitution/Addition (DSA) algorithm. Results: Air pollution exposure was not associated with full-scale IQ, working memory, or processing speed. Higher exposure to few air pollutants was associated with higher fluid reasoning and verbal IQ scores (e.g. 0.22 points of fluid reasoning (95%CI 0.00; 0.44) per 1 \u03bcg/m3 increase in organic carbon during pregnancy). Higher exposure to some air pollutants was also associated with less internalizing, externalizing, and attention problems (e.g. -0.27 internalizing problems (95% CI -0.52; -0.02) per each 5 ng/m3 increase in copper during pregnancy). Conclusions: Higher exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and childhood was not associated with lower cognitive function or more emotional and behavioral problems in adolescents. Based on previous literature and biological plausibility, the observed protective associations are probably explained by negative residual confounding, selection bias, or chance and do not represent a causal relationship.28686749<SEP>Narendra K Arora<SEP>Setting research priorities for maternal, newborn, child health and nutrition in India by engaging experts from 256 indigenous institutions contributing over 4000 research ideas: a CHNRI exercise by ICMR and INCLEN<SEP>Background: Health research in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) is often driven by donor priorities rather than by the needs of the countries where the research takes place. This lack of alignment of donor's priorities with local research need may be one of the reasons why countries fail to achieve set goals for population health and nutrition. India has a high burden of morbidity and mortality in women, children and infants. In order to look forward toward the Sustainable Development Goals, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the INCLEN Trust International (INCLEN) employed the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative's (CHNRI) research priority setting method for maternal, neonatal, child health and nutrition with the timeline of 2016-2025. The exercise was the largest to-date use of the CHNRI methodology, both in terms of participants and ideas generated and also expanded on the methodology. Methods: CHNRI is a crowdsourcing-based exercise that involves using the collective intelligence of a group of stakeholders, usually researchers, to generate and score research options against a set of criteria. This paper reports on a large umbrella CHNRI that was divided into four theme-specific CHNRIs (maternal, newborn, child health and nutrition). A National Steering Group oversaw the exercise and four theme-specific Research Sub-Committees technically supported finalizing the scoring criteria and refinement of research ideas for the respective thematic areas. The exercise engaged participants from 256 institutions across India - 4003 research ideas were generated from 498 experts which were consolidated into 373 research options (maternal health: 122; newborn health: 56; child health: 101; nutrition: 94); 893 experts scored these against five criteria (answerability, relevance, equity, innovation and out-of-box thinking, investment on research). Relative weights to the criteria were assigned by 79 members from the Larger Reference Group. Given India's diversity, priorities were identified at national and three regional levels: (i) the Empowered Action Group (EAG) and North-Eastern States; (ii) States and Union territories in Northern India (including West Bengal); and (iii) States and Union territories in Southern and Western parts of India. Conclusions: The exercise leveraged the inherent flexibility of the CHNRI method in multiple ways. It expanded on the CHNRI methodology enabling analyses for identification of research priorities at national and regional levels. However, prioritization of research options are only valuable if they are put to use, and we hope that donors will take advantage of this prioritized list of research options.",
    "answer": "The impact of environmental factors, such as air pollution, on respiratory health is well-documented in research literature. Studies have shown that exposure to pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone can have detrimental effects on respiratory health. For example, an increase in NO2 and PM2.5 exposure has been associated with reduced cognitive performance in adults, particularly in tasks related to general cognition, executive function, working memory, and verbal fluency.\n\nMoreover, research has also highlighted the adverse effects of air pollution on children's behavioral problems and cognitive performance. Higher prenatal exposure to NO2 and PM2.5 has been linked to increased behavioral problems in children, while exposure to these pollutants in early life may lead to impaired cognitive performance and lower IQ scores.\n\nOverall, these findings underscore the importance of addressing air pollution as a significant environmental factor that can impact respiratory health, cognitive function, and behavioral outcomes in both adults and children. Efforts to reduce air pollution levels and mitigate its effects are crucial for promoting overall health and well-being in populations exposed to polluted air.",

    "question": "How does obesity elevate the risk of other conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes?",
    "context": "37393408<SEP>Julia Mariel Wirtz Baker<SEP>Non-traditional data sources in obesity research: a systematic review of their use in the study of obesogenic environments<SEP>Background: The complex nature of obesity increasingly requires a comprehensive approach that includes the role of environmental factors. For understanding contextual determinants, the resources provided by technological advances could become a key factor in obesogenic environment research. This study aims to identify different sources of non-traditional data and their applications, considering the domains of obesogenic environments: physical, sociocultural, political and economic. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus and LILACS databases by two independent groups of reviewers, from September to December 2021. We included those studies oriented to adult obesity research using non-traditional data sources, published in the last 5 years in English, Spanish or Portuguese. The overall reporting followed the PRISMA guidelines. Results: The initial search yielded 1583 articles, 94 articles were kept for full-text screening, and 53 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included. We extracted information about countries of origin, study design, observation units, obesity-related outcomes, environment variables, and non-traditional data sources used. Our results revealed that most of the studies originated from high-income countries (86.54%) and used geospatial data within a GIS (76.67%), social networks (16.67%), and digital devices (11.66%) as data sources. Geospatial data were the most utilised data source and mainly contributed to the study of the physical domains of obesogenic environments, followed by social networks providing data to the analysis of the sociocultural domain. A gap in the literature exploring the political domain of environments was also evident. Conclusion: The disparities between countries are noticeable. Geospatial and social network data sources contributed to studying the physical and sociocultural environments, which could be a valuable complement to those traditionally used in obesity research. We propose the use of information available on the Internet, addressed by artificial intelligence-based tools, to increase the knowledge on political and economic dimensions of the obesogenic environment.33658039<SEP>Maged N Kamel Boulos<SEP>Smart city lifestyle sensing, big data, geo-analytics and intelligence for smarter public health decision-making in overweight, obesity and type 2 diabetes prevention: the research we should be doing<SEP>The public health burden caused by overweight, obesity (OO) and type-2 diabetes (T2D) is very significant and continues to rise worldwide. The causation of OO and T2D is complex and highly multifactorial rather than a mere energy intake (food) and expenditure (exercise) imbalance. But previous research into food and physical activity (PA) neighbourhood environments has mainly focused on associating body mass index (BMI) with proximity to stores selling fresh fruits and vegetables or fast food restaurants and takeaways, or with neighbourhood walkability factors and access to green spaces or public gym facilities, making largely naive, crude and inconsistent assumptions and conclusions that are far from the spirit of 'precision and accuracy public health'. Different people and population groups respond differently to the same food and PA environments, due to a myriad of unique individual and population group factors (genetic/epigenetic, metabolic, dietary and lifestyle habits, health literacy profiles, screen viewing times, stress levels, sleep patterns, environmental air and noise pollution levels, etc.) and their complex interplays with each other and with local food and PA settings. Furthermore, the same food store or fast food outlet can often sell or serve both healthy and non-healthy options/portions, so a simple binary classification into 'good' or 'bad' store/outlet should be avoided. Moreover, appropriate physical exercise, whilst essential for good health and disease prevention, is not very effective for weight maintenance or loss (especially when solely relied upon), and cannot offset the effects of a bad diet. The research we should be doing in the third decade of the twenty-first century should use a systems thinking approach, helped by recent advances in sensors, big data and related technologies, to investigate and consider all these factors in our quest to design better targeted and more effective public health interventions for OO and T2D control and prevention.33592164<SEP>Han Shi Jocelyn Chew<SEP>The potential of artificial intelligence in enhancing adult weight loss: a scoping review<SEP>Objective: To present an overview of how artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to regulate eating and dietary behaviours, exercise behaviours and weight loss. Design: A scoping review of global literature published from inception to 15 December 2020 was conducted according to Arksey and O'Malley's five-step framework. Eight databases (CINAHL, Cochrane-Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched. Included studies were independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers with good interrater reliability (k = 0\u00b796). Results: Sixty-six out of 5573 potential studies were included, representing more than 2031 participants. Three tenets of self-regulation were identified - self-monitoring (n 66, 100 %), optimisation of goal setting (n 10, 15\u00b72 %) and self-control (n 10, 15\u00b72 %). Articles were also categorised into three AI applications, namely machine perception (n 50), predictive analytics only (n 6) and real-time analytics with personalised micro-interventions (n 10). Machine perception focused on recognising food items, eating behaviours, physical activities and estimating energy balance. Predictive analytics focused on predicting weight loss, intervention adherence, dietary lapses and emotional eating. Studies on the last theme focused on evaluating AI-assisted weight management interventions that instantaneously collected behavioural data, optimised prediction models for behavioural lapse events and enhance behavioural self-control through adaptive and personalised nudges/prompts. Only six studies reported average weight losses (2\u00b74-4\u00b77 %) of which two were statistically significant. Conclusion: The use of AI for weight loss is still undeveloped. Based on the current study findings, we proposed a framework on the applicability of AI for weight loss but cautioned its contingency upon engagement and contextualisation.33870184<SEP>Guangzong Chen<SEP>Food/Non-Food Classification of Real-Life Egocentric Images in Low- and Middle-Income Countries Based on Image Tagging Features<SEP>Malnutrition, including both undernutrition and obesity, is a significant problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In order to study malnutrition and develop effective intervention strategies, it is crucial to evaluate nutritional status in LMICs at the individual, household, and community levels. In a multinational research project supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we have been using a wearable technology to conduct objective dietary assessment in sub-Saharan Africa. Our assessment includes multiple diet-related activities in urban and rural families, including food sources (e.g., shopping, harvesting, and gathering), preservation/storage, preparation, cooking, and consumption (e.g., portion size and nutrition analysis). Our wearable device (\"eButton\" worn on the chest) acquires real-life images automatically during wake hours at preset time intervals. The recorded images, in amounts of tens of thousands per day, are post-processed to obtain the information of interest. Although we expect future Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to extract the information automatically, at present we utilize AI to separate the acquired images into two binary classes: images with (Class 1) and without (Class 0) edible items. As a result, researchers need only to study Class-1 images, reducing their workload significantly. In this paper, we present a composite machine learning method to perform this classification, meeting the specific challenges of high complexity and diversity in the real-world LMIC data. Our method consists of a deep neural network (DNN) and a shallow learning network (SLN) connected by a novel probabilistic network interface layer. After presenting the details of our method, an image dataset acquired from Ghana is utilized to train and evaluate the machine learning system. Our comparative experiment indicates that the new composite method performs better than the conventional deep learning method assessed by integrated measures of sensitivity, specificity, and burden index, as indicated by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.",
    "answer": "Obesity is known to elevate the risk of other conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes through various mechanisms. One of the key ways in which obesity contributes to these conditions is by causing chronic inflammation and insulin resistance in the body. This can lead to atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease. Additionally, obesity is associated with dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, and an increased likelihood of developing metabolic syndrome, all of which are risk factors for heart disease.\n\nFurthermore, obesity is a significant risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. Excess body fat, especially around the abdomen, can lead to insulin resistance, where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. This can result in high blood sugar levels, eventually leading to the development of type 2 diabetes. Obesity also increases the production of inflammatory molecules and hormones that can interfere with the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels.\n\nOverall, obesity can directly and indirectly contribute to the development of heart disease and type 2 diabetes through complex interactions involving inflammation, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and other metabolic disturbances. It is essential to address obesity through lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and weight management, to reduce the risk of these serious health conditions.",

    "question": "What is the connection between genetic factors and the risk of specific cancers?",
    "context": "24324325<SEP>Simon Rosenfeld<SEP>Are the somatic mutation and tissue organization field theories of carcinogenesis incompatible?<SEP>Two drastically different approaches to understanding the forces driving carcinogenesis have crystallized through years of research. These are the somatic mutation theory (SMT) and the tissue organization field theory (TOFT). The essence of SMT is that cancer is derived from a single somatic cell that has successively accumulated multiple DNA mutations, and that those mutations occur on genes which control cell proliferation and cell cycle. Thus, according to SMT, neoplastic lesions are the results of DNA-level events. Conversely, according to TOFT, carcinogenesis is primarily a problem of tissue organization: carcinogenic agents destroy the normal tissue architecture thus disrupting cell-to-cell signaling and compromising genomic integrity. Hence, in TOFT the DNA mutations are the effect, and not the cause, of the tissue-level events. Cardinal importance of successful resolution of the TOFT versus SMT controversy dwells in the fact that, according to SMT, cancer is a unidirectional and mostly irreversible disease; whereas, according to TOFT, it is curable and reversible. In this paper, our goal is to outline a plausible scenario in which TOFT and SMT can be reconciled using the framework and concepts of the self-organized criticality (SOC), the principle proven to be extremely fruitful in a wide range of disciplines pertaining to natural phenomena, to biological communities, to large-scale social developments, to technological networks, and to many other subjects of research.33769147<SEP>Yuval Ramot<SEP>Microscope-Based Automated Quantification of Liver Fibrosis in Mice Using a Deep Learning Algorithm<SEP>In preclinical studies that involve animal models for hepatic fibrosis, accurate quantification of the fibrosis is of utmost importance. The use of digital image analysis based on deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can facilitate accurate evaluation of liver fibrosis in these models. In the present study, we compared the quantitative evaluation of collagen proportionate area in the carbon tetrachloride model of liver fibrosis in the mouse by a newly developed AI algorithm to the semiquantitative assessment of liver fibrosis performed by a board-certified toxicologic pathologist. We found an excellent correlation between the 2 methods of assessment, most evident in the higher magnification (\u00d740) as compared to the lower magnification (\u00d710). These findings strengthen the confidence of using digital tools in the toxicologic pathology field as an adjunct to an expert toxicologic pathologist.33916939<SEP>Diane F Halpern<SEP>Critical Thinking: A Model of Intelligence for Solving Real-World Problems<SEP>Most theories of intelligence do not directly address the question of whether people with high intelligence can successfully solve real world problems. A high IQ is correlated with many important outcomes (e.g., academic prominence, reduced crime), but it does not protect against cognitive biases, partisan thinking, reactance, or confirmation bias, among others. There are several newer theories that directly address the question about solving real-world problems. Prominent among them is Sternberg's adaptive intelligence with \"adaptation to the environment\" as the central premise, a construct that does not exist on standardized IQ tests. Similarly, some scholars argue that standardized tests of intelligence are not measures of rational thought-the sort of skill/ability that would be needed to address complex real-world problems. Other investigators advocate for critical thinking as a model of intelligence specifically designed for addressing real-world problems. Yes, intelligence (i.e., critical thinking) can be enhanced and used for solving a real-world problem such as COVID-19, which we use as an example of contemporary problems that need a new approach.34339288<SEP>J Harvey Turner<SEP>Responsible Radionuclide Cancer Care<SEP>The landscape of nuclear oncology is rapidly changing. The advent of molecular radionuclide theranostics, multidisciplinary tumor board decision making, artificial intelligence and radiomics interpretation of diagnostic imaging, evolution of pharmacogenomics prediction of tumor response, and regulatory requirements for prospective individual dosimetry are just some of the elements which are broadening the essence of physician responsibility. The burgeoning knowledge base essential for mastering the emergent technologies, and their profound effect on moral philosophic aspects of provision of cancer care, are challenging. The new relationship of the theranostic nuclear physician with respect to shared care of the individual patient, particularly with regard to transparency, accountability, and responsibility for targeted radionuclide diagnosis and therapy of cancer, will be explored in this update.",
