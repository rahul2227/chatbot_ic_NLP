    "context": "34783668<SEP>Meghan S Nagpal<SEP>Patient-Generated Data Analytics of Health Behaviors of People Living With Type 2 Diabetes: Scoping Review<SEP>Background: Complications due to type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be mitigated through proper self-management that can positively change health behaviors. Technological tools are available to help people living with, or at risk of developing, T2D to manage their condition, and such tools provide a large repository of patient-generated health data (PGHD). Analytics can provide insights into the health behaviors of people living with T2D. Objective: The aim of this review is to investigate what can be learned about the health behaviors of those living with, or at risk of developing, T2D through analytics from PGHD. Methods: A scoping review using the Arksey and O'Malley framework was conducted in which a comprehensive search of the literature was conducted by 2 reviewers. In all, 3 electronic databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library) were searched using keywords associated with diabetes, behaviors, and analytics. Several rounds of screening using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria were conducted, after which studies were selected. Critical examination took place through a descriptive-analytical narrative method, and data extracted from the studies were classified into thematic categories. These categories reflect the findings of this study as per our objective. Results: We identified 43 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this review. Although 70% (30/43) of the studies examined PGHD independently, 30% (13/43) combined PGHD with other data sources. Most of these studies used machine learning algorithms to perform their analysis. The themes identified through this review include predicting diabetes or obesity, deriving factors that contribute to diabetes or obesity, obtaining insights from social media or web-based forums, predicting glycemia, improving adherence and outcomes, analyzing sedentary behaviors, deriving behavior patterns, discovering clinical correlations from behaviors, and developing design principles. Conclusions: The increased volume and availability of PGHD have the potential to derive analytical insights into the health behaviors of people living with T2D. From the literature, we determined that analytics can predict outcomes and identify granular behavior patterns from PGHD. This review determined the broad range of insights that can be examined through PGHD, which constitutes a unique source of data for these applications that would not be possible through the use of other data sources.30269984<SEP>Sahar Ashrafzadeh<SEP>Patient-Driven Diabetes Care of the Future in the Technology Era<SEP>The growing burden of diabetes is fueled by obesity-inducing lifestyle behaviors including high-calorie diets and lack of physical activity.

    "context": "30227185<SEP>Sophie K Kieffer<SEP>Temporal Changes in a Novel Metric of Physical Activity Tracking (Personal Activity Intelligence) and Mortality: The HUNT Study, Norway<SEP>Background: Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a novel activity metric that translates heart rate variations during exercise into a weekly score. Weekly PAI scores assessed at a single point in time were found to associate with lower risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the general healthy population. However, to date, the associations between long-term longitudinal changes in weekly PAI scores and mortality have not been explored. Purpose: The aim of the present study was to prospectively examine the association between change in weekly PAI scores estimated 10 years apart, and risk of mortality from CVD and all-causes. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of 11,870 men and 13,010 women without known CVD in Norway. By using data from the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT), PAI was estimated twice, ten years apart (HUNT1 1984-86 and HUNT2 1995-97). Mortality was followed-up until December 31, 2015. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for death from CVD and all-causes related to temporal changes in PAI were estimated using Cox regression analyses. Results: During a mean (SD) of 18 (4) years of follow-up, there were 4782 deaths, including 1560 deaths caused by CVD. Multi-adjusted analyses demonstrated that participants achieving a score of \u2265100 PAI at both time points had 32% lower risk of CVD mortality (AHR 0.68; CI: 0.54-0.86) for CVD mortality and 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality (AHR 0.80; CI: 71-0.91) compared with participants obtaining <100 weekly PAI at both measurements. For participants having <100 PAI in HUNT1 but \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2, the AHRs were 0.87 (CI: 0.74-1.03) for CVD mortality, and 0.86 (CI: 0.79-0.95) for all-cause mortality. We also found an inverse linear relationship between change in PAI and risk of CVD mortality among participants with 0 PAI (P < 0.01), and \u226450 PAI (P = 0.04) in HUNT1, indicating that an increase in PAI over time is associated with lower risk of mortality. Excluding the first three years of follow-up did not substantially alter the findings. Increasing PAI score from <100 PAI in HUNT1 to \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2 was associated with 6.6 years gained lifespan. Conclusion: Among men and women without known CVD, an increase in PAI score and sustained high PAI score over a 10-year period was associated with lower risk of mortality.30193673<SEP>Sophie K Kieffer<SEP>Personal Activity Intelligence and Mortality in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease: The HUNT Study<SEP>Objective: To test whether Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI), a personalized metric of physical activity (PA) tracking, is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in patients with self-reported CVD and to determine whether these associations change depending on whether contemporary PA recommendations are met. Patients and methods: A total of 3133 patients with CVD (mean [SD] age, 67.6 [10.3] years; 64% men) were followed from the date of participation in the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (between January 1, 1984, and February 28, 1986) until the date of death or the end of follow-up (December 31, 2015). The participants' weekly PAI score was calculated and divided into 4 groups (PAI scores of 0, \u226450, 51-99, and \u2265100). We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios for CVD and all-cause mortality rates. Results: After mean follow-up of 12.5 years (39,157 person-years), there were 2936 deaths (94%), including 1936 CVD deaths. Participants with weekly PAI scores of 100 or greater had 36% (95% CI, 21%-48%) and 24% (95% CI, 10%-35%) lower risk of mortality from CVD and all causes, respectively, compared with the inactive group. Participants had similar risk reductions associated with their weekly PAI scores regardless of following contemporary PA recommendations or not. Conclusion: Obtaining a weekly PAI score of at least 100 was associated with lower mortality risk from CVD and all causes in individuals with CVD regardless of whether the current PA recommendations were met.28274818<SEP>Nina Zisko<SEP>Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI), Sedentary Behavior and Cardiovascular Risk Factor Clustering - the HUNT Study<SEP>Prolonged sedentary behavior (SB) positively associates with clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The recently developed metric for physical activity (PA) tracking called Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) takes into account age, sex, resting and maximum heart rate, and a score of \u2265100 weekly PAI has been shown to reduce the risk of premature CVD death in healthy as well as individuals with known CVD risk factors, regardless of whether or not the current PA recommendations were met. The aim of the present study was to examine if PAI modifies the associations between SB and CVD risk factor (CV-RF) clustering in a large apparently healthy general population cohort (n=29,950, aged \u226520 years). Logistic regression revealed that in those with \u2265100 weekly PAI, the likelihood of CV-RF clustering prevalence associated with prolonged SB was attenuated across age groups. Monitoring weekly PAI-level could be useful to ensure that people perform enough PA to combat SB's deleterious association with CV-RF.28721757<SEP>972<SEP>Higher childhood intelligence linked to longer life<SEP>Higher intelligence in childhood is associated with lower lifetime risk of major causes of death, including heart disease, stroke, smoking-related cancers, respiratory disease and dementia.",
    "answer": "# Does regular physical activity lower the likelihood of cardiovascular disease? \n\n**Relevant Contextual Information:**\n\n## Context 1:\n- **Study ID:** 30227185\n- **Authors:** Sophie K Kieffer et al.\n- **Title:** Temporal Changes in a Novel Metric of Physical Activity Tracking (Personal Activity Intelligence) and Mortality: The HUNT Study, Norway\n- **Key Findings:** Individuals without known CVD who maintained a high Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) score or improved their score over a 10-year period displayed a significantly reduced risk of mortality from both CVD and all causes.

In individuals with a PAI score of \u2265100, the likelihood of CV-RF clustering due to prolonged SB was less pronounced across different age groups.\n\n## Context 4:\n- **Study ID:** 28721757\n- **Authors:** Unspecified (Abstract Reference)\n- **Title:** Higher childhood intelligence linked to longer life\n- **Key Insights:** Intelligence in childhood is correlated with lower risks of major causes of death, including heart disease, throughout life.\n\n**Synthesized Answer:**\n\nBased on the context provided by recent research studies, including The HUNT Study led by Sophie K Kieffer and Nina Zisko, regular physical activity is associated with a decreased likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a metric for tracking physical activity levels, and individuals with a PAI score of 100 or above have been observed to have a significantly reduced risk of both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Such protective benefits were noted in both the general healthy population and those with pre-existing CVD.\n\nImprovements in PAI scores over time have shown to correlate with increased longevity and reduced risk of CVD death. Furthermore, maintaining an active lifestyle with regular physical activity can also mitigate the negative effects of sedentary behavior on cardiovascular risk factors. While not directly linked to the PAI metric, other research suggests that higher intelligence in childhood is also associated with a reduced risk of CVD mortality later in life, offering another perspective on factors that can contribute to cardiovascular health.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn sum, the evidence points strongly towards regular physical activity as a means to lower the likelihood of cardiovascular disease, with the novel PAI metric serving as a useful indicator of mortality risk from CVD and other causes. This underscores the importance of sustaining or increasing physical activity levels throughout life for cardiovascular health benefits.",

    "question": "Is asthma recognized as a respiratory ailment?",
    "context": "36127649<SEP>Hassan Joumaa<SEP>Artificial intelligence to differentiate asthma from COPD in medico-administrative databases<SEP>Introduction: Discriminating asthma from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using medico-administrative databases is challenging but necessary for medico-economic analyses focusing on respiratory diseases. Artificial intelligence (AI) may improve dedicated algorithms. Objectives: To assess performance of different AI-based approaches to distinguish asthmatics from COPD patients in medico-administrative databases where the clinical diagnosis is absent. An \"Asthma COPD Overlap\" category was defined to further test whether AI can detect complexity. Methods: This study included 178,962 patients treated by two \"R03\" treatment prescriptions at least from January 2016 to December 2018 and managed by either a general practitioner and/or a pulmonologist participating in a permanent longitudinal observatory of prescription in ambulatory medicine (LPD). Clinical diagnoses are available in this database and were used as gold standards to develop diagnostic rules. Three types of AI approaches were explored using data restricted to demographics and treatment dispensations: multinomial regression, gradient boosting and recurrent neural networks (RNN). The best performing model (based on metric properties) was then applied to estimate the size of asthma and COPD populations based on a database (LRx) of treatment dispensations between July, 2018 and June, 2019. Results: The best models were obtained with the boosting approach and RNN, with an overall accuracy of 68%. Performance metrics were better for asthma than COPD. Based on LRx data, the extrapolated numbers of patients treated for asthma and COPD in France were 3.7 and 1.2 million, respectively. Asthma patients were younger than COPD patients (mean, 49.9 vs. 72.1 years); COPD occurred mostly in men (68%) compared to asthma (33%). Conclusion: AI can provide models with acceptable accuracy to distinguish between asthma, ACO and COPD in medico-administrative databases where the clinical diagnosis is absent. Deep learning and machine learning (RNN) had similar performances in this regard.36776483<SEP>Eva Topole<SEP>Artificial intelligence based software facilitates spirometry quality control in asthma and COPD clinical trials<SEP>Rationale: Acquiring high-quality spirometry data in clinical trials is important, particularly when using forced expiratory volume in 1 s or forced vital capacity as primary end-points. In addition to quantitative criteria, the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) standards include subjective evaluation which introduces inter-rater variability and potential mistakes. We explored the value of artificial intelligence (AI)-based software (ArtiQ.QC) to assess spirometry quality and compared it to traditional over-reading control. Methods: A random sample of 2000 sessions (8258 curves) was selected from Chiesi COPD and asthma trials (n=1000 per disease). Acceptability using the 2005 ATS/ERS standards was determined by over-reader review and by ArtiQ.QC. Additionally, three respiratory physicians jointly reviewed a subset of curves (n=150). Results: The majority of curves (n=7267, 88%) were of good quality. The AI agreed with over-readers in 91% of cases, with 97% sensitivity and 93% positive predictive value. Performance was significantly better in the asthma group. In the revised subset, n=50 curves were repeated to assess intra-rater reliability (\u03ba=0.83, 0.86 and 0.80 for each of the three reviewers). All reviewers agreed on 63% of 100 unique tests (\u03ba=0.5). When reviewers set the consensus (gold standard), individual agreement with it was 88%, 94% and 70%. The agreement between AI and \"gold-standard\" was 73%; over-reader agreement was 46%. Conclusion: AI-based software can be used to measure spirometry data quality with comparable accuracy as experts. The assessment is a subjective exercise, with intra- and inter-rater variability even when the criteria are defined very precisely and objectively. By providing consistent results and immediate feedback to the sites, AI may benefit clinical trial conduct and variability reduction.34873098<SEP>Dylan Tran<SEP>Current state and future potential of AI in occupational respiratory medicine<SEP>Purpose of review: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the pace of technological development relating to pulmonary diseases. The advent of newer technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), continues to be adapted for diagnostic purposes. AI offers comparable precision to trained physicians under certain circumstances, as well as the unique ability to process the information characteristic of Big Data. With respect to individual susceptibilities/pre-existing diseases, AI seems poised to integrate such individualized information and contribute to a greater implementation of precision medicine. Recent findings: AI can match trained clinicians in specific applications, but AI has limitations that require clearly defined questions and a high quality of data. Data collected for this purpose is predicted to increase both in quality and volume, as technology concerned with personal health (FitBit, Apple Watch) proliferates. However, the role of AI with respect to physicians in a clinical setting is still being debated. AI generally aims to increase objectivity through its correlational methodology. Summary: AI continues to be a proliferative field of study. It has defined strengths and weaknesses which, if accounted for, has the potential to increase healthcare access as well as the quality of care delivered.34890934<SEP>Alberto De Ram\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez<SEP>Analyzing the use of artificial intelligence for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)<SEP>Objective: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease that causes airflow limitation to the lungs and has a high morbidity around the world. The objective of this study was to evaluate how artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied for the management of the disease, analyzing the objectives that are raised, the algorithms that are used and what results they offer. Methods: We conducted a scoping review following the Arksey and O'Malley (2005) and Levac et al. (2010) guidelines. Two reviewers independently searched, analyzed and extracted data from papers of five databases: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cinahl and Cochrane. To be included, the studies had to apply some AI techniques for the management of at least one stage of the COPD clinical process. In the event of any discrepancy between both reviewers, the criterion of a third reviewer prevailed. Results: 380 papers were identified through database searches. After applying the exclusion criteria, 67 papers were included in the study. The studies were of a different nature and pursued a wide range of objectives, highlighting mainly those focused on the identification, classification and prevention of the disease. Neural nets, support vector machines and decision trees were the AI algorithms most commonly used. The mean and median values of all the performance metrics evaluated were between 80% and 90%. Conclusions: The results obtained show a growing interest in the development of medical applications that manage the different phases of the COPD clinical process, especially predictive models. According to the performance shown, these models could be a useful complementary tool in the decision-making by health specialists, although more high-quality ML studies are needed to endorse the findings of this study.",

    "context": "36617923<SEP>Chinese Thoracic Society<SEP>[Chinese expert consensus on diagnosis of early lung cancer (2023 Edition)]<SEP>Lung cancer is the leading cause of the incidence and mortality of malignant tumors in our country, seriously endangering people's lives and health. The treatment of lung cancer has made great progress in the past 10 years, and the 5-year survival rate of lung cancer in China has also increased from 16.1% to 19.7%, but about 75% of patients are still in advanced stages of lung cancer at the time of diagnosis, missing the best time for radical surgery. Early diagnosis can significantly improve the prognosis and survival of lung cancer patients. From the 5-year survival rate of lung cancer patients, it can be seen that the 5-year survival rate of stage \u2160 patients was 77%-92%, while that of stage \u2162A-\u2163A patients was only 10%-36%, and there was a significant difference in the 5-year survival rate. Studies have shown that early-diagnosed and completely resected lung adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) have 5-year disease-specific survival rates of 100% and 100%, respectively. Early diagnosis is the key to improving the prognosis of lung cancer. In order to further improve the level of early lung cancer diagnosis in China, especially the standardization in the diagnosis and evaluation of pulmonary nodules and early lung cancer, experts from the Lung Cancer Group of Chinese Thoracic Society formulated the \"Chinese Expert Consensus on Diagnosis of Early Lung Cancer (2023 Edition)\", on the basis of the actual situation in the field of diagnosis and treatment, with reference to the latest research data and relevant guidelines at home and abroad. Consensus on the application of artificial intelligence, big data and robotics, the Internet of Things and multidisciplinary cooperation in the diagnosis of early lung cancer, the management of pulmonary nodules and follow-up strategies for suspected early lung cancer, etc., were respectively recommended to provide references for clinicians in the diagnosis of early lung cancer, in order to further promote the early diagnosis of lung cancer in China.33571312<SEP>Witness Mapanga<SEP>Consensus study on the health system and patient-related barriers for lung cancer management in South Africa<SEP>Background: Lung cancer is the highest incident cancer globally and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality particularly if identified at a late stage. Poor patient outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC's) might reflect contextual patient and health system constraints at multiple levels, that act as barriers to prevention, disease recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. Lung cancer screening, even for high-risk patients, is not available in the public health sector in South Africa (SA), where the current HIV and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics often take precedence. Yet, there has been no formal assessment of the individual and health-system related barriers that may delay patients with lung cancer from seeking and accessing help within the public health care system and receiving the appropriate and effective diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to derive consensus from health-system stakeholders in the urban Gauteng Province of SA on the most important challenges faced by the health services and patients in achieving optimum lung cancer management and to identify potential solutions. Methods: The study was undertaken among 27 participant stakeholders representing clinical managers, clinicians, opinion leaders from the public health sector and non-governmental organisation (NGO) representatives. The study compromised two components: consensus and engagement. For the consensus component, the Delphi Technique was employed with open-ended questions and item ranking from five rounds of consensus-seeking, to achieve collective agreement on the most important challenges faced by patients and the health services in achieving optimal lung cancer management. For the engagement component, the Nominal Group Technique was used to articulate ideas and reach an agreement on the group's recommendations for solution strategies and approaches. Results: Public health sector stakeholders suggested that a lack of knowledge and awareness of lung cancer, and the apparent stigma associated with the disease and its risk factors, as well as symptoms and signs, are critical to treatment delay. Furthermore, delays in up-referral of patients with suspected lung cancer from district health care level were attributed to inadequate knowledge arising from a lack of in-service training of nurses and doctors regarding oncologic symptoms, risk factors, need for further investigation, interpretation of x-rays and available treatments. At a tertiary level, participants suggested that insufficient availability of specialised diagnostic resources (imaging, cytological and pathological services including biomolecular assessment of lung cancer), theatres, cardiothoracic surgeons, and appropriate therapeutic modalities (chemotherapeutic agents and radiation oncology) are the main barriers to the provision of optimal care. It was suggested that a primary prevention programme initiated by the government that involves private-public partnerships may improve lung cancer management nationally. Conclusions: Considerable barriers to the early identification and treatment of lung cancer exist. Finding solutions to overcome both individual and health-system level obstacles to lung cancer screening and management are vital to facilitate early identification and treatment, and to improve survival. Furthermore, research on inexpensive biomarkers for asymptomatic disease detection, the introduction of diagnostic imaging tools that utilise artificial intelligence to compensate for inadequate human resources and improving clinical integration across all levels of the healthcare system are essential.29405289<SEP>Mohamad Rabbani<SEP>Role of artificial intelligence in the care of patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer<SEP>Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.

There has been a significant amount of research using machine learning to generate tools using patient data to improve outcomes. Methods: This narrative review is based on research material obtained from PubMed up to Nov 2017. The search terms include \"artificial intelligence,\" \"machine learning,\" \"lung cancer,\" \"Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC),\" \"diagnosis\" and \"treatment.\" Results: Recent studies support the use of computer-aided systems and the use of radiomic features to help diagnose lung cancer earlier. Other studies have looked at machine learning (ML) methods that offer prognostic tools to doctors and help them in choosing personalized treatment options for their patients based on molecular, genetics and histological features. Combining artificial intelligence approaches into health care may serve as a beneficial tool for patients with NSCLC, and this review outlines these benefits and current shortcomings throughout the continuum of care. Conclusion: We present a review of the various applications of ML methods in NSCLC as it relates to improving diagnosis, treatment and outcomes.36164695<SEP>H Huang<SEP>[Current situation and prospect of primary prevention of cancer in China]<SEP>Cancer is a major public health issue that seriously endangers the public health and social development of China. Future initiatives for cancer prevention and control should continue to adhere to the principle of prioritizing prevention, and comprehensively implement related prevention activities nationwide. This is critical to reducing cancer burden in Chinese residents, especially in the low- and middle-income populations and those living in areas that are less economically developed. In the past several decades, the international community has significantly reduced the incidence of related cancers through primary prevention measures such as tobacco control, improved occupational hygiene, and vaccination. China has also implemented a series of exploratory primary prevention measures among high-risk groups of cancer in specific areas including Xuanwei, Qidong, and Linxian, and achieved encouraging results. However, due to the low level of systematic awareness of cancer risk factors and the lack of awareness and ability of self-health management in Chinese residents, it is urgent to develop novel research tools and methods to further reveal the causes of cancer, and establish innovative mechanisms and systems of primary prevention of cancer at population and individual levels. Based on current status of the transformation of cancer spectrum and the development of digital intelligence, it would be beneficial to establish a smart digital system for primary cancer prevention service that can cover the entire population, integrating authoritative popular science education on primary prevention of cancer, individualized cancer risk assessment, and personalized health management assistant. This will improve primary cancer prevention among the Chinese general population and can help the sustainable development of cancer prevention and control in China.",
    "answer": "Considering the context provided, here are answers to the original question \"Does smoking elevate the risk of lung cancer?\" from multiple perspectives within the information offered:\n\n**1. Perspective of the Chinese Thoracic Society:**\nIn the consensus by the Chinese Thoracic Society on the diagnosis of early lung cancer, there's an emphasis on the importance of early diagnosis for improving prognosis. While smoking is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it's well recognized in medical literature that smoking is a significant risk factor for lung cancer. Thus, from the perspective of a medical society, it would be implied that reducing smoking rates would be beneficial for lowering the incidence of lung cancer, helping more patients get diagnosed at an earlier and more treatable stage.\n\n**2. Perspective of South African Health System Stakeholders:**\nThe South African study on lung cancer management barriers doesn't directly address smoking as a risk factor. However, the mention of primary prevention programmes and awareness implies a recognition of the need to address lifestyle and environmental factors contributing to lung cancer. Smoking is known to be one of these factors; hence, elevation of lung cancer risk due to smoking could be inferred as a concern that such primary prevention programmes would aim to target.\n\n**3. Perspective of Research on Artificial Intelligence in Lung Cancer Care:**\nThe narrative review on the role of artificial intelligence in the care of patients with non-small cell lung cancer highlights technological advancements in early diagnosis and personalized treatment. Smoking is a major risk factor for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and while AI is seen as a tool for improvement in outcomes, part of the broader approach to lung cancer care will include modifying risk factors, such as smoking cessation.\n\n**4. Perspective of Primary Prevention of Cancer in China:**\nThe remarks on the importance of primary prevention measures such as tobacco control among primary prevention initiatives imply that smoking is recognized as a modifiable risk factor. Therefore, within this context, we can presume that smoking is seen as a behavior that elevates the risk of lung cancer, and its control is crucial in reducing the cancer burden.\n\nIn summary, while the direct link between smoking and lung cancer risk is not explicitly stated in the provided contexts, the overall emphasis on early diagnosis, prevention, and the management of lung cancer strongly suggests that smoking is considered a significant risk factor for lung cancer across these diverse perspectives. Integrating smoking cessation into lung cancer management and prevention strategies is implied as a critical element in improving outcomes and reducing the incidence of the disease.",

    "question": "Is obesity linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes?",
    "context": "25959123<SEP>Calum D Moulton<SEP>Factors associated with cognitive impairment in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: a cross-sectional study<SEP>Objectives: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is strongly associated with cognitive impairment but the factors within T2DM that predispose to cognitive impairment are less well understood, while previous studies have investigated samples with T2DM of widely varying duration. We aimed to investigate the factors associated with cognitive impairment in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. Method: In a multi-ethnic sample with T2DM diagnosed in the last 6 months, we assessed cognitive function using the 13-item modified telephone interview for cognitive status (TICS-M). Cognitive function was assessed both categorically (impairment defined as lowest 10% of scores with the remainder as controls) and as continuous TICS-M score. Its associations were tested in univariate and multivariate analyses with a range of biological, psychological and sociodemographic factors. Results: Of 1790 participants, 1680 had a complete TICS-M assessment at baseline. After controlling for covariates, older age (p < 0.001) and lower verbal intelligence (p < 0.001) were associated with both cognitive impairment and lower TICS-M scores, while non-white ethnicity (p < 0.001), female gender (p = 0.02) and higher HbA1c (p = 0.002) were associated with lower TICS-M scores. Depression (defined as Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score \u226510), elevated inflammatory markers and body mass index were not associated with cognitive function after controlling for covariates. Conclusion: Age, verbal intelligence, female gender and HbA1c are associated with cognitive performance in T2DM soon after diagnosis. Previously reported associations with depression and inflammatory markers may occur later as causes or consequences of T2DM. Longitudinal analyses are needed to assess potentially modifiable factors predicting cognitive decline in early T2DM.27690485<SEP>Christopher M Ryan<SEP>Neurocognitive consequences of diabetes<SEP>Mild cognitive dysfunction is a well-established complication of diabetes and its management, although large numbers of psychologists and health professionals may be unaware of its existence, clinical implications, and etiology. Drawing on results from key studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, this article delineates the neurocognitive phenotypes characteristic of Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D), and identifies the most plausible risk factors, both those that may be modifiable, like degree of metabolic control, and those that cannot be changed, like the age when a child or adult is diagnosed. Most children and adults with T1D typically manifest lower scores on measures of intelligence and academic achievement, attention, psychomotor speed, and executive functions. These effects are especially pronounced in those who develop diabetes early in life, before the age of 6 or 7 years. Chronically elevated blood glucose values increase the risk of both cognitive dysfunction and microstructural changes in white matter tracts. Adults with T2D manifest cognitive dysfunction characterized by poorer performance on tasks requiring attention, psychomotor speed, planning and executive functions, and learning and memory. They are also at increased risk of developing dementia. Poorer metabolic control accelerates the rate of cognitive decline over time, and research suggests that improving metabolic control may slow the rate of decline. Psychologists and behavioral scientists can play a key role in preventing the onset of cognitive complications or in ameliorating their severity by implementing behavioral strategies known to increase adherence to medical regimens and improve metabolic control. (PsycINFO Database Record24077481<SEP>Marzieh Nazaribadie<SEP>Cognitive processes and functions in patients with type 2 diabetes in comparison to pre-diabetic patients<SEP>Background: Type 2 diabetes is an important risk factor for cognitive decline in diabetic patients. The main goal of this study was the assessment of memory, attention and visuospatial ability dysfunctions in patients with type 2 diabetes in comparison to pre-diabetic patients and normal subjects in Endocrine and Metabolism Center of Isfahan City from April 2011 to July 2011. Methods: The sample comprised of 32 patients with type 2 diabetes, 28 pre-diabetic patients and 30 healthy individuals. Memory, attention and visuospatial ability were assessed by Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) and sub tests of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-revised (WAIS-R). Results: The pair wise comparisons of cognitive functions among three groups, suggesting a significant difference between diabetic and normal groups in PASAT3\". PASAT2\", RCFT (recall trial) and Symbol coding (P=0.003, P=0.009, P=0.010, and P<0.001, respectively). But there was no difference in copy trial of RCFT and block design between two groups (P=0.170, P=0.490). There was significant difference between pre-diabetic group and normal group in recall trial of RCFT (P=0.020), as well as significant difference between diabetes type 2 and pre-diabetic group in symbol coding (P=0.001). Conclusions: There were significant differences in cognitive functions in patient with type2 diabetes, pre-diabetic patients and normal individuals. Thus monitoring neuropsychological status besides controlling levels of blood sugar in these patients is important.33197721<SEP>Victoria Whitelock<SEP>The mediating role of comorbid conditions in the association between type 2 diabetes and cognition: A cross-sectional observational study using the UK Biobank cohort<SEP>Aims: Using the UK Biobank cohort, a large sample of middle aged and older adults in the UK, the present study aimed to examine the cross-sectional association between type 2 diabetes and cognition and to assess the hypothesised mediating role of common comorbid conditions, whilst controlling for important demographic and lifestyle factors. Methods: Using regression models and general structural equation models, we examined the cross-sectional association between type 2 diabetes status and: fluid intelligence; reaction time; visual memory; digit span and prospective memory; and the hypothesised mediating role of common comorbid conditions: visceral obesity; sleep problems; macrovascular problems; respiratory problems; cancer and depressive symptoms in 47,468 participants from the UK Biobank cohort, of whom 1,831 have type 2 diabetes. We controlled for ethnicity, sex, age, deprivation, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity levels and use of diabetes medication. Results: Participants with type 2 diabetes had a significantly shorter digit span, b = -0.14, CIs [-0.27, -0.11] than those without type 2 diabetes. Those with type 2 diabetes did not differ from those without type 2 diabetes on fluid intelligence, reaction time, visual memory and prospective memory. The associations that do exist between type 2 diabetes and cognition are consistently mediated via macrovascular problems, depressive symptoms, and to a lesser extent visceral obesity. Respiratory problems, sleep disturbances and cancer did not mediate the association between type 2 diabetes status and measures of cognition. Conclusions: Comorbid conditions explain some of the observed association between type 2 diabetes and cognitive deficits. This suggests that prevention, management or treatment of these comorbid conditions may be important to reduce the likelihood of cognitive decline. Treatment studies with long follow-ups are needed to examine this.",
    "answer": "The question at hand is whether obesity is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. While the context provided does not directly answer this particular question, it provides information about cognitive impairment and type 2 diabetes, the consequences of diabetes on neurocognitive functions, the comparison of cognitive impairment between type 2 diabetes and prediabetic patients, and the mediating role of comorbid conditions in the association between type 2 diabetes and cognitive function.\n\nTo specifically respond to the question, extensive medical research has established that obesity is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes. Obesity, particularly visceral fat accumulation, increases insulin resistance, which is a major underlying mechanism of type 2 diabetes. This increased resistance means that the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin, making blood glucose levels rise, which can eventually lead to type 2 diabetes if it becomes chronic and unmanaged.\n\nSeveral points can be made considering the context provided and the association between type 2 diabetes and cognitive impairment:\n\n1. **Macrovascular Problems and Obesity**: The text mentions that macrovascular problems mediate the association between type 2 diabetes and cognitive deficits. Obesity is a known risk factor for vascular problems, including atherosclerosis, which can lead to cardiovascular diseases. Since type 2 diabetes is associated with similar vascular complications, it is reasonable to infer an indirect connection between obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cognitive impairment due to vascular problems.\n\n2. **Metabolic Control and Obesity**: Another study within the context discusses how metabolic control affects cognitive decline. Obesity can exacerbate poor metabolic control, leading to higher levels of metabolic dysregulation, including insulin resistance, which is intimately connected with the development and progression of type 2 diabetes.\n\n3. **Obesity as a Mediator**: While not explicitly stated, visceral obesity is mentioned as a mediating condition for cognitive deficits, which hints at the interconnected nature of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cognitive function. This supports the general understanding that obesity has wide-ranging impacts on health, including the exacerbation of type 2 diabetes, which in turn can affect cognitive function.\n\nIn summary, though the context provided is centered around the cognitive implications of type 2 diabetes, we can extrapolate that obesity, as a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes and associated macrovascular problems, has a recognized link to the development of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, given that obesity is mentioned as a mediating factor for cognitive deficits in the presence of type 2 diabetes, it reinforces the connection between obesity, diabetes, and wider health complications.",

    "context": "37892991<SEP>Vicentiu Mircea Saceleanu<SEP>Integrative Approaches in Acute Ischemic Stroke: From Symptom Recognition to Future Innovations<SEP>Among the high prevalence of cerebrovascular diseases nowadays, acute ischemic stroke stands out, representing a significant worldwide health issue with important socio-economic implications. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are important milestones for the management of this multifaceted pathology, making understanding the various stroke-onset symptoms crucial. A key role in acute ischemic stroke management is emphasizing the essential role of a multi-disciplinary team, therefore, increasing the efficiency of recognition and treatment. Neuroimaging and neuroradiology have evolved dramatically over the years, with multiple approaches that provide a higher understanding of the morphological aspects as well as timely recognition of cerebral artery occlusions for effective therapy planning. Regarding the treatment matter, the pharmacological approach, particularly fibrinolytic therapy, has its merits and challenges. Endovascular thrombectomy, a game-changer in stroke management, has witnessed significant advances, with technologies like stent retrievers and aspiration catheters playing pivotal roles. For select patients, combining pharmacological and endovascular strategies offers evidence-backed benefits. The aim of our comprehensive study on acute ischemic stroke is to efficiently compare the current therapies, recognize novel possibilities from the literature, and describe the state of the art in the interdisciplinary approach to acute ischemic stroke. As we aspire for holistic patient management, the emphasis is not just on medical intervention but also on physical therapy, mental health, and community engagement. The future holds promising innovations, with artificial intelligence poised to reshape stroke diagnostics and treatments. Bridging the gap between groundbreaking research and clinical practice remains a challenge, urging continuous collaboration and research.37668701<SEP>Stanislas Demuth<SEP>Strokecopilot: a literature-based clinical decision support system for acute ischemic stroke treatment<SEP>Background: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is an immediate emergency whose management is becoming more and more personalized while facing a limited number of neurologists with high expertise. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are digital tools leveraging information and artificial intelligence technologies. Here, we present the Strokecopilot project, a CDSS for the management of the acute phase of AIS. It has been designed to support the evidence-based medicine reasoning of neurologists regarding the indications of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular treatments (ET). Methods: Reference populations were manually extracted from the field's main guidelines and randomized clinical trials (RCT). Their characteristics were harmonized in a computerized reference database. We developed a web application whose algorithm identifies the reference populations matching the patient's characteristics. It returns the latter's outcomes in a graphical user interface (GUI), whose design has been driven by real-world practices. Results: Strokecopilot has been released at www.digitalneurology.net . The reference database includes 25 reference populations from 2 guidelines and 15 RCTs. After a request, the reference populations matching the patient characteristics are displayed with a summary and a meta-analysis of their results. The status regarding IVT and ET indications are presented as \"in guidelines\", \"in literature\", or \"outside literature references\". The GUI is updated to provide several levels of explanation. Strokecopilot may be updated as the literature evolves by loading a new version of the reference populations' database. Conclusion: Strokecopilot is a literature-based CDSS, developed to support neurologists in the management of the acute phase of AIS.30467491<SEP>Haris Kamal<SEP>Machine Learning in Acute Ischemic Stroke Neuroimaging<SEP>Machine Learning (ML) through pattern recognition algorithms is currently becoming an essential aid for the diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of complications and patient outcomes in a number of neurological diseases. The evaluation and treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) have experienced a significant advancement over the past few years, increasingly requiring the use of neuroimaging for decision-making. In this review, we offer an insight into the recent developments and applications of ML in neuroimaging focusing on acute ischemic stroke.37857099<SEP>Ines Ben Alaya<SEP>Automatic triaging of acute ischemic stroke patients for reperfusion therapies using Artificial Intelligence methods and multiple MRI features: A review<SEP>Background: The selection of appropriate treatments for Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS), including Intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and Mechanical thrombectomy, is a critical aspect of clinical decision-making. Timely treatment is essential, with recommended administration of therapies within 4.5 h of symptom onset. However, patients with unknown Time Since Stroke (TSS), are often excluded from thrombolysis, even if the stroke onset exceeds 6 h. Current clinical guidelines propose using multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to assess various mismatches. Methods: The review explores the significance of automatic methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms that utilize multiple MRI features to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from acute reperfusion therapies. These AI methods include TSS classification and patient selection for therapies in the late time window (>6 h) using MRI images to provide detailed stroke information. Results: The review discusses the challenges and limitations in the existing mismatch methods, which may lead to missed opportunities for reperfusion therapy. To address these limitations, AI approaches have been developed to enhance accuracy and support clinical decision-making. These AI methods have shown promising results, outperforming traditional mismatch assessments and providing improved sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients eligible for reperfusion therapies. Discussion: In summary, the integration of AI algorithms utilizing multiple MRI features has the potential to enhance accuracy, improve patient outcomes, and positively influence the decision-making process in AIS. However, ongoing research and collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and technologists are vital to realize the full potential of AI in optimizing stroke management.",
    "answer": "**Can hypertension result in a stroke?**\n\nHypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a well-documented risk factor for stroke, including acute ischemic stroke (AIS), as evidenced by various clinical studies and reviews. Here's a closer examination of the context provided from the vector database references:\n\n1. Saceleanu's integrative approach to AIS emphasizes the importance of understanding stroke-onset symptoms and the role of a multi-disciplinary team in managing the condition efficiently (37892991). While it doesn\u2019t directly mention hypertension, the management practices highlighted are particularly relevant for those at high risk, including individuals with hypertension.\n\n2. In Demuth's presentation of the Strokecopilot project, a clinical decision support system (CDSS) is developed to aid neurologists in AIS treatment decisions, including the use of IV thrombolysis and endovascular treatments (37668701). Although hypertension is not directly discussed, it is likely one of the many patient characteristics considered by the CDSS when determining treatment suitability.\n\n3. Kamal\u2019s overview of machine learning (ML) in AIS neuroimaging indicates a growing reliance on advanced technologies for diagnosis and treatment decisions (30467491). Hypertension could contribute to detected neuroimaging patterns that are indicative of stroke risk or active cerebrovascular events.\n\n4. The review by Ben Alaya discusses how artificial intelligence (AI) methods utilize MRI features to triage AIS patients for reperfusion therapies (37857099). Hypertension, which can predispose a person to strokes including AIS, might be an important factor in the AI algorithms that determine the most beneficial interventions for patients.\n\nUnderstanding the role of hypertension in stroke, it is clear that chronic high blood pressure can damage blood vessels, leading to narrowing, ruptures, or the formation of blood clots that can cause a stroke. In particular, hypertension is a significant risk factor for the development of AIS, as it can lead to conditions like arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis, which can eventually result in an ischemic event if a blood vessel is blocked.\n\nTherefore, in the context of AIS, effective management of hypertension is imperative to reduce the risk of stroke. The references provided support the adoption of rapid and innovative treatments and interventions that exist for managing AIS, which are critical for patients who may have experienced a stroke due to hypertension.\n\nInnovations in AI and neuroimaging are particularly promising for enhancing early diagnosis and treatment, which are critical for mitigating the effects of stroke and improving patient outcomes. However, it's essential for those at high risk of stroke, such as individuals with hypertension, to engage in preventive measures, medical interventions, and lifestyle modifications to lower their risk. Thus, continuous collaboration and research, as suggested in the last sentence of the last reference, remain pivotal in advancing our understanding and management of acute ischemic strokes, especially in the context of co-existing conditions like hypertension.",

Many cancer medicines have cardiotoxic effects but the size of the population exposed to these potentially cardiotoxic medicines is not known. We aimed to determine the prevalence of exposure to potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicines in Australia. Methods: We identified potentially cardiotoxic systemic cancer medicines through searching the literature and registered product information documents. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Australians dispensed potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicines between 2005 and 2021, calculating age-standardised annual prevalence rates of people alive with exposure to a potentially cardiotoxic medicine during or prior to each year of the study period. Findings: We identified 108,175 people dispensed at least one potentially cardiotoxic cancer medicine; median age, 64 (IQR: 52-74); 57% female. Overall prevalence increased from 49 (95%CI: 48.7-49.3)/10,000 to 232 (95%CI: 231.4-232.6)/10,000 over the study period; 61 (95%CI: 60.5-61.5)/10,000 to 293 (95%CI: 292.1-293.9)/10,000 for females; and 39 (95%CI: 38.6-39.4)/10,000 to 169 (95%CI: 168.3-169.7)/10,000 for males.

The UK military operates globally and in environments that are often austere. The very nature of these environments means that CBRNE3 incidents are a very real risk, and a CBRNE3 incident in a well-developed society could ultimately create an austere environment. Responding to such an event in an austere environment poses challenges.The very nature of the environment may be problematic. It may be very remote with limited or no access by road and/or air. It may have limited resources such as water and infrastructure required to manage the event. Extremes of temperature and weather may pose a risk to casualties and responders alike. Specialist teams and equipment may be required, but the host or partner nations may not have suitable capability and these resources may take time to mobilise from the home base. The volume of equipment and material needed in the response may overwhelm logistical chains which may not be robust enough to withstand the initial incident.Proper planning and preparedness is crucial to operating in and managing a CBRNE3 incident in an austere environment. Recognition of the potential threat by intelligence gathering and recognition by personnel on the ground are essential. This requires an appropriate awareness at all levels of command and appropriate prior training, including interoperability training with partner forces. Ultimately, robust planning and training is key to managing CBRNE3 incidents in an austere environment.24131614<SEP>Ramon Luengo-Fernandez<SEP>Economic burden of cancer across the European Union: a population-based cost analysis<SEP>Background: In 2008, 2\u00b745 million people were diagnosed with cancer and 1\u00b723 million died because of cancer in the 27 countries of the European Union (EU). We aimed to estimate the economic burden of cancer in the EU. Methods: In a population-based cost analysis, we evaluated the cost of all cancers and also those associated with breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers. We obtained country-specific aggregate data for morbidity, mortality, and health-care resource use from international and national sources. We estimated health-care costs from expenditure on care in the primary, outpatient, emergency, and inpatient settings, and also drugs. Additionally, we estimated the costs of unpaid care provided by relatives or friends of patients (ie, informal care), lost earnings after premature death, and costs associated with individuals who temporarily or permanently left employment because of illness. Findings: Cancer cost the EU \u20ac126 billion in 2009, with health care accounting for \u20ac51\u00b70 billion (40%). Across the EU, the health-care costs of cancer were equivalent to \u20ac102 per citizen, but varied substantially from \u20ac16 per person in Bulgaria to \u20ac184 per person in Luxembourg. Productivity losses because of early death cost \u20ac42\u00b76 billion and lost working days \u20ac9\u00b743 billion. Informal care cost \u20ac23\u00b72 billion. Lung cancer had the highest economic cost (\u20ac18\u00b78 billion, 15% of overall cancer costs), followed by breast cancer (\u20ac15\u00b70 billion, 12%), colorectal cancer (\u20ac13\u00b71 billion, 10%), and prostate cancer (\u20ac8\u00b743 billion, 7%).

    "answer": "**Answer Generation:**\n\nCancer prevention through diet and exercise is a complex subject that has been studied across various disciplines. In addressing the question \"Can certain cancer types be prevented through a nutritious diet and regular exercise?\", the literature offers insight that suggests a relationship between lifestyle choices, including nutrition and physical activity, and cancer risk.\n\nA nutritious diet and regular exercise are widely recognized for their role in maintaining overall health. These factors can help regulate body weight, improve immune system function, and reduce inflammation\u2014all of which may contribute to a decreased risk of certain types of cancer. Specifically, obesity is a known risk factor for several cancers, such as breast, colorectal, and endometrial cancer, and physical activity is thought to combat this risk through weight control and other mechanisms.\n\nGiven the context provided:\n\n**374365067 \u2013 Benjamin Daniels Study:**\nThe study focused on cardiotoxicity in cancer medicines highlights that individuals with cancer also face the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While this context does not directly address cancer prevention, it underscores the importance of overall health maintenance in cancer patients\u2014a population already at elevated risk for CVD. A nutritious diet and regular exercise are key components of cardiovascular health, which is relevant here since minimizing cardiotoxic risk and maintaining heart health can be essential for those undergoing cancer treatment with potentially cardiotoxic drugs.\n\n**24131614 \u2013 Ramon Luengo-Fernandez Study:**\nThis study estimated the economic burden of cancer across the EU and noted the significant costs associated with health care and lost productivity due to cancer. Prevention strategies, including diet and exercise, could potentially reduce the incidence of cancer and thereby also lessen the overall economic impact. Moreover, a healthy lifestyle can also lower expenses related to informal care and might lead to fewer lost working days due to illness.\n\n**35139920 \u2013 Sherry-Ann Brown Study:**\nThe Cardiology Oncology Innovation Network (COIN) initiative focuses on the intersection between cardiology and oncology, aiming to prevent cardiovascular diseases in cancer patients. While COIN's approach involves technological advancements and innovation, it parallels the importance of prevention\u2014in this case, for cardiovascular diseases. The principles of cancer and cardiovascular disease prevention through lifestyle modifications can be analogous, reinforcing the idea that a nutritious diet and regular exercise might be beneficial in more than one aspect of patient health.\n\nIn summary, while the context provided is largely related to cardiovascular health in the setting of cancer treatment, the economic burden of cancer, and a collaborative network for innovation in cardio-oncology, the principles of health maintenance via diet and exercise are universally applicable. These lifestyle modifications can play a role in the possible prevention of certain cancer types, while also mitigating some risks associated with treatment and managing overall health care costs. It is important, however, to acknowledge that cancer prevention is multifactorial and not all cancer types can be prevented through lifestyle choices alone. Genetic predispositions and environmental exposures, for instance, also significantly contribute to cancer risk. Nevertheless, adopting a healthy diet and engaging in regular physical activity are widely recommended as part of an overall approach to reduce one's risk of developing cancer.",

Randomized, controlled, blinded trials based on clinically representative samples are needed to evaluate not only adherence, but also to test for clinically meaningful and sustained clinical benefits in schizophrenia patients, who are especially difficult to treat.34994733<SEP>Jerzy Samochowiec<SEP>Polish Psychiatric Association consensus statement on non-pharmacological methods in the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia<SEP>This consensus statement has been prepared by a group of experts consisting of professionals with long experience in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, who were appointed by the Management Board of the Polish Psychiatric Association. The evaluation involved the analysis of literature databases and information derived from meta-analyses of these data for years 2010-2020. The searched publications were in English, German and Polish language versions and involved interventions performed in groups of adult patients. The efficacy of nonpharmacological methods applied for treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia were compared with effects of adifferent treatment/combined treatment/a group with no intervention. When formulating the recommendations, the experts analysed the source data in terms of their application in the Polish conditions. The current recommendations of academic societies and literature on the treatment of schizophrenia with predominant negative symptoms were taken into account. The experts included items that involved a comparison of a study group in terms of non-pharmacological interventions, and pharmacologically treated cases were taken into account only when divisions were made into standard treatment and additional intervention. The results were divided into 7 sections: 1. Psychoeducation, 2. Psychotherapy (individual, group and family therapy), 3. Psychiatric rehabilitation, 4. Emotional intelligence, social skills and mindfulness training, 5. Cognitive remediation/rehabilitation, cognitive training, 6. Clinical efficacy of physical activity, behavioral activation and metacognitive training, 7. Other rehabilitation methods (including biological methods). The recommendations were debated by experts, approved by the Management Board of the Polish Psychiatric Association,and -upon consideration of the submitted comments - adopted as aconsensus statement of the Association with the recommendation of their application in the treatment of schizophrenic patients in Poland.28223265<SEP>Earle E Bain<SEP>Use of a Novel Artificial Intelligence Platform on Mobile Devices to Assess Dosing Compliance in a Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Subjects With Schizophrenia<SEP>Background: Accurately monitoring and collecting drug adherence data can allow for better understanding and interpretation of the outcomes of clinical trials. Most clinical trials use a combination of pill counts and self-reported data to measure drug adherence, despite the drawbacks of relying on these types of indirect measures. It is assumed that doses are taken, but the exact timing of these events is often incomplete and imprecise. Objective: The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the use of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) platform (AiCure) on mobile devices for measuring medication adherence, compared with modified directly observed therapy (mDOT) in a substudy of a Phase 2 trial of the \u03b17 nicotinic receptor agonist (ABT-126) in subjects with schizophrenia. Methods: AI platform generated adherence measures were compared with adherence inferred from drug concentration measurements. Results: The mean cumulative pharmacokinetic adherence over 24 weeks was 89.7% (standard deviation [SD] 24.92) for subjects receiving ABT-126 who were monitored using the AI platform, compared with 71.9% (SD 39.81) for subjects receiving ABT-126 who were monitored by mDOT. The difference was 17.9% (95% CI -2 to 37.7; P=.08). Conclusions: Using drug levels, this substudy demonstrates the potential of AI platforms to increase adherence, rapidly detect nonadherence, and predict future nonadherence. Subjects monitored using the AI platform demonstrated a percentage change in adherence of 25% over the mDOT group. Subjects were able to use the technology successfully for up to 6 months in an ambulatory setting with early termination rates that are comparable to subjects outside of the substudy.

Cognitive remediation has proven effective in alleviating these deficits, with medium effect sizes. However, sizeable attrition rates are reported, with the reasons still uncertain. Furthermore, cognitive remediation is not part of routine mental health care. We conducted a systematic review to investigate factors that influence access and engagement of cognitive remediation in schizophrenia. Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases for peer-reviewed articles including a cognitive remediation arm, access, and engagement data, and participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders aged 17-65 years old. Duplicates and studies without a distinct cognitive remediation component, protocol papers, single case studies, case series, and reviews/meta-analyses were excluded. Results: We included 67 studies that reported data on access and engagement, and extracted quantitative and qualitative data. Access data were limited, with most interventions delivered on-site, to outpatients, and in middle- to high-income countries. We found a median dropout rate of 14.29%. Only a small number of studies explored differences between dropouts and completers (n = 5), and engagement factors (n = 13). Dropouts had higher negative symptomatology and baseline self-efficacy, and lower baseline neurocognitive functioning and intrinsic motivation compared to completers. The engagement was positively associated with intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, educational level, premorbid intelligence quotient, baseline neurocognitive functioning, some neurocognitive outcomes, and therapeutic alliance; and negatively associated with subjective cognitive complaints. Qualitative results showed good acceptability of cognitive remediation, with some areas for improvement. Conclusions: Overall, access and engagement results are scarce and heterogeneous. Further investigations of cognitive remediation for inpatients, as well as remote delivery, are needed. Future clinical trials should systematically explore attrition and related factors. Determining influential factors of access and engagement will help improve the implementation and efficacy of cognitive remediation, and thus the recovery of people with schizophrenia.",
    "answer": "While reviewing the provided context and considering multiple perspectives on the original question \"Can medication effectively treat mental health disorders?\", the answer would be nuanced and multifaceted.\n\n**Perspective 1: Medication Adherence in Pharmacological Treatment**\n\nThe review by Martina Curto (33543659) highlights that, in the case of schizophrenia, medication adherence is a significant challenge, affecting over half of the patients at some point. Poor adherence can lead to several adverse outcomes, such as clinical worsening and increased healthcare utilization. However, interventions such as long-acting injected (LAI) drug formulations and behavioral techniques are being explored to improve adherence. \n\n**Expert Opinion**: Medications can effectively treat mental health disorders such as schizophrenia when adherence is optimized. Interventions that promote adherence are critical to realizing the full potential of pharmacological treatments.\n\n**Perspective 2: Non-pharmacological Methods and Negative Symptoms**\n\nThe Polish Psychiatric Association consensus statement (34994733) by Jerzy Samochowiec provides an analysis of non-pharmacological methods in treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The statement explores a range of interventions and their efficacy compared to pharmacological treatment or combined approaches.\n\n**Expert Opinion**: Mental health disorders such as schizophrenia may require a combination of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for effective management, particularly for negative symptoms.\n\n**Perspective 3: Novel Technologies in Adherence Monitoring**\n\nEarle E Bain (28223265) discusses the use of an AI platform to assess dosing compliance. The platform appears to improve medication adherence through accurate monitoring, suggesting that technology can support patients in following their medication regimen more effectively.\n\n**Expert Opinion**: Novel AI technologies show promise in enhancing medication adherence, which is instrumental in the effective treatment of mental health disorders. Adherence data can fine-tune understanding of clinical trial outcomes and inform clinical practice.\n\n**Perspective 4: Access and Engagement in Cognitive Remediation**\n\nFinally, Rosalie Ariane Eva Altman (36448242) covers cognitive remediation therapy for schizophrenia, addressing its efficacy and the factors impacting patient access and commitment to the therapy. Despite the potential of cognitive remediation, it is not yet a routine part of mental health care, and there are barriers to access and engagement that need to be addressed.\n\n**Expert Opinion**: Neurocognitive deficits, a feature of many mental health disorders, can be effectively treated with cognitive remediation. The success of such non-pharmacological treatments depends on understanding and overcoming the barriers to access and engagement.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**: Medication can effectively treat mental health disorders like schizophrenia, especially when adherence is improved through various interventions and supported by technology. However, the treatment of negative symptoms and neurocognitive deficits often requires additional non-pharmacological methods to be fully effective. A combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments is likely necessary to address the diverse and complex needs of individuals with mental health disorders. Therefore, effective treatment depends on multiple factors, including medication adherence, the combination of treatment modalities, and patient access to and engagement with the therapies.",

    "question": "Is antibiotic usage necessary for viral infections?",
    "context": "34223026<SEP>Lesley Cooper<SEP>Supporting global antimicrobial stewardship: antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of surgical site infection in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs): a scoping review and meta-analysis<SEP>Background: The Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group is supporting two hospitals in Ghana to develop antimicrobial stewardship. Early intelligence gathering suggested that surgical prophylaxis was suboptimal. We reviewed the evidence for use of surgical prophylaxis to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to inform this work. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL and Google Scholar were searched from inception to 17 February 2020 for trials, audits, guidelines and systematic reviews in English. Grey literature, websites and reference lists of included studies were searched. Randomized clinical trials reporting incidence of SSI following Caesarean section were included in two meta-analyses. Narrative analysis of studies that explored behaviours and attitudes was conducted. Results: This review included 51 studies related to SSI and timing of antibiotic prophylaxis in LMICs. Incidence of SSI is higher in LMICs, infection surveillance data are poor and there is a lack of local guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis. Education to improve appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with reduction of SSI in LMICs. The random-effects pooled mean risk ratio of SSI in Caesarean section was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.51-1.17) for pre-incision versus post-incision prophylaxis and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.55-1.14) for short versus long duration. Reduction in cost and nurse time was reported in shorter-duration surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. Conclusions: There is scope for improvement, but interventions must include local context and address strongly held beliefs. Establishment of local multidisciplinary teams will promote ownership and sustainability of change.38259418<SEP>Dimple Kubde<SEP>Importance of Hospital Infection Control<SEP>The increasing demand for healthcare-acquired infection (HAI) control practices and services has intensified the need to evaluate care quality. The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced an infection prevention and control (IPC) framework to mitigate the impact of HAIs, crucial for ensuring patient safety in hospitals. HAIs acquired after hospitalization pose significant challenges due to factors such as compromised immunity, invasive medical procedures, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens, which have dire consequences, including higher mortality rates and increased healthcare costs. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are critical in implementing IPC measures. Infection control programs that include strategies such as hand hygiene, personal protective equipment (PPE), environmental cleaning, and surveillance have become standard. However, challenges such as resistance to change, resource limitations, patient turnover, and variability in patient conditions persist. Strategies to maintain hospital infection control involve rigorous compliance monitoring, staff education, advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), telemedicine, and innovative sanitation methods. The future of hospital infection control may involve increased integration of environmental monitoring, antimicrobial stewardship, and patient participation while leveraging collaboration among healthcare facilities. The review highlights the criticality of hospital infection control and suggests trends and opportunities to strengthen prevention efforts and patient safety.37660712<SEP>Alex Howard<SEP>Antimicrobial treatment imprecision: an outcome-based model to close the data-to-action loop<SEP>Health-care systems, food supply chains, and society in general are threatened by the inexorable rise of antimicrobial resistance. This threat is driven by many factors, one of which is inappropriate antimicrobial treatment. The ability of policy makers and leaders in health care, public health, regulatory agencies, and research and development to deliver frameworks for appropriate, sustainable antimicrobial treatment is hampered by a scarcity of tangible outcome-based measures of the damage it causes. In this Personal View, a mathematically grounded, outcome-based measure of antimicrobial treatment appropriateness, called imprecision, is proposed. We outline a framework for policy makers and health-care leaders to use this metric to deliver more effective antimicrobial stewardship interventions to future patient pathways. This will be achieved using learning antimicrobial systems built on public and practitioner engagement; solid implementation science; advances in artificial intelligence; and changes to regulation, research, and development. The outcomes of this framework would be more ecologically and organisationally sustainable patterns of antimicrobial development, regulation, and prescribing. We discuss practical, ethical, and regulatory considerations involved in the delivery of novel antimicrobial drug development, and policy and patient pathways built on artificial intelligence-augmented measures of antimicrobial treatment imprecision.32246143<SEP>Timothy M Rawson<SEP>A Real-world Evaluation of a Case-based Reasoning Algorithm to Support Antimicrobial Prescribing Decisions in Acute Care<SEP>Background: A locally developed case-based reasoning (CBR) algorithm, designed to augment antimicrobial prescribing in secondary care was evaluated. Methods: Prescribing recommendations made by a CBR algorithm were compared to decisions made by physicians in clinical practice. Comparisons were examined in 2 patient populations: first, in patients with confirmed Escherichia coli blood stream infections (\"E. coli patients\"), and second in ward-based patients presenting with a range of potential infections (\"ward patients\"). Prescribing recommendations were compared against the Antimicrobial Spectrum Index (ASI) and the World Health Organization Essential Medicine List Access, Watch, Reserve (AWaRe) classification system. Appropriateness of a prescription was defined as the spectrum of the prescription covering the known or most-likely organism antimicrobial sensitivity profile. Results: In total, 224 patients (145 E. coli patients and 79 ward patients) were included. Mean (standard deviation) age was 66 (18) years with 108/224 (48%) female sex. The CBR recommendations were appropriate in 202/224 (90%) compared to 186/224 (83%) in practice (odds ratio [OR]: 1.24 95% confidence interval [CI]: .392-3.936; P = .71). CBR recommendations had a smaller ASI compared to practice with a median (range) of 6 (0-13) compared to 8 (0-12) (P < .01). CBR recommendations were more likely to be classified as Access class antimicrobials compared to physicians' prescriptions at 110/224 (49%) vs. 79/224 (35%) (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.212-2.588; P < .01). Results were similar for E. coli and ward patients on subgroup analysis. Conclusions: A CBR-driven decision support system provided appropriate recommendations within a narrower spectrum compared to current clinical practice. Future work must investigate the impact of this intervention on prescribing behaviors more broadly and patient outcomes.",
    "answer": "The primary question posed is whether antibiotic usage is necessary for viral infections. To address this, we need to examine the context provided by the vector database which references various studies and research on antimicrobial stewardship, hospital infection control, and antibiotic usage:\n\n1. Lesley Cooper's study concerns **antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of surgical site infections (SSIs)** in LMICs, highlighting the importance of appropriate antibiotic use to reduce SSIs and the need for local guidelines and education to improve antimicrobial stewardship.\n\n2. Dimple Kubde's work on hospital infection control stresses **the importance of preventing healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs)** with a focus on the role of healthcare workers and the implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC) measures.\n\n3. Alex Howard discusses **antimicrobial treatment imprecision** and proposes an outcome-based measure to guide more effective antimicrobial stewardship interventions, involving public engagement, AI, and changes in regulation.\n\n4. Timothy M Rawson evaluates a case-based reasoning algorithm designed to **support antimicrobial prescribing decisions** showing that algorithm-based recommendations were more likely to be appropriate and narrower in spectrum compared to physicians' prescriptions.\n\nFrom the information given, none of the studies explicitly address the necessity of antibiotics for viral infections. However, looking through a broader lens that includes lessons from antimicrobial stewardship and understanding from the context, it is generally accepted that **antibiotics are not effective against viral infections** because antibiotics target bacterial mechanisms that viruses do not possess.\n\nAntibiotic prophylaxis, such as that discussed in Cooper's study, is to prevent bacterial infections associated with surgery, not viral infections. The need for appropriate antibiotic usage and the problems of antimicrobial resistance mentioned in Howard's and Rawson's studies emphasize the importance of not using antibiotics for the wrong reasons, such as treating viral infections, to avoid exacerbating resistance issues.\n\nIn conclusion, the consensus supported by the context and widely accepted in medical practice is that antibiotic usage is not necessary for viral infections and is in fact inappropriate. Doing so contributes to the global problem of antibiotic resistance. Effective antimicrobial stewardship and IPC measures are crucial in controlling the spread of infections, whether they are bacterial or viral in nature, without resorting to unnecessary antibiotic use.",

    "question": "Do vaccines aid in preventing specific infectious diseases?",
    "context": "37919737<SEP>Ritu Chauhan<SEP>The impact of geo-political socio-economic factors on vaccine dissemination trends: a case-study on COVID-19 vaccination strategies<SEP>Background: The world in recent years has seen a pandemic of global scale. To counter the widespread loss of life and severe repercussions, researchers developed vaccinations at a fast pace to immunize the population. While the vaccines were developed and tested through extensive human trials, historically vaccines have been known to evoke mixed sentiments among the generic demographics. In the proposed study, we aim to reveal the impact of political and socio-economic factors on SARS-Cov-2 vaccination trends observed in two hundred and seventeen countries spread across the six continents. Methods: The study had hypothesized that the citizens who have lower trust in their government would be less inclined towards vaccination programs. To test this hypothesis, vaccination trends of nations under authoritarian rule were compared against democratic nations. Further, the study was synthesized with Cov-2 vaccination data which was sourced from Our World Data repository, which was sampled among 217 countries spread across the 6 continents. The study was analyzed with exploratory data analysis and proposed with relevance and impacting factor that was considered for vaccine dissemination in comparison with the literacy rate of the nations. Another impacting factor the study focused on for the vaccination dissemination trends was the health expenses of different nations. The study has been synthesized on political and socio-economic factors where the features were ardently study in retrospect of varied socio- economic features which may include country wise literacy rate, overall GDP rate, further we substantiated the work to address the political factors which are discussed as the country status of democratic or having other status. Results: The comparison of trends showed that dissemination of SARS-Cov-2 vaccines had been comparable between the two-opposing types of governance. The major impact factor behind the wide acceptance of the SARS-Cov-2 vaccine was the expenditure done by a country on healthcare. These nations used a large number of vaccines to administer to their population and the trends showed positive growth. The overall percentage of vaccine utilized by countries in quantitative terms are Pfizer/BioNTech (17.55%), Sputnik V (7.08%), Sinovac (6.98%), Sinopharm/Beijing (10.04%), Oxford/AstraZeneca (19.56%), CanSino (2.85%), Moderna (12.05%), Covaxin (3.28%), JohnsonandJohnson (10.89%), Sputnik Light (3.07%), Novavax (3.49%). While the nations with the lowest healthcare expenses failed to keep up with the demand and depended on vaccines donated by other countries to protect their population. Conclusions: The analysis revealed strong indicators that the nations which spend more on healthcare were the ones that had the best SARS-Cov-2 vaccination rollout. To further support decision-making in the future, countries should address the trust and sentiment of their citizens towards vaccination. For this, expenses need to be made to develop and promote vaccines and project them as positive health tools.37876712<SEP>Yongqiang Zhang<SEP>On the momentum toward vaccine self-sufficiency in the BRICS: an integrative review of the role of pharmaceutical entrepreneurship and innovation<SEP>Background: With the perspicuous effect of COVID-19 on vaccine demand, academic and business interest in vaccine production in the BRICS nations (Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China, and South Africa) has reached a crescendo. Aware of a \"dark\" past when the BRICS depended heavily on vaccines and pharmaceuticals from other parts of the world, academic curiosity on how the BRICS countries have leveraged vaccine self-sufficiency and become the hub of global vaccine production and supply is justifiable, especially in times of ineffable pandemics. Methods: The articles were searched from November 2020 to December 2022. Within this period, an electronic search of 13 reputable healthcare and public databases was conducted. The initial searches from the designated databases yielded a total of 3,928 articles. Then, duplicated studies were removed through a two-step process, articles without titles and abstracts were excluded, and the remaining 898 articles that met the qualification assessment criteria were evaluated for article quality. Results: The main entrepreneurial innovations that have quickened the pace of vaccine self-sufficiency in the BRICS include investment in artificial intelligence (AI), Big Data Analytics, and Blockchain technologies. These help to speed up the drug delivery process by enhancing patient identification or optimizing potential drug candidates for clinical trials and production. Conclusion: Over the past 20 years, the BRICS nations have achieved major strides in vaccine development, regulation, and production. The creation of the BRICS Vaccine Research and Development (R&D) Center will have a significant impact on vaccine cost and accessibility given the anticipated development of stronger research capability, production, and distribution technology, as well as stronger standardization to improve vaccine production quality in the near future. It is anticipated that the BRICS' contributions to vaccine development will alter the global vaccination market and hasten the availability of vaccinations in developing nations. The challenge is turning these hopes into concrete plans of action and outcomes.33644412<SEP>P Alison Paprica<SEP>Essential requirements for establishing and operating data trusts: practical guidance co-developed by representatives from fifteen canadian organizations and initiatives<SEP>Introduction: Increasingly, the label \"data trust\" is being applied to repeatable mechanisms or approaches to sharing data in a timely, fair, safe, and equitable way. However, there is an absence of practical guidance regarding how to establish and operate a data trust. Aim and approach: In December 2019, the Canadian Institute for Health Information and the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence convened a working meeting of 19 people representing 15 Canadian organizations/initiatives involved in data sharing, most of which focus on public sector health data. The objective was to identify essential requirements for the establishment and operation of data trusts in the Canadian context. Preliminary requirements were discussed during the meeting and then refined as authors contributed to this manuscript. Results: Twelve minimum specification requirements (\"min specs\") for data trusts were identified. The foundational min spec is that data trusts must meet all legal requirements, including legal authority to collect, hold or share data. In addition, there was agreement that data trusts must have (i) an accountable governing body to ensure that the data trust achieves its stated purpose and is transparent, (ii) comprehensive data management including clear processes and qualified individuals responsible for the collection, storage, access, disclosure and use of data, (iii) training and accountability requirements for all data users and (iv) ongoing public and stakeholder engagement. Conclusions: Practical guidance for the establishment and operation of data trusts was articulated in the form of 12 min specs requirements. The 12 min specs are a starting point. Future work to refine and strengthen them with members of the public, companies, and additional research data stakeholders from within and outside of Canada, is recommended.36404170<SEP>Keran Moll<SEP>Background rates of adverse events of special interest for COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring in the United States, 2019-2020<SEP>Background: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Biologics Effectiveness and Safety (BEST) Initiative conducts active surveillance of adverse events of special interest (AESI) after COVID-19 vaccination. Historical incidence rates (IRs) of AESI are comparators to evaluate safety. Methods: We estimated IRs of 17 AESI in six administrative claims databases from January 1, 2019, to December 11, 2020: Medicare claims for adults \u2265 65 years and commercial claims (Blue Health Intelligence\u00ae, CVS Health, HealthCore Integrated Research Database, IBM\u00ae MarketScan\u00ae Commercial Database, Optum pre-adjudicated claims) for adults < 65 years. IRs were estimated by sex, age, race/ethnicity (Medicare), and nursing home residency (Medicare) in 2019 and for specific periods in 2020. Results: The study included >100 million enrollees annually. In 2019, rates of most AESI increased with age. However, compared with commercially insured adults, Medicare enrollees had lower IRs of anaphylaxis (11 vs 12-19 per 100,000 person-years), appendicitis (80 vs 117-155), and narcolepsy (38 vs 41-53). Rates were higher in males than females for most AESI across databases and varied by race/ethnicity and nursing home status (Medicare). Acute myocardial infarction (Medicare) and anaphylaxis (all databases) IRs varied by season. IRs of most AESI were lower during March-May 2020 compared with March-May 2019 but returned to pre-pandemic levels after May 2020. However, rates of Bell's palsy, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, narcolepsy, and hemorrhagic/non-hemorrhagic stroke remained lower in multiple databases after May 2020, whereas some AESI (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation) exhibited higher rates after May 2020 compared with 2019. Conclusion: AESI background rates varied by database and demographics and fluctuated in March-December 2020, but most returned to pre-pandemic levels after May 2020. It is critical to standardize demographics and consider seasonal and other trends when comparing historical rates with post-vaccination AESI rates in the same database to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine safety.",
    "answer": "### Do vaccines aid in preventing specific infectious diseases?\n\n**Vaccines are designed to prevent specific infectious diseases** by stimulating the body's immune system to produce an immune response similar to that of a natural infection, but without causing disease. They often contain weakened or inactivated toxins, parts of the virus or bacteria that are causing the disease, or mRNA that instructs our cells to produce protein antigens.\n\nIn the broader context of the provided excerpts, we can relate several perspectives on how vaccines contribute to public health, especially in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\n1. **Impact of Socio-political and Economic Factors (from Ritu Chauhan's study):** While vaccines can prevent diseases, the successful dissemination and uptake of these vaccines are affected by socio-political and economic factors. Higher healthcare expenditure by a country correlates with better vaccination rollout, indicating the financial support in healthcare infrastructure is vital for effective vaccine dissemination. Furthermore, trust in the government also influences people's willingness to get vaccinated, which is a crucial step in preventing infectious diseases. \n\n2. **Vaccine Self-Sufficiency and Innovation (Yongqiang Zhang's review):** The experience during the COVID-19 pandemic showed the importance of vaccine self-sufficiency. Countries that are able to produce their own vaccines can respond more rapidly and efficiently to infectious disease outbreaks. The growth in vaccine research and development in BRICS countries indicates a momentum towards not just production but also innovation, which is critical for vaccine accessibility and thus, disease prevention. Pharmaceutical entrepreneurship and investments in technologies like AI and Big Data Analytics are enhancing vaccine production capabilities.\n\n3. **Data Trusts and Vaccine Safety Monitoring (P Alison Paprica's guidance):** Establishing data trusts can play a role in vaccine safety monitoring by providing a framework for fair and equitable sharing of data. Such an organization of data sharing can contribute to ongoing surveillance of adverse events, ensuring that vaccines continue to be safe and effective in preventing diseases in a transparent manner that fosters public trust.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Evaluating Vaccine Safety (Keran Moll's background rates):** The continuous monitoring of adverse events from vaccines is crucial. Understanding and comparing the rates of adverse events of special interest (AESI) before and after vaccine introduction helps establish the safety profile of the vaccines. This is vital in reassuring the public that vaccines are safe and effective, which in turn, promotes vaccine uptake and disease prevention. \n\nIn conclusion, **vaccines are a critical tool in preventing specific infectious diseases**, and their efficacy is enhanced by trust in their safety and the socio-political and economic context in which they are disseminated. The studies and reviews referenced provide a multi-faceted understanding of the roles vaccines play, the challenges they face, and their impact on public health. The collective information from these contexts underscores the importance of vaccine dissemination, innovations in vaccine production, and robust data sharing approaches to foster a solid public health response to infectious diseases.",

    "context": "37918637<SEP>Rozalina G McCoy<SEP>Longitudinal trajectories of glycemic control among U.S. Adults with newly diagnosed diabetes<SEP>Aims: To identify longitudinal trajectories of glycemic control among adults with newly diagnosed diabetes, overall and by diabetes type. Methods: We analyzed claims data from OptumLabs\u00ae Data Warehouse for 119,952 adults newly diagnosed diabetes between 2005 and 2018. We applied a novel Mixed Effects Machine Learning model to identify longitudinal trajectories of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) over 3 years of follow-up and used multinomial regression to characterize factors associated with each trajectory. Results: The study population was comprised of 119,952 adults with newly diagnosed diabetes, including 696 (0.58%) with type 1 diabetes. Among patients with type 1 diabetes, 52.6% were diagnosed at very high HbA1c, partially improved, but never achieved control; 32.5% were diagnosed at low HbA1c and deteriorated over time; and 14.9% had stable low HbA1c. Among patients with type 2 diabetes, 67.7% had stable low HbA1c, 14.4% were diagnosed at very high HbA1c, partially improved, but never achieved control; 10.0% were diagnosed at moderately high HbA1c and deteriorated over time; and 4.9% were diagnosed at moderately high HbA1c and improved over time. Conclusions: Claims data identified distinct longitudinal trajectories of HbA1c after diabetes diagnosis, which can be used to anticipate challenges and individualize care plans to improve glycemic control.26173465<SEP>K Semenkovich<SEP>Academic abilities and glycaemic control in children and young people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus<SEP>Aims: To determine if children and young people aged < 23 years with Type 1 diabetes differ in academic ability from age-matched control subjects without Type 1 diabetes and whether academic scores are related to glycaemic control. Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design, we administered cognitive and academic tests (Woodcock-Johnson III Spatial Relations, General Information, Letter-Word Recognition, Calculation and Spelling tests) to young people with Type 1 diabetes (n=61) and control subjects (n=26) aged 9-22 years. The groups did not differ in age or gender. Participants with Type 1 diabetes had a disease duration of 5-17.7 years. History of glycaemic control (HbA1c , diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycaemic episodes) was obtained via medical records and interviews. Results: The participants with Type 1 diabetes had a lower mean estimated verbal intelligence (IQ) level compared with those in the control group (P=0.04). Greater exposure to hyperglycaemia over time was associated with lower spelling abilities within the group with Type 1 diabetes (P=0.048), even after controlling for age, gender, socio-economic status, blood glucose level at time of testing and verbal IQ (P=0.01). History of severe hypoglycaemia or ketoacidosis was not associated with differences in academic abilities. Conclusions: In children and young people, Type 1 diabetes was associated with a lower verbal IQ. Moreover, increased exposure to hyperglycaemia was associated with lower spelling performance. These results imply that hyperglycaemia can affect cognitive function and/or learning processes that may affect academic achievement.36862942<SEP>Brigitte I Frohnert<SEP>Refining the Definition of Stage 1 Type 1 Diabetes: An Ontology-Driven Analysis of the Heterogeneity of Multiple Islet Autoimmunity<SEP>Objective: To estimate the risk of progression to stage 3 type 1 diabetes based on varying definitions of multiple islet autoantibody positivity (mIA).

Results: Of 865 (5%) children with mIA, 537 (62%) progressed to type 1 diabetes. The 15-year cumulative incidence of diabetes varied from the most stringent definition (mIA/Persistent/2: two or more islet autoantibodies positive at the same visit with two or more antibodies persistent at next visit; 88% [95% CI 85-92%]) to the least stringent (mIA/Any: positivity for two islet autoantibodies without co-occurring positivity or persistence; 18% [5-40%]). Progression in mIA/Persistent/2 was significantly higher than all other groups (P < 0.0001). Intermediate stringency definitions showed intermediate risk and were significantly different than mIA/Any (P < 0.05); however, differences waned over the 2-year follow-up among those who did not subsequently reach higher stringency. Among mIA/Persistent/2 individuals with three autoantibodies, loss of one autoantibody by the 2-year follow-up was associated with accelerated progression. Age was significantly associated with time from seroconversion to mIA/Persistent/2 status and mIA to stage 3 type 1 diabetes. Conclusions: The 15-year risk of progression to type 1 diabetes risk varies markedly from 18 to 88% based on the stringency of mIA definition. While initial categorization identifies highest-risk individuals, short-term follow-up over 2 years may help stratify evolving risk, especially for those with less stringent definitions of mIA.31822304<SEP>Yana Suchy<SEP>Executive Cognitive Functions and Behavioral Control Differentially Predict HbA1c in Type 1 Diabetes across Emerging Adulthood<SEP>Objectives: To examine the contributions of two aspects of executive functioning (executive cognitive functions and behavioral control) to changes in diabetes management across emerging adulthood. Methods: Two hundred and forty-seven high school seniors with type 1 diabetes were assessed at baseline and followed up for 3 years. The baseline assessment battery included performance-based measures of executive cognitive functions, behavioral control, IQ estimate (IQ-est), and psychomotor speed; self-report of adherence to diabetes regimen; and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) assay kits as a reflection of glycemic control. Results: Linear and quadratic growth curve models were used to simultaneously examine baseline performance on four cognitive variables (executive cognitive functions, behavioral control, IQ, and psychomotor speed) as predictors of indices of diabetes management (HbA1c and adherence) across four time points. Additionally, general linear regressions examined relative contributions of each cognitive variable at individual time points. The results showed that higher behavioral control at baseline was related to lower (better) HbA1c levels across all four time points. In contrast, executive cognitive functions at baseline were related to HbA1c trajectories, accounting for increasingly more HbA1c variance over time with increasing transition to independence. IQ-est was not related to HbA1c levels or changes over time, but accounted instead for HbA1c variance at baseline (while teens were still living at home), above and beyond all other variables. Cognition was unrelated to adherence. Conclusions: Different aspects of cognition play a different role in diabetes management at different time points during emerging adulthood years.",
    "answer": "Based on the context provided, early indicators of diabetes can be centered around the concept of glycemic control and its biomarker, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The provided studies highlight different aspects of diabetes management and progression, particularly in relation to type 1 diabetes, and provide a deeper understanding of how early indicators might present themselves.\n\n**Early Indicators of Diabetes from the Context of the Studies:**\n\n1. **HbA1c Levels:**\n   - The longitudinal study by Rozalina G McCoy suggests that newly diagnosed diabetes patients can be grouped based on their HbA1c trajectories post-diagnosis. *Early indicators* here are related to the initial HbA1c values observed at diagnosis and the subsequent changes over time. \n   - High initial HbA1c levels, particularly those that partially improved but never achieved control, indicate a difficult glycemic management journey ahead. On the other hand, people with low HbA1c that deteriorates over time could indicate underdiagnosed or developing diabetes.\n\n2. **Cognitive and Behavioral Changes (in Type 1 Diabetes specifically):**\n   - K Semenkovich's study points out that children and young people with Type 1 diabetes demonstrated a lower estimated verbal IQ and that hyperglycaemic exposure adversely affected academic performance. This implies that cognitive changes, such as difficulty in learning or memory, could potentially be early indicators of diabetes, specifically type 1 diabetes, particularly if linked with other factors of poor glycemic control.\n   - Yana Suchy's research also links executive cognitive functions and behavioral control to HbA1c levels, suggesting that these cognitive aspects might also serve as early indicators, with changes in these areas potentially signaling issues in diabetes management.\n\n3. **Presence of Multiple Islet Autoantibodies (for Type 1 Diabetes):**\n   - Brigitte I Frohnert's study focuses on the heterogeneity of multiple islet autoantibody positivity (mIA) in type 1 diabetes. The presence of multiple autoantibodies can be an early biomarker for the risk of progression to full-blown type 1 diabetes. Therefore, early detection of these autoantibodies could serve as an indicator for preventative monitoring and intervention.\n\n**General Early Indicators of Diabetes Not Directly Mentioned in Context:**\n\n- **Thirst and Frequent Urination:** Excessive thirst and increased urination are common early signs of diabetes, as the body tries to rid itself of unused glucose through urine.\n- **Increased Hunger:** Despite eating more than usual, a person with diabetes may experience hunger due to the inability of their cells to access glucose for energy effectively.\n- **Unexplained Weight Loss:** Especially in the context of type 1 diabetes, weight loss may occur despite increased appetite, due to the loss of glucose through urine and the breakdown of muscle tissue for energy.\n- **Fatigue:** General feeling of tiredness and weakness can be linked to insufficient glucose utilization.\n- **Blurry Vision:** High blood sugar levels can lead to temporary changes in the shape of the lens of the eye, resulting in vision changes.\n\nIn conclusion, early indicators of diabetes involve a mix of clinical signs, such as changes in HbA1c levels, as well as functional changes, including cognitive and behavioral implications. Detection of multiple islet autoantibodies can also serve as an early warning sign, especially for type 1 diabetes. Understanding these varied perspectives, guided by real-world data as in the context provided, can help in early identification and management of diabetes.",

    "question": "Which exercises are most advantageous for cardiac health?",
    "context": "36737711<SEP>Mohamad Jihad Mansour<SEP>Clinical significance of the hemodynamic gain index in patients undergoing exercise stress testing and coronary computed tomography angiography<SEP>Background: Many hemodynamic parameters provide limited information regarding obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) during exercise stress testing particularly when exercise is suboptimal. Hemodynamic gain index (HGI) is a recent sensitive indicator of ischemia and has been associated with increased mortality. This study evaluated the clinical impact of HGI in patients who underwent concomitant exercise stress testing and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Methods: A total of 284 consecutive patients from the executive health program between 2010 and 2018 were identified. Resting and peak heart rate (HR) as well as systolic blood pressure (SBP) measurements were recorded. Framingham risk score (FRS), Duke treadmill score (DTS) and HGI [Formula: see text] were calculated. The latter was divided into quartiles. CCTA was used as a reference test to detect any CAD. Multivariate analysis and artificial neural network were used to determine the independent predictors of obstructive CAD. Results: Mean age was 53 \u00b1 12 years with 83% male. Mean HGI was 1.74 \u00b1 0.67, with cut-off value of severely blunted HGI \u2264 1.25 (Quartile 4). Patients with severely blunted HGI were older, had higher FRS, and worse DTS. Patients with obstructive CAD had lower HGI when compared to those with normal CCTA/non-obstructive CAD (1.36 \u00b1 0.53 vs. 1.77 \u00b1 0.67, P = 0.005), and showed a higher prevalence of severely blunted HGI (44% vs. 22%, P = 0.019). After adjusting for traditional risk factors, HGI remained an independent predictor of obstructive CAD while severely blunted HGI was associated with threefold increased odds of having obstructive CAD (P = 0.05). Using artificial intelligence analysis, severely blunted HGI independently predicted obstructive CAD with an area under the curve of 0.83 and 0.96, and normalized importance of HGI of 100% and 63%, respectively for different models. Conclusions: Among patients who underwent concomitant exercise stress testing and CCTA, severely blunted HGI independently predicted obstructive CAD after multivariate adjustment for traditional risk factors.35620767<SEP>Florian F Schmitzberger<SEP>Detection of Hemodynamic Status Using an Analytic Based on an Electrocardiogram Lead Waveform<SEP>Objectives: Delayed identification of hemodynamic deterioration remains a persistent issue for in-hospital patient care. Clinicians continue to rely on vital signs associated with tachycardia and hypotension to identify hemodynamically unstable patients. A novel, noninvasive technology, the Analytic for Hemodynamic Instability (AHI), uses only the continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) signal from a typical hospital multiparameter telemetry monitor to monitor hemodynamics. The intent of this study was to determine if AHI is able to predict hemodynamic instability without the need for continuous direct measurement of blood pressure. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Single quaternary care academic health system in Michigan. Patients: Hospitalized adult patients between November 2019 and February 2020 undergoing continuous ECG and intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring in an intensive care setting. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: One million two hundred fifty-two thousand seven hundred forty-two 5-minute windows of the analytic output were analyzed from 597 consecutive adult patients. AHI outputs were compared with vital sign indications of hemodynamic instability (heart rate > 100 beats/min, systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg, and shock index of > 1) in the same window. The observed sensitivity and specificity of AHI were 96.9% and 79.0%, respectively, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 for heart rate and systolic blood pressure. For the shock index analysis, AHI's sensitivity was 72.0% and specificity was 80.3% with an AUC of 0.81. Conclusions: The AHI-derived hemodynamic status appropriately detected the various gold standard indications of hemodynamic instability (hypotension, tachycardia and hypotension, and shock index > 1). AHI may provide continuous dynamic hemodynamic monitoring capabilities in patients who traditionally have intermittent static vital sign measurements.36713103<SEP>Ali Ahmad<SEP>Machine learning aids clinical decision-making in patients presenting with angina and non-obstructive coronary artery disease<SEP>Aims: The current gold standard comprehensive assessment of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is through a limited-access invasive catheterization lab procedure. We aimed to develop a point-of-care tool to assist clinical guidance in patients presenting with chest pain and/or an abnormal cardiac functional stress test and with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD). Methods and results: This study included 1893 NOCAD patients (<50% angiographic stenosis) who underwent CMD evaluation as well as an electrocardiogram (ECG) up to 1-year prior. Endothelial-independent CMD was defined by coronary flow reserve (CFR) \u22642.5 in response to intracoronary adenosine. Endothelial-dependent CMD was defined by a maximal percent increase in coronary blood flow (%\u0394CBF) \u226450% in response to intracoronary acetylcholine infusion. We trained algorithms to distinguish between the following outcomes: CFR \u22642.5, %\u0394CBF \u226450, and the combination of both. Two classes of algorithms were trained, one depending on ECG waveforms as input, and another using tabular clinical data. Mean age was 51 \u00b1 12 years and 66% were females (n = 1257). Area under the curve values ranged from 0.49 to 0.67 for all the outcomes. The best performance in our analysis was for the outcome CFR \u22642.5 with clinical variables. Area under the curve and accuracy were 0.67% and 60%. When decreasing the threshold of positivity, sensitivity and negative predictive value increased to 92% and 90%, respectively, while specificity and positive predictive value decreased to 25% and 29%, respectively. Conclusion: An artificial intelligence-enabled algorithm may be able to assist clinical guidance by ruling out CMD in patients presenting with chest pain and/or an abnormal functional stress test. This algorithm needs to be prospectively validated in different cohorts.34629086<SEP>Amanda L Hannan<SEP>Effect of personal activity intelligence (PAI) monitoring in the maintenance phase of cardiac rehabilitation: a mixed methods evaluation<SEP>Background: Personal activity intelligence (PAI) is a single physical activity metric based upon heart rate responses to physical activity. Maintaining 100 PAI/week is associated with a 25% risk reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality and 50 PAI/week provides 60% of the benefits. The effect of utilising this metric within a cardiac population has not been previously investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of PAI monitoring on the amount and/or intensity of physical activity for people in the maintenance phase of cardiac rehabilitation and to explore participants' perceptions of this approach. Methods: A concurrent mixed methods approach was undertaken. Participants in the maintenance phase of cardiac rehabilitation monitored PAI for six weeks via a wearable physical activity monitoring device (WPAM). In the first three weeks participants were blinded to their PAI score. A quality-of-life questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) was completed, and semi-structured interviews conducted to investigate attitudes to PAI monitoring. Daily PAI data was collected throughout the 6-week period. Results: Twenty participants completed the trial. PAI earned/day was increased after participants could view their data (mean difference: 2.1 PAI/day (95% CI 0.3, 4.0), p = 0.027). The median change in percentage of days participants achieved a Total PAI score of 25 (p = 0.023) and 50 (p = 0.015) were also increased. The mean change in total scores for the EQ-5D-5L and EQVAS were improved after 6 weeks (0.6 \u00b1 1.05; 95% CI (0.11-1.09); p = 0.019); (5.8/100; 95% CI (2.4-9.2); p = 0.002 respectively). Thematic framework analysis identified three global themes (perceptions on the WPAM, PAI and factors affecting exercise). Most participants stated motivation to exercise increased after they could view their PAI data. Many of the participants believed they would continue to use PAI long-term. Others were undecided; the latter primarily due to technical issues and/or preferring devices with greater functionality and attractiveness. All participants would recommend PAI. Conclusion: This exploratory study showed monitoring PAI via a WPAM increased the amount and/or intensity of physical activity within the cardiac population. Participants found PAI interesting, beneficial, and motivating. If technical issues, aesthetics, and functionality of the WPAM were improved, participants may continue to use the approach long-term. PAI may be a viable strategy to assist people with cardiac disease maintain physical activity adherence.",
    "answer": "Considering the context provided by the vector database, the following insights can offer a comprehensive understanding of exercises advantageous for cardiac health:\n\n1. **Exercise Stress Testing**: From the study by Mohamad Jihad Mansour, we understand that exercise stress testing, possibly in conjunction with coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), can identify hemodynamic parameters and their significance in obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). This suggests that engaging in exercises that could be used in stress testing (treadmill walking or running, stationary cycling) may not only serve as beneficial activities for cardiac health but also provide measurable indicators (like the Hemodynamic gain index, or HGI) to gauge cardiac function.\n\n2. **Continuous Heart Rate Monitoring**: The use of Analytic for Hemodynamic Instability (AHI) mentioned in Florian F Schmitzberger's study suggests the importance of consistent heart rate monitoring during exercise for individuals at risk of cardiac health issues. Exercises conducive to cardiac health should allow for heart rate monitoring to ensure safety and optimize therapeutic impact.\n\n3. **Non-Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease and ECG Analysis**: The use of machine learning for clinical decision-making in patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD), as per Ali Ahmad's research, underscores the role of carefully chosen exercises that do not exacerbate underlying conditions. This context hints at the value of exercises that maintain stable ECG readings and consistent coronary flow, possibly favoring moderate-intensity activities.\n\n4. **Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI)**: Amanda L Hannan's study spotlights the concept of PAI, which is based on heart rate responses to physical activity. The data demonstrates that maintaining a certain PAI score can lead to significant reductions in cardiovascular disease mortality. Exercises that effectively raise your heart rate within your targeted zone and help maintain your PAI score would be most beneficial. This could include, but not limited to, brisk walking, cycling, swimming, or jogging, tailored to the individual's capacity and monitored appropriately.\n\nFrom these perspectives, it's apparent that the most advantageous exercises for cardiac health are those that:\n- Can be scaled to the individual's fitness level and cardiac health status.\n- Allow for heart rate monitoring to ensure exercise intensity is within a safe and effective range.\n- Are sustainable and can be consistently performed over time for cumulative benefits (reflected in studies about PAI and hemodynamic indicators).\n\nIt is recommended to consult with healthcare professionals before beginning any new exercise program, especially for individuals with existing cardiac conditions or significant risk factors for CAD. Ensuring safety and personalizing exercise regimens based on factors such as age, gender, current health status, and medical history is crucial for optimizing cardiac health benefits.",

    "context": "37902681<SEP>Ahmad Z Al Meslamani<SEP>How AI is advancing asthma management? Insights into economic and clinical aspects<SEP>Asthma, an increasingly prevalent chronic respiratory condition, incurs significant economic costs worldwide. Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Machine Learning (ML), has been widely recognized as transformative when applied to asthma care. This commentary investigates how AI and ML may improve clinical outcomes while alleviating some of the costs associated with asthma care. AI's powerful analytical abilities could usher in an unprecedented era of preventive measures, particularly by identifying at-risk populations and anticipating environmental triggers. ML shows promise for enhancing real-time monitoring, early detection, and tailored treatment strategies in paediatric asthma, potentially reducing hospitalizations and emergency care costs. Emerging AI-powered wearable technologies are catalysing a revolutionary shift in patient monitoring, providing proactive interventions. Although optimistic, this commentary highlights a gap in empirical studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of AI in asthma care and stresses the need for larger datasets to accurately represent the economic benefits of AI solutions. Additionally, this paper emphasizes the ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and algorithmic bias, which are vital for the successful and equitable integration of AI into healthcare settings. This editorial underscores the urgent necessity of conducting thorough analyses to assess all economic implications, facilitate optimized resource allocation, and foster a nuanced understanding of AI/ML technologies in asthma management that may reduce costs to healthcare systems.36776483<SEP>Eva Topole<SEP>Artificial intelligence based software facilitates spirometry quality control in asthma and COPD clinical trials<SEP>Rationale: Acquiring high-quality spirometry data in clinical trials is important, particularly when using forced expiratory volume in 1 s or forced vital capacity as primary end-points. In addition to quantitative criteria, the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) standards include subjective evaluation which introduces inter-rater variability and potential mistakes. We explored the value of artificial intelligence (AI)-based software (ArtiQ.QC) to assess spirometry quality and compared it to traditional over-reading control. Methods: A random sample of 2000 sessions (8258 curves) was selected from Chiesi COPD and asthma trials (n=1000 per disease). Acceptability using the 2005 ATS/ERS standards was determined by over-reader review and by ArtiQ.QC. Additionally, three respiratory physicians jointly reviewed a subset of curves (n=150). Results: The majority of curves (n=7267, 88%) were of good quality. The AI agreed with over-readers in 91% of cases, with 97% sensitivity and 93% positive predictive value. Performance was significantly better in the asthma group. In the revised subset, n=50 curves were repeated to assess intra-rater reliability (\u03ba=0.83, 0.86 and 0.80 for each of the three reviewers). All reviewers agreed on 63% of 100 unique tests (\u03ba=0.5). When reviewers set the consensus (gold standard), individual agreement with it was 88%, 94% and 70%. The agreement between AI and \"gold-standard\" was 73%; over-reader agreement was 46%. Conclusion: AI-based software can be used to measure spirometry data quality with comparable accuracy as experts. The assessment is a subjective exercise, with intra- and inter-rater variability even when the criteria are defined very precisely and objectively. By providing consistent results and immediate feedback to the sites, AI may benefit clinical trial conduct and variability reduction.34339438<SEP>Hee Yun Seol<SEP>Artificial intelligence-assisted clinical decision support for childhood asthma management: A randomized clinical trial<SEP>Rationale: Clinical decision support (CDS) tools leveraging electronic health records (EHRs) have been an approach for addressing challenges in asthma care but remain under-studied through clinical trials. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of Asthma-Guidance and Prediction System (A-GPS), an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted CDS tool, in optimizing asthma management through a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Methods: This was a single-center pragmatic RCT with a stratified randomization design conducted for one year in the primary care pediatric practice of the Mayo Clinic, MN. Children (<18 years) diagnosed with asthma receiving care at the study site were enrolled along with their 42 primary care providers. Study subjects were stratified into three strata (based on asthma severity, asthma care status, and asthma diagnosis) and were blinded to the assigned groups. Measurements: Intervention was a quarterly A-GPS report to clinicians including relevant clinical information for asthma management from EHRs and machine learning-based prediction for risk of asthma exacerbation (AE). Primary endpoint was the occurrence of AE within 1 year and secondary outcomes included time required for clinicians to review EHRs for asthma management. Main results: Out of 555 participants invited to the study, 184 consented for the study and were randomized (90 in intervention and 94 in control group). Median age of 184 participants was 8.5 years. While the proportion of children with AE in both groups decreased from the baseline (P = 0.042), there was no difference in AE frequency between the two groups (12% for the intervention group vs. 15% for the control group, Odds Ratio: 0.82; 95%CI 0.374-1.96; P = 0.626) during the study period. For the secondary end points, A-GPS intervention, however, significantly reduced time for reviewing EHRs for asthma management of each participant (median: 3.5 min, IQR: 2-5), compared to usual care without A-GPS (median: 11.3 min, IQR: 6.3-15); p<0.001). Mean health care costs with 95%CI of children during the trial (compared to before the trial) in the intervention group were lower than those in the control group (-$1,036 [-$2177, $44] for the intervention group vs. +$80 [-$841, $1000] for the control group), though there was no significant difference (p = 0.12). Among those who experienced the first AE during the study period (n = 25), those in the intervention group had timelier follow up by the clinical care team compared to those in the control group but no significant difference was found (HR = 1.93; 95% CI: 0.82-1.45, P = 0.10). There was no difference in the proportion of duration when patients had well-controlled asthma during the study period between the intervention and the control groups. Conclusions: While A-GPS-based intervention showed similar reduction in AE events to usual care, it might reduce clinicians' burden for EHRs review resulting in efficient asthma management. A larger RCT is needed for further studying the findings. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02865967.36422090<SEP>Sreenidhi Prakash<SEP>Ethical Conundrums in the Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare-A Scoping Review of Reviews<SEP>Background: With the availability of extensive health data, artificial intelligence has an inordinate capability to expedite medical explorations and revamp healthcare.Artificial intelligence is set to reform the practice of medicine soon. Despite the mammoth advantages of artificial intelligence in the medical field, there exists inconsistency in the ethical and legal framework for the application of AI in healthcare. Although research has been conducted by various medical disciplines investigating the ethical implications of artificial intelligence in the healthcare setting, the literature lacks a holistic approach. Objective: The purpose of this review is to ascertain the ethical concerns of AI applications in healthcare, to identify the knowledge gaps and provide recommendations for an ethical and legal framework. Methodology: Electronic databases Pub Med and Google Scholar were extensively searched based on the search strategy pertaining to the purpose of this review. Further screening of the included articles was done on the grounds of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: The search yielded a total of 1238 articles, out of which 16 articles were identified to be eligible for this review. The selection was strictly based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria mentioned in the manuscript. Conclusion: Artificial intelligence (AI) is an exceedingly puissant technology, with the prospect of advancing medical practice in the years to come. Nevertheless, AI brings with it a colossally abundant number of ethical and legal problems associated with its application in healthcare. There are manifold stakeholders in the legal and ethical issues revolving around AI and medicine. Thus, a multifaceted approach involving policymakers, developers, healthcare providers and patients is crucial to arrive at a feasible solution for mitigating the legal and ethical problems pertaining to AI in healthcare.",
    "answer": "Based on the provided context from various studies and commentaries, seeking medical assistance for asthma should be considered in the following situations:\n\n1. **Deteriorating Symptoms:** If an individual's asthma symptoms become more frequent or severe, or if they notice a significant decline in lung function as reflected in measurements like peak flow, it would be advisable to seek medical intervention.\n\n2. **Poorly Controlled Asthma:** When one's asthma appears poorly controlled, with frequent need for quick-relief inhalers or disruption of daily activities, medical guidance can help adjust treatment plans for better control.\n\n3. **Exacerbations or Attacks:** Seeking urgent medical help is critical during an asthma attack that doesn't improve with the use of short-acting bronchodilators. This is a potentially life-threatening situation.\n\n4. **Before a Clinical Trial:** For individuals interested in participating in asthma or COPD clinical trials, consulting with a health professional is important to ensure their suitability and understand the implications of the study.\n\n5. **Clinical Decision Support Utilization:** When using advanced tools like the Asthma-Guidance and Prediction System (A-GPS) or other AI-assisted clinical decision support systems for asthma management, it is important to do so under professional medical guidance to ensure that the information and recommendations are properly interpreted and applied.\n\n6. **Routine Management and Review:** Regular medical reviews can ensure that asthma management plans are current and responsive to the patient's needs. The use of AI in asthma management, such as the application for quality control in spirometry, underscores the value of professional oversight to maintain high standards of care.\n\n7. **Ethical and Efficient Utilization of AI:** When considering the use of AI-based tools or interventions in asthma care, one should seek medical input to ensure that ethical considerations, data privacy, and the variables of algorithmic decision-making are adequately addressed.\n\nIt's crucial to approach asthma management as a collaborative process involving healthcare providers who can offer personalized advice relevant to an individual's specific condition and needs. AI and ML may offer support in this process, but the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional remains indispensable, especially for interpreting AI-driven data and integrating it into effective care plans.",

    "context": "34164283<SEP>Annemiek Snoeckx<SEP>The radiologist's role in lung cancer screening<SEP>Lung cancer is still the deadliest cancer in men and women worldwide. This high mortality is related to diagnosis in advanced stages, when curative treatment is no longer an option. Large randomized controlled trials have shown that lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (CT) can detect lung cancers at earlier stages and reduce lung cancer-specific mortality. The recent publication of the significant reduction of cancer-related mortality by 26% in the Dutch-Belgian NELSON LCS trial has increased the likelihood that implementation of LCS in Europe will move forward. Radiologists are important stakeholders in numerous aspects of the LCS pathway. Their role goes beyond nodule detection and nodule management. Being part of a multidisciplinary team, radiologists are key players in numerous aspects of implementation of a high quality LCS program. In this non-systematic review we discuss the multifaceted role of radiologists in LCS.35253286<SEP>Harriet L Lancaster<SEP>Low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening: Clinical evidence and implementation research<SEP>Lung cancer causes more deaths than breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer combined.

Given the organisational challenges for the healthcare systems of the countries concerned, this involves setting up pilot screening projects. This requires close collaboration between the players involved, with a multidisciplinary approach structured around the participant, aiming to offer the expertise of the pulmonologist and the radiologist on the LDCT performed, interpreted with the help of artificial intelligence.

Communication with patients can be challenging in the setting of busy radiology departments where there is a focus on efficient and accurate diagnosis. Traditionally, most results are provided directly to the referring clinician. However, the importance of direct communication between the radiologist and patient is increasingly relevant, particularly in the context of face-to-face settings such as rapid assessment and ultrasound clinics, and interventional radiology, as well as in written form through electronic patient portals. Artificial intelligence tools may improve efficiency, allowing more time for radiologists to communicate directly with patients. There is a need for dedicated training in communication skills for imaging professionals.

    "answer": "When considering who is at risk of developing lung cancer, the context provided points towards several crucial factors relevant to the understanding of lung cancer risk, lung cancer screening (LCS), and the role of radiologists and multidisciplinary teams in the early detection of this disease.\n\n**Lung Cancer Risk Factors:**\n1. **Smoking History:**\n   Cigarette smoking is the most significant risk factor for lung cancer, and this is implicit in the discussions about LCS and the need for such screenings. Smokers, as well as former smokers, are at increased risk.\n\n2. **Age:**\n   Most screening programs tend to target older populations, often those aged 55 and above, as the risk for lung cancer increases with age.\n\n3. **Exposure to Carcinogens:**\n   Individuals exposed to carcinogens like radon, asbestos, and environmental toxins may have a higher risk of developing lung cancer, which is why screening is particularly beneficial in detecting lung cancer early in these populations.\n\n4. **Personal or Family History:**\n   A history of lung cancer in the family or a personal history of lung disease can increase an individual's risk level.\n\n5. **Significant Reduction in Cancer-Related Mortality:**\n   The provided context mentions a significant reduction of cancer-related mortality by 26% in the Dutch-Belgian NELSON LCS trial, indicating the importance of LCS in at-risk populations.\n\n**Importance of Lung Cancer Screening:**\nResearch highlighted in the context emphasizes that LCS, particularly with low-dose computed tomography (CT), is capable of detecting lung cancers at earlier stages. When lung cancer is found early, such as stage 1A, patients have greater than a 75% 5-year survival rate as opposed to late-stage diagnosis when curative treatment might not be possible.\n\n**The Role of Radiologists and Multidisciplinary Teams:**\n1. **Radiologists:**\n   Radiologists play a key role beyond simple nodule detection. They are central in implementing a quality LCS program, including the interpretation of scans which can increasingly be assisted by artificial intelligence to improve accuracy and efficiency.\n\n2. **Multidisciplinary Teams:**\n   A collaborative approach involving pulmonologists, radiologists, and potentially other specialists is crucial to support the screening process, ensuring that patients receive comprehensive care.\n\n**Communication in LCS:**\nPatient communication is an essential element in the lung cancer screening process, as highlighted by the context. With the assistance of AI and digital technologies, radiologists may have more opportunities to communicate directly with patients, enhancing the quality and clarity of information shared.\n\nTherefore, those most at risk for lung cancer would include individuals who have a history of smoking, those of an older age group, individuals exposed to certain carcinogens, and those with a personal or family history of lung cancer. Effective LCS and clear communication strategies are vital for early detection and improving the outcomes for those at risk.",

    "context": "30544190<SEP>Angeline Chatelan<SEP>Precision nutrition: hype or hope for public health interventions to reduce obesity?<SEP>High-income countries are experiencing an obesity epidemic that follows a socioeconomic gradient, affecting groups of lower socioeconomic status disproportionately. Recent clinical findings have suggested new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of obesity, using personalized dietary approaches. Precision nutrition (PN), also called personalized nutrition, has been developed to deliver more preventive and practical dietary advice than 'one-size-fits-all' guidelines. With interventions becoming increasingly plausible at a large scale thanks to artificial intelligence and smartphone applications, some have begun to view PN as a novel way to deliver the right dietary intervention to the right population. We argue that large-scale PN, if taken alone, might be of limited interest from a public health perspective. Building on Geoffrey Rose's theory regarding the differences in individual and population causes of disease, we show that large-scale PN can only address some individual causes of obesity (causes of cases). This individual-centred approach is likely to have a small impact on the distribution of obesity at a population level because it ignores the population causes of obesity (causes of incidence). The latter are embedded in the populations' social, cultural, economic and political contexts that make environments obesogenic. Additionally, the most socially privileged groups in the population are the most likely to respond to large-scale PN interventions. This could have the undesirable effect of widening social inequalities in obesity. We caution public health actors that interventions based only on large-scale PN are unlikely, despite current expectations, to improve dietary intake or reduce obesity at a population level.34008960<SEP>Juliane R Sempionatto<SEP>Wearable and Mobile Sensors for Personalized Nutrition<SEP>While wearable and mobile chemical sensors have experienced tremendous growth over the past decade, their potential for tracking and guiding nutrition has emerged only over the past three years.

As people's understanding of health and disease continues to deepen, health was defined as a series of signs that can maintain physiologically dynamic and orderly characteristics and rely on more precise individualized guidance or intervention measures to sustain. \"Precision Nutrition\" uses various new technologies and concepts to examine multiple dimensions such as nutrition intake, lifestyle, phenotype, and genotype, to achieve personalized and accurate nutrition interventions, and contribute to the achievement of health in the new era. Nowadays, it is still needed to build multi-omics models, develop them more accurately, conveniently.

    "answer": "Given the context provided, there is a clear emphasis on the concept of \"Precision Nutrition\" (PN) as an evolving approach to healthy dietary planning. PN considers individual differences such as metabolic profiles, backgrounds, lifestyles, phenotypes, genotypes, and even socioeconomic factors, aiming to personalize dietary recommendations rather than applying general dietary guidelines meant for the average population.\n\n**Resources for Precision Nutrition:**\n\n1. **Academic Literature:** As indicated by authors such as Angeline Chatelan and Y Liu, and reviewers like Juliane R Sempionatto, academic publications can be a rich resource for understanding the principles and applications of PN. These can be accessed through scientific research databases such as PubMed.\n\n2. **Mobile and Wearable Technology:** Technologies described by Sempionatto, including calorie-counting apps and wearable motion tracking devices, provide personalized feedback on nutritional intake and physical activity. These are accessible through app stores or device manufacturers.\n\n3. **Nutrition Professionals:** Medical professionals, especially those specialized in personalized dietary advice, can help craft individual plans. These professionals are likely to be aware of and utilize PN concepts in their recommendations.\n\n4. **Public Health Information:** While there is a caution regarding the limited impact of PN at the population level if not coupled with broader socioeconomic interventions, public health resources and campaigns may still provide important contextual information for PN.\n\n5. **Nutritional Databases:** Online databases and tools that provide details about the nutritional content of various foods can be helpful when used in conjunction with PN principles.\n\n6. **Artificial Intelligence Platforms:** AI, as mentioned across the provided literature, plays a significant role in synthesizing individual data to provide tailored nutritional advice. Platforms leveraging AI for PN are likely accessible online or through some health service providers.\n\n7. **Multi-Omics Models and Data Integration:** For a cutting-edge approach, resources that include genomics, phenomics, metabolomics, and other 'omics data can provide a deep level of personalization in nutrition planning. Tools and companies offering such services integrate multi-dimensional data sets through AI.\n\n**Note on Public Health Implications of PN:**\n\nIt's crucial to note, as Angeline Chatelan points out, that solely relying on PN may overlook broader social determinants of health and could inadvertently increase social inequalities in obesity due to differential uptake and response to PN interventions by various socioeconomic groups. Therefore, while seeking resources for healthy dietary plans through the lens of PN, the broader social and environmental factors impacting diet and health should also be considered to ensure equitable access and effects across populations.",

    "context": "35595533<SEP>Satoshi Kidoguchi<SEP>Antihypertensive Drugs and Cancer Risk<SEP>Hypertension is the most prevalent comorbidity in cancer patients. Consequently, many cancer patients are prescribed antihypertensive drugs before cancer diagnosis or during cancer treatment. However, whether antihypertensive drugs affect the incidence, treatment efficacy, or prognosis of cancer remains unanswered. For instance, renin-angiotensin and \u03b2-adrenergic signaling may be involved not only in blood pressure elevation but also in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tissue invasion. Therefore, the inhibition of these pathways may have beneficial effects on cancer prevention or treatment. In this article, we reviewed several studies regarding antihypertensive drugs and cancer. In particular, we focused on the results of clinical trials to evaluate whether the use of antihypertensive drugs affects future cancer risk and prognosis. Unfortunately, the results are somewhat inconsistent, and evidence demonstrating the effect of antihypertensive drugs remains limited. We indicate that the heterogeneity in the study designs makes it difficult to clarify the causal relationship between antihypertensive drugs and cancer. We also propose that additional experimental studies, including research with induced pluripotent cells derived from cancer patients, single-cell analyses of cancer cell clusters, and clinical studies using artificial intelligence electronic health record systems, might be helpful to reveal the precise association between antihypertensive drugs and cancer risk.37493402<SEP>Rohit Gagare<SEP>AndroPred: an artificial intelligence-based model for predicting androgen receptor inhibitors<SEP>Androgen receptor (AR), a steroid receptor, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (PCa). AR controls the transcription of genes that help cells avoid apoptosis and proliferate, thereby contributing to the development of PCa. Understanding AR molecular mechanisms has led to the development of newer drugs that inhibit androgen production enzymes or block ARs. The FDA has approved a small number of AR-inhibiting drugs for use in PCa thus far, as the identification of novel AR inhibitors is difficult, expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. To accelerate the process, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms were employed to predict AR inhibitors using a dataset of 2242 compounds. Four machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms were used to train different prediction models based on molecular descriptors (1D, 2D, and molecular fingerprints). The DL-based prediction model outperformed the other trained models with accuracies of 92.18% and 93.05% on the training and test datasets, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of DL, particularly the DNN model, as an effective approach for predicting AR inhibitors, which could significantly streamline the process of identifying novel AR inhibitors in PCa drug discovery. Further validation of these models using experimental assays and prospective testing of newly designed compounds would be valuable to confirm their predictive power and applicability in practical drug discovery settings.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.32962608<SEP>Dongsheng Hong<SEP>Improvement in Hypertension Management with Pharmacological and Non- Pharmacological Approaches: Current Perspectives<SEP>Purpose: Improving hypertension management is still one of the biggest challenges in public health worldwide. Existing guidelines do not reach a consensus on the optimal Blood Pressure (BP) target. Therefore, how to effectively manage hypertension based on individual characteristics of patients, combined with the pharmacological and non-pharmacological approach, has become a problem to be urgently considered. Methods: Reports published in PubMed that covered Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Approaches in subjects taking hypertension management were reviewed by the group independently and collectively. Practical recommendations for hypertension management were established by the panel. Results: Pharmacological mechanism, action characteristics, and main adverse reactions varied across different pharmacological agents, and patients with hypertension often require a combination of antihypertensive medications to achieve the target BP range. Non-pharmacological treatment provides an additional effective method for improving therapy adherence and long-term BP control, thus reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and slowing down the progression of the disease. Conclusion: This review summarizes the available literature on the most convincing guideline principles, pharmacological treatment, biotechnology interference, interventional surgical treatment, managing hypertension with technical means of big data, Artificial Intelligence and Behavioral Intervention, as well as providing future directions, for facilitating Current and Developing knowledge into clinical implementation.37300317<SEP>Mohanad Alkhodari<SEP>The role of artificial intelligence in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: towards personalized healthcare<SEP>Introduction: Guidelines advise ongoing follow-up of patients after hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) to assess cardiovascular risk and manage future patient-specific pregnancy conditions. However, there are limited tools available to monitor patients, with those available tending to be simple risk assessments that lack personalization. A promising approach could be the emerging artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, developed from big patient datasets to provide personalized recommendations for preventive advice. Areas covered: In this narrative review, we discuss the impact of integrating AI and big data analysis for personalized cardiovascular care, focusing on the management of HDP. Expert opinion: The pathophysiological response of women to pregnancy varies, and deeper insight into each response can be gained through a deeper analysis of the medical history of pregnant women based on clinical records and imaging data. Further research is required to be able to implement AI for clinical cases using multi-modality and multi-organ assessment, and this could expand both knowledge on pregnancy-related disorders and personalized treatment planning.",
    "answer": "The primary impact of hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, on the body is damage to the cardiovascular system. Hypertension can lead to severe health complications as it places additional strain on the blood vessels and the heart. Over time, the increased pressure can damage these structures and result in various serious conditions. Here are some of the ways hypertension affects the body, each providing a perspective relevant to the provided context information:\n\n1. **Increased risk of cardiovascular diseases**: As indicated in PubMed report 32962608 by Dongsheng Hong, hypertension is a significant factor in the progression of cardiovascular diseases. Persistent high blood pressure can lead to atherosclerosis, where the arteries become narrowed and hardened, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke. Moreover, because hypertension often requires a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to manage it effectively, it also emphasizes the importance of achieving target blood pressure ranges to reduce the risk of such diseases.\n\n2. **Effect on cancer patients**: The context from Satoshi Kidoguchi's article with reference number 35595533 discusses the prevalence of hypertension among cancer patients and the implications of antihypertensive drugs on cancer. Hypertension doesn't just affect blood pressure regulation; it also interacts with cell proliferation and tissue invasion, which are critical factors in cancer progression. The intersection between antihypertensive therapy and cancer incidence or treatment outcomes is complex and points to the possibility that managing hypertension could have ancillary effects on cancer prevention or treatment.\n\n3. **Role in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP)**: The narrative review represented by Mohanad Alkhodari, number 37300317, highlights how hypertension can impact pregnancy outcomes. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are a significant concern and can present unique risks to both mother and fetus, including the risk of cardiovascular disease later in the mother's life. AI-science-assisted personalization of health care, including HDP management, indicates the potential for better understanding and mitigating the risks associated with hypertension in pregnant patients.\n\n4. **Influence on drug discovery for related diseases**: In Rohit Gagare's entry 37493402, the role of AI in predicting androgen receptor inhibitors for the treatment of prostate cancer is noted. While this context does not directly discuss hypertension, it underscores the utility of AI in advancing medical treatments that could implicitly affect patients with hypertension. Such AI-facilitated drug discoveries can lead to new therapies that may influence the management of hypertensive patients with comorbid conditions like prostate cancer.\n\nIn summary, the primary impact of hypertension on the body is its potential to damage the cardiovascular system, contributing to multiple health issues including heart disease, stroke, and complications in cancer and pregnancy. The evidence indicates that a comprehensive approach combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, as well as leveraging advances in AI and big data, can improve the management and outcomes for patients with hypertension.",

Materials and methods: Data from two large cancer registries (registry A & B) the Northern and Yorkshire Cancer Registry Information Service (NYCRIS) and the West Midlands Cancer Intelligence Unit (WMCIU) from 1998-2003 for all cases of invasive breast cancer of either pure ductal or pure lobular reported histology were obtained. The invasive status of the contralateral tumour diagnosis and tumour morphology was collected. Chi-square tests were undertaken to examine the differences in contralateral rates for both registries and univariate analysis to ascertain which predictors affected contralateral breast cancer risk for registry A the WMCIU cases. Results: A total of 38,132 patients were studied, 32,735 patients with IDC and 5397 (14.2%) patients with ILC over the 6-year period. There was no significant difference between the occurrence and time to occurrence of contralateral breast cancer according to original cancer histology, 901 (2.8%) patients with IDC versus 166 (3.1%) patients with ILC (p=0.169). The analysis of registry A cases showed no association between original histology (ductal versus lobular), age at diagnosis, tumour grade, use of radiotherapy for the primary cancer or use of systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy), and development of a contralateral breast cancer. Conclusion: There is no apparent increase in risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer according to the primary cancer histology either IDC or ILC. Standard mammographic follow-up does not need to take account of original tumour pathology. Increased intervention or post-treatment surveillance for the contralateral breast is not indicated in the context of ILC. The role of MRI should be restricted to those patients with ILC who are planning breast-conservation surgery, but not for assessing the contralateral breast.38084492<SEP>Filippo Pesapane<SEP>Advances in breast cancer risk modeling: integrating clinics, imaging, pathology and artificial intelligence for personalized risk assessment<SEP>Breast cancer risk models represent the likelihood of developing breast cancer based on risk factors. They enable personalized interventions to improve screening programs. Radiologists identify mammographic density as a significant risk factor and test new imaging techniques. Pathologists provide data for risk assessment. Clinicians conduct individual risk assessments and adopt prevention strategies for high-risk subjects. Tumor genetic testing guides personalized screening and treatment decisions. Artificial intelligence in mammography integrates imaging, clinical, genetic and pathological data to develop risk models. Emerging imaging technologies, genetic testing and molecular profiling improve risk model accuracy. The complexity of the disease, limited data availability and model inputs are discussed. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for earlier detection and improved outcomes.27441717<SEP>Jennifer G Stadler<SEP>Improving the Efficiency and Ease of Healthcare Analysis Through Use of Data Visualization Dashboards<SEP>The digitization of a patient's health record has profoundly impacted medicine and healthcare. The compilation and accessibility of medical history has provided clinicians an unprecedented, holistic account of a patient's conditions, procedures, medications, family history, and social situation. In addition to the bedside benefits, this level of information has opened the door for population-level monitoring and research, the results of which can be used to guide initiatives that are aimed at improving quality of care. Cerner Corporation partners with health systems to help guide population management and quality improvement projects. With such an enormous and diverse client base-varying in geography, size, organizational structure, and analytic needs-discerning meaning in the data and how they fit with that particular hospital's goals is a slow, difficult task that requires clinical, statistical, and technical literacy. This article describes the development of dashboards for efficient data visualization at the healthcare facility level. Focusing on two areas with broad clinical importance, sepsis patient outcomes and 30-day hospital readmissions, dashboards were developed with the goal of aggregating data and providing meaningful summary statistics, highlighting critical performance metrics, and providing easily digestible visuals that can be understood by a wide range of personnel with varying levels of skill and areas of expertise. These internal-use dashboards have allowed associates in multiple roles to perform a quick and thorough assessment on a hospital of interest by providing the data to answer necessary questions and to identify important trends or opportunities. This automation of a previously manual process has greatly increased efficiency, saving hours of work time per hospital analyzed. Additionally, the dashboards have standardized the analysis process, ensuring use of the same metrics and processes so that overall themes can be compared across hospitals and health systems.37200923<SEP>Mona P Tan<SEP>The unifying concepts of the sick lobe hypothesis, field cancerisation and breast conservation treatment for multiple ipsilateral breast cancers: a narrative review<SEP>Background and objective: In the past, it was conventionally thought that multiple ipsilateral breast cancer (MIBC) was a contraindication to breast conservation surgery, especially if multicentric foci in different quadrants of the breast were present. However, over time, there has been a growing body of evidence in the literature demonstrating no survival detriment or poorer local control with breast conservation for MIBC. There is, however, a paucity of information integrating anatomy, pathology with surgical treatment of MIBC. Understanding mammary anatomy, pathology of the sick lobe hypothesis and molecular impact of field cancerisation contributes significantly to the understanding of the role of surgical treatment of MIBC. The purpose of this narrative overview is to review the paradigm shifts over time in the use of breast conservation treatment (BCT) for MIBC, and how the concepts of the sick lobe hypothesis and field cancerisation interact with this therapeutic strategy. A secondary objective is to explore the feasibility of surgical de-escalation for BCT in the presence of MIBC. Methods: A PubMed search was performed for articles relating to BCT, multifocal, multicentric and MIBC. A separate literature search was performed for sick lobe hypothesis and field cancerisation and their interaction for surgical treatment for breast cancer. The available data was then analysed and synergised into a coherent summary of how the molecular and histologic aspects of MIBC interact with surgical therapy. Key content and findings: There is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of BCT for MIBC. However, there is scant data connecting the basic science aspects of breast cancer in terms of pathology and genetics to adequacy of surgical extirpation of breast malignancies. This review bridges this gap by demonstrating how information on basic sciences available in contemporary literature can be extrapolated for use in artificial intelligence (AI) systems to assist in BCT for MIBC. Conclusions: This narrative review connects several aspects of the surgical treatment for MIBC: historical perspectives of therapy compared with contemporary philosophy based on clinical evidence, anatomy/pathology (sick lobe hypothesis) and molecular findings (field cancerisation) as potential indicators of adequate surgical resection, and how current technology can be used to forge future AI applications in breast cancer surgery. These form the foundation for future research to safely de-escalate surgery for women with MIBC.",
    "answer": "The most prevalent type of cancer is not directly specified within the context provided, but we can infer from the information that the focus is largely on breast cancer, discussing its various aspects, subtypes, risk assessment, and treatment strategies.\n\nTo answer the original question \"Which cancer type is most prevalent?\" we must look to epidemiological data in the general population.

Integrated care pathways that prescribe timeframes around access and interventions can potentially improve quality of care. Methods and analysis: A multicentre mixed methods study to assess feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness and analysis of direct costs of an integrated care pathway for psychosis. A pragmatic, non-randomised, controlled trial design is used to compare the impact of Treatment and Recovery In PsycHosis (TRIumPH; Intervention) by comparison between NHS organisations that adopt TRIumPH and those that continue with care as usual (Control). Quantitative and qualitative methods will be used. We will use routinely collected quantitative data and study-specific questionnaires and focus groups to compare service user outcomes, satisfaction and adherence to intervention between sites that adopt TRIumPH versus sites that continue with usual care pathways. Setting: 4 UK Mental health organisations. Two will implement TRIumPH whereas two will continue care as usual. Participants: Staff, carers, individuals accepted to early intervention in psychosis teams in participating organisations for the study period. Intervention: TRIumPH-Integrated Care Pathway for psychosis that has a holistic approach and prescribes time frames against interventions; developed using intelligence from data; co-produced with patients, carers, clinicians and other stakeholders. Outcomes: Feasibility will be assessed through adherence to the process measures. Satisfaction and acceptability will be assessed using questionnaires and focus groups. Effectiveness will be assessed through data collection and evaluation of patient outcomes, including clinical, functional and recovery outcomes, physical health, acute care use. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, 12 and 24 months to measure whether there is an effect and if so, whether this is sustained over time. Outcomes measures at the adopter sites will be compared to their own baseline and against comparator sites.

There is good evidence that SMIs have a strong genetic background and are characterized by multiple biological alterations, including disturbed brain circuits and connectivity, dysregulated neuronal excitation-inhibition, disturbed dopaminergic and glutamatergic pathways, and partially dysregulated inflammatory processes. The ways in which the dysregulated signaling pathways are interconnected remains largely unknown, in part because well-characterized clinical studies on comprehensive biomaterial are lacking. Furthermore, the development of drugs to treat SMIs such as schizophrenia is limited by the use of operationalized symptom-based clusters for diagnosis. Methods: In line with the Research Domain Criteria initiative, the Clinical Deep Phenotyping (CDP) study is using a multimodal approach to reveal the neurobiological underpinnings of clinically relevant schizophrenia subgroups by performing broad transdiagnostic clinical characterization with standardized neurocognitive assessments, multimodal neuroimaging, electrophysiological assessments, retinal investigations, and omics-based analyzes of blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, to bridge the translational gap in biological psychiatry the study includes in vitro investigations on human-induced pluripotent stem cells, which are available from a subset of participants. Results: Here, we report on the feasibility of this multimodal approach, which has been successfully initiated in the first participants in the CDP cohort; to date, the cohort comprises over 194 individuals with SMI and 187 age and gender matched healthy controls. In addition, we describe the applied research modalities and study objectives. Discussion: The identification of cross-diagnostic and diagnosis-specific biotype-informed subgroups of patients and the translational dissection of those subgroups may help to pave the way toward precision medicine with artificial intelligence-supported tailored interventions and treatment. This aim is particularly important in psychiatry, a field where innovation is urgently needed because specific symptom domains, such as negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction, and treatment-resistant symptoms in general are still difficult to treat.23795956<SEP>Barbara Griffin<SEP>The Undergraduate Medical and Health Sciences Admissions Test: what is it measuring?<SEP>Background: The Undergraduate Medical and Health Sciences Admissions Test (UMAT) is used to select medical students in Australia and New Zealand but empirical evidence of its construct validity has never been reported. Aims: To identify the underlying constructs assessed in each of the three sections of the UMAT. Based on conclusions from an early qualitative study (Mercer & Chiavaroli 2006), it was expected that Section 1 scores would correlate with scores obtained from standard measures of cognitive ability (verbal and numeric reasoning), Section 2 scores would correlate with emotional intelligence, and Section 3 scores would be most strongly related to abstract or non-verbal reasoning ability. Method: Final year high school students (n = 432) completed tests of numerical, verbal, and non-verbal cognitive ability, and emotional intelligence. Correlations and multiple regressions assessed the relationship of these tests with scores on each section of the UMAT. Results: UMAT Section 1 was significantly related to verbal, non-verbal, and numerical reasoning tests. Section 2 was significantly related to emotional intelligence and verbal reasoning, but the majority of variance in this section's scores remained unexplained. Section 3 scores significantly correlated with non-verbal and numerical reasoning. Conclusions: The UMAT Sections 1 and 3 appear to be tests of cognitive abilities.

The Multiple Mini Interview (MMI) was used in one university as a way of ensuring that candidates had the appropriate numeracy and literacy skills as well as a range of communication, empathy, decision-making and problem-solving skills as well as ethical insights and integrity, initiative and team-work. Objectives: To ascertain whether there is evidence of bias in MMIs (gender, age, nationality and location of secondary education) and to determine the extent to which the MMI is predictive of academic success in nursing. Design: A longitudinal retrospective analysis of student demographics, MMI data and the assessment marks for years 1, 2 and 3. Settings: One university in southwest London. Participants: One cohort of students who commenced their programme in September 2011, including students in all four fields of nursing (adult, child, mental health and learning disability). Methods: Inferential statistics and a Bayesian Multilevel Model. Results: MMI in conjunction with MMI numeracy test and MMI literacy test shows little or no bias in terms of ages, gender, nationality or location of secondary school education. Although MMI in conjunction with numeracy and literacy testing is predictive of academic success, it is only weakly predictive. Conclusions: The MMI used in conjunction with literacy and numeracy testing appears to be a successful technique for selecting candidates for nursing. However, other selection methods such as psychological profiling or testing of emotional intelligence may add to the extent to which selection methods are predictive of academic success on nursing.",
    "answer": "Based on the context provided by the vector database IDs and the corresponding summaries, we can approach the original question\u2014At what point should medication be initiated for mental health disorders?\u2014from multiple perspectives related to the research and findings in the given context. Here's how relevant information from each context can inform an understanding and approach to the original question:\n\n**Duration of Untreated Psychosis & Integrated Care Pathways** (Shanaya Rathod's study): This study emphasizes that the duration of untreated psychosis is a strong predictor of symptom severity and outcome in mental health disorders. That suggests that early intervention with medication could potentially be crucial for improving patient outcomes in psychotic disorders. Integrated care pathways like TRIumPH aim to shorten the time between the onset of symptoms and the start of treatment, indicating that medication should be initiated promptly when psychosis is suspected or diagnosed.\n\n**Research Domain Criteria & Deep Phenotyping** (Lenka Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159's study): According to the research conducted by Lenka Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159, treatment-resistant symptoms and severe mental illness (SMI) require novel and innovative approaches, highlighting the complexity of treatment initiation and protocols. By identifying diagnosis-specific biotype-informed subgroups and personalized medicine approaches, this research suggests that the initiation of medication for mental health disorders should take into account individual neurobiological underpinnings, which may affect both timing and choice of medication.\n\n**Medical Admissions Testing/UMAT & Cognitive Abilities** (Barbara Griffin's research): Although Griffin's study pertains more to the selection of medical students than directly to clinical treatment decisions, it does touch on the importance of understanding cognitive and emotional intelligence for medical practice. This could extrapolate to a need for mental health professionals to have a deep understanding of patient cognitive and emotional functioning when deciding if and when to initiate medication.\n\n**Multiple Mini Interviews & Student Nurse Selection** (Julia Gale's research): While Gale's study focuses on nursing student selection, the use of Multiple Mini Interviews (MMI) to assess characteristics such as compassion and decision-making could reflect on how healthcare providers might approach patient care. In terms of medication initiation for mental health disorders, it underscores the importance of a holistic view of the patient, including their emotional and cognitive state, before making treatment decisions.\n\nIntegrating these perspectives, we can surmise that the initiation of medication for mental health disorders should ideally be:\n\n1. Prompt, particularly in cases of psychosis to prevent severe symptomatology and improve outcomes.\n2. Tailored, with an awareness that different mental health disorders and even subtypes within those disorders may require specific treatment strategies.\n3. Informed, considering a patient\u2019s unique biological, genetic, cognitive, and emotional profile to choose the most effective treatment course.\n4. Holistic, acknowledging the complexity of mental health and the importance of empathy, integrity, and communication in patient care.\n\nIt is important to consult with psychiatric and clinical professionals when determining the appropriate time to start medication for mental health disorders. Clinical guidelines, patient preferences, existing comorbidities, and individual patient circumstances also play vital roles in this decision-making process.",

    "question": "Who should be consulted prior to antibiotic administration?",
    "context": "34654462<SEP>Marin H Kollef<SEP>Timing of antibiotic therapy in the ICU<SEP>Severe or life threatening infections are common among patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most infections in the ICU are bacterial or fungal in origin and require antimicrobial therapy for clinical resolution. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of therapy for infected critically ill patients. However, antibiotics are often not optimally administered resulting in less favorable patient outcomes including greater mortality. The timing of antibiotics in patients with life threatening infections including sepsis and septic shock is now recognized as one of the most important determinants of survival for this population. Individuals who have a delay in the administration of antibiotic therapy for serious infections can have a doubling or more in their mortality. Additionally, the timing of an appropriate antibiotic regimen, one that is active against the offending pathogens based on in vitro susceptibility, also influences survival. Thus not only is early empiric antibiotic administration important but the selection of those agents is crucial as well. The duration of antibiotic infusions, especially for \u03b2-lactams, can also influence antibiotic efficacy by increasing antimicrobial drug exposure for the offending pathogen. However, due to mounting antibiotic resistance, aggressive antimicrobial de-escalation based on microbiology results is necessary to counterbalance the pressures of early broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In this review, we examine time related variables impacting antibiotic optimization as it relates to the treatment of life threatening infections in the ICU. In addition to highlighting the importance of antibiotic timing in the ICU we hope to provide an approach to antimicrobials that also minimizes the unnecessary use of these agents. Such approaches will increasingly be linked to advances in molecular microbiology testing and artificial intelligence/machine learning. Such advances should help identify patients needing empiric antibiotic therapy at an earlier time point as well as the specific antibiotics required in order to avoid unnecessary administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.37732791<SEP>Jae Jung<SEP>Using antibiotics wisely<SEP>Purpose of review: This review will describe role of shorter antibiotic therapies, early switch from intravenous to oral therapy, and artificial intelligence in infectious diseases. Recent findings: There is evidence that shorter courses of antibiotics are noninferior to standard durations of therapy. This has been demonstrated with Enterobacterales bacteremia that can be treated with 7 days of therapy, community acquired pneumonia with 3 days and ventilator associated pneumonia with just 7 days of antibiotic therapy. The conversion from intravenous to oral therapy in treating bacteremia, endocarditis and bone and joint infections is safe and effective and reduces line complications and costs. Also, for clean surgical procedures only one dose of antibiotic is needed, but it should be the most effective antibiotic which is cefazolin. This means avoiding clindamycin, removing penicillin allergies where possible for improved outcomes. Finally, the role of artificial intelligence to incorporate into using antibiotics wisely is rapidly emerging but is still in early stages. Summary: In using antibiotics wisely, targeting such as durations of therapy and conversion from intravenous antibiotic therapy to oral are low hanging fruit. The future of artificial intelligence could automate a lot of this work and is exciting but needs to be proven.

    "answer": "Based on the relevant context provided in the vector database, **consultation prior to antibiotic administration** is a multifaceted decision requiring input from various stakeholders. Here are the different perspectives derived from the context:\n\n**Clinical Perspective (Marin H. Kollef):**\nBefore administering antibiotics, especially in the ICU, it is critical to consult with a **medical professional with expertise in infectious diseases**. As suggested by the review on \"Timing of antibiotic therapy in the ICU\" by Marin H. Kollef, timing and the selection of appropriate antibiotics are crucial determinants of survival in severe infections. Immediate involvement of an infectious disease specialist can help ensure rapid and accurate initiation of antibiotics while considering the patient\u2019s specific condition.\n\n**Stewardship Perspective (Amy Chang):**\nFrom a stewardship point of view as discussed by Amy Chang, it is crucial to engage with an **antimicrobial stewardship team**, which may include pharmacists, microbiologists, and infectious disease experts. Their role includes helping to tailor antibiotic choices to the individual needs while minimizing the risk of resistance and unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic use. These professionals can navigate the delicate balance between timely treatment and the judicious use of antibiotics.\n\n**Innovation Perspective (Artificial Intelligence approaches):**\nAs artificial intelligence continues to evolve in the field of antibiotic stewardship, future systems may provide **real-time clinical decision support** as mentioned in both reviews by Jae Jung and Amy Chang. This can help guide healthcare practitioners toward more accurate and personalized antibiotic selection even before traditional culture results are available.\n\n**Best Practice Perspective (Jae Jung):**\nThe guidance from a clinician like Jae Jung suggests consultations before antibiotic administration should include considerations of **evidence-based practices for the duration and route of therapy**. This involves transitioning from intravenous to oral therapies when appropriate and adhering to shorter courses of treatment that have been proven effective. Expertise in current best practices is essential to optimize patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn summary, prior to the administration of antibiotics, a multi-disciplinary consultation is key, involving infectious disease physicians, the antimicrobial stewardship team, and in the future, potentially AI-driven decision tools that could provide real-time recommendations. These collaborations aim to ensure the judicious use of antibiotics to provide optimal care for the patient while also confronting the global challenge of antibiotic resistance.",

    "question": "What are the advantages of vaccination?",
    "context": "35060917<SEP>Camille Masselot<SEP>Implementing the Co-Immune Open Innovation Program to Address Vaccination Hesitancy and Access to Vaccines: Retrospective Study<SEP>Background: The rise of major complex public health problems, such as vaccination hesitancy and access to vaccination, requires innovative, open, and transdisciplinary approaches. Yet, institutional silos and lack of participation on the part of nonacademic citizens in the design of solutions hamper efforts to meet these challenges. Against this background, new solutions have been explored, with participatory research, citizen science, hackathons, and challenge-based approaches being applied in the context of public health. Objective: Our aim was to develop a program for creating citizen science and open innovation projects that address the contemporary challenges of vaccination in France and around the globe. Methods: We designed and implemented Co-Immune, a program created to tackle the question of vaccination hesitancy and access to vaccination through an online and offline challenge-based open innovation approach. The program was run on the open science platform Just One Giant Lab. Results: Over a 6-month period, the Co-Immune program gathered 234 participants of diverse backgrounds and 13 partners from the public and private sectors. The program comprised 10 events to facilitate the creation of 20 new projects, as well as the continuation of two existing projects, to address the issues of vaccination hesitancy and access, ranging from app development and data mining to analysis and game design. In an open framework, the projects made their data, code, and solutions publicly available. Conclusions: Co-Immune highlights how open innovation approaches and online platforms can help to gather and coordinate noninstitutional communities in a rapid, distributed, and global way toward solving public health issues. Such initiatives can lead to the production and transfer of knowledge, creating novel solutions in the public health sector. The example of Co-Immune contributes to paving the way for organizations and individuals to collaboratively tackle future global challenges.33549263<SEP>Naveen L Pereira<SEP>COVID-19: Understanding Inter-Individual Variability and Implications for Precision Medicine<SEP>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by heterogeneity in susceptibility to the disease and severity of illness. Understanding inter-individual variation has important implications for not only allocation of resources but also targeting patients for escalation of care, inclusion in clinical trials, and individualized medical therapy including vaccination. In addition to geographic location and social vulnerability, there are clear biological differences such as age, sex, race, presence of comorbidities, underlying genetic variation, and differential immune response that contribute to variability in disease manifestation. These differences may have implications for precision medicine. Specific examples include the observation that androgens regulate the expression of the enzyme transmembrane protease, serine 2 which facilitates severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral entry into the cell; therefore, androgen deprivation therapy is being explored as a treatment option in males infected with COVID-19. An immunophenotyping study of COVID-19 patients has shown that a subset develop T cytopenia which has prompted a clinical trial that is testing the efficacy of interleukin-7 in these patients. Predicting which COVID-19 patients will develop progressive disease that will require hospitalization has important implications for clinical trials that target outpatients. Enrollment of patients at low risk for progression of disease and hospitalization would likely not result in such therapy demonstrating efficacy. There are efforts to use artificial intelligence to integrate digital data from smartwatch applications or digital monitoring systems and biological data to enable identification of the high risk COVID-19 patient. The ultimate goal of precision medicine using such modern technology is to recognize individual differences to improve health for all.33503001<SEP>Theresa Bernardo<SEP>Collaborating in the Time of COVID-19: The Scope and Scale of Innovative Responses to a Global Pandemic<SEP>The emergence of COVID-19 spurred the formation of myriad teams to tackle every conceivable aspect of the virus and thwart its spread. Enabled by global digital connectedness, collaboration has become a constant theme throughout the pandemic, resulting in the expedition of the scientific process (including vaccine development), rapid consolidation of global outbreak data and statistics, and experimentation with novel partnerships. To document the evolution of these collaborative efforts, the authors collected illustrative examples as the pandemic unfolded, supplemented with publications from the JMIR COVID-19 Special Issue. Over 60 projects rooted in collaboration are categorized into five main themes: knowledge dissemination, data propagation, crowdsourcing, artificial intelligence, and hardware design and development. They highlight the numerous ways that citizens, industry professionals, researchers, and academics have come together worldwide to consolidate information and produce products to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, researchers and citizen scientists scrambled to access quality data within an overwhelming quantity of information. As global curated data sets emerged, derivative works such as visualizations or models were developed that depended on consistent data and would fail when there were unanticipated changes. Crowdsourcing was used to collect and analyze data, aid in contact tracing, and produce personal protective equipment by sharing open designs for 3D printing. An international consortium of entrepreneurs and researchers created a ventilator based on an open-source design. A coalition of nongovernmental organizations and governmental organizations, led by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, created a shared open resource of over 200,000 research publications about COVID-19 and subsequently offered cash prizes for the best solutions to 17 key questions involving artificial intelligence. A thread of collaboration weaved throughout the pandemic response, which will shape future efforts. Novel partnerships will cross boundaries to create better processes, products, and solutions to consequential societal challenges.37766916<SEP>Daniel W Hook<SEP>The pandemic veneer: COVID-19 research as a mobilisation of collective intelligence by the global research community<SEP>The global research community responded with speed and at scale to the emergence of COVID-19, with around 4.6% of all research outputs in 2020 related to the pandemic. That share almost doubled through 2021, to reach 8.6% of research outputs. This reflects a dramatic mobilisation of global collective intelligence in the face of a crisis. It also raises fundamental questions about the funding, organisation and operation of research. In this Perspective article, we present data that suggests that COVID-19 research reflects the characteristics of the underlying networks from which it emerged, and on which it built. The infrastructures on which COVID-19 research has relied - including highly skilled, flexible research capacity and collaborative networks - predated the pandemic, and are the product of sustained, long-term investment. As such, we argue that COVID-19 research should not be viewed as a distinct field, or one-off response to a specific crisis, but as a 'pandemic veneer' layered on top of longstanding interdisciplinary networks, capabilities and structures. These infrastructures of collective intelligence need to be better understood, valued and sustained as crucial elements of future pandemic or crisis response.",

    "answer": "In the context of diabetes, the term \"forms\" of diabetes can refer to different types or complications of the condition. From the relevant context provided in the vector database, we can focus on the six significant complications of diabetes mentioned (which are often a point of focus in the management and prediction models developed using artificial intelligence mentioned in the context) while also providing a general overview of the primary types of diabetes. Here's an explanation that incorporates various perspectives:\n\n**Types of Diabetes:**\n1. **Type 1 Diabetes:** An autoimmune disease where the body's immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Individuals with type 1 diabetes require lifelong insulin therapy.\n2. **Type 2 Diabetes:** The most common form of diabetes, characterized by insulin resistance, where the body does not use insulin properly. It often correlates with lifestyle factors such as obesity, and sometimes progresses to the point where insulin or other medications are required.\n3. **Gestational Diabetes:** A form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy and usually resolves after childbirth, but increases the mother's risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.\n4. **Monogenic Diabetes:** A rare form that results from mutations in a single gene and includes maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and neonatal diabetes mellitus.\n\n**Complications of Diabetes:**\nThe context given emphasizes the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting and diagnosing various diabetes complications. Some of these include:\n1. **Gestational Diabetes:** Using AI to predict and diagnose gestational diabetes can improve outcomes for both mothers and children.\n2. **Hypoglycemia in the Hospital:** AI can help diagnose and manage hypoglycemia (dangerously low blood sugar levels) in hospitalized patients.\n3. **Diabetic Retinopathy:** An eye disease that can result in vision loss; AI can assist with early detection and treatment planning.\n4. **Diabetic Foot Ulcers:** AI can aid in predicting and diagnosing foot ulcers, which can prevent severe infections and amputations.\n5. **Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy:** Damage to nerves caused by diabetes can lead to loss of sensation in extremities; AI may help predict its development.\n6. **Diabetic Nephropathy:** AI can be instrumental in predicting kidney damage due to diabetes, allowing for timely interventions.\n\nIn summary, there are several primary types of diabetes, each with its own causes and treatment approaches. The applications of AI mentioned in the given context focus on predicting and diagnosing various complications, which are critical for improving patient outcomes and preventing further health issues associated with diabetes. AI-driven approaches, such as machine learning methods which include support vector machines and naive Bayesian, show promise in enhancing the screening, diagnosis, and treatment decision-making process for diabetic complications.",

The lack of databases on interactions between the immune system and NMs affects the discovery of new NMs for immunotherapy. Complement activation and inhibition by NMs have been widely studied, but the general rules remain unclear. Biomimetic nanocoating to promote the clearance of NMs by the immune system is an alternative strategy for the immune response mediation of the biological corona. Immune response predictions based on NM properties can facilitate the design of NMs for immunotherapy, and artificial intelligences deserve much attention in the field. This review addresses the knowledge gaps regarding immune response and immunotherapy in relation to NMs, effective immunotherapy and material design without adverse immune responses.37378614<SEP>Alap Ali Zahid<SEP>Tailoring the Inherent Properties of Biobased Nanoparticles for Nanomedicine<SEP>Biobased nanoparticles are at the leading edge of the rapidly developing field of nanomedicine and biotherapeutics. Their unique size, shape, and biophysical properties make them attractive tools for biomedical research, including vaccination, targeted drug delivery, and immune therapy. These nanoparticles are engineered to present native cell receptors and proteins on their surfaces, providing a biomimicking camouflage for therapeutic cargo to evade rapid degradation, immune rejection, inflammation, and clearance. Despite showing promising clinical relevance, commercial implementation of these biobased nanoparticles is yet to be fully realized. In this perspective, we discuss advanced biobased nanoparticle designs used in medical applications, such as cell membrane nanoparticles, exosomes, and synthetic lipid-derived nanoparticles, and highlight their benefits and potential challenges. Moreover, we critically assess the future of preparing such particles using artificial intelligence and machine learning. These advanced computational tools will be able to predict the functional composition and behavior of the proteins and cell receptors present on the nanoparticle surfaces. With more advancement in designing new biobased nanoparticles, this field of research could play a key role in dictating the future rational design of drug transporters, thereby ultimately improving overall therapeutic outcomes.32254089<SEP>Dean Ho<SEP>Artificial intelligence in nanomedicine<SEP>The field of nanomedicine has made substantial strides in the areas of therapeutic and diagnostic development. For example, nanoparticle-modified drug compounds and imaging agents have resulted in markedly enhanced treatment outcomes and contrast efficiency. In recent years, investigational nanomedicine platforms have also been taken into the clinic, with regulatory approval for Abraxane\u00ae and other products being awarded. As the nanomedicine field has continued to evolve, multifunctional approaches have been explored to simultaneously integrate therapeutic and diagnostic agents onto a single particle, or deliver multiple nanomedicine-functionalized therapies in unison. Similar to the objectives of conventional combination therapy, these strategies may further improve treatment outcomes through targeted, multi-agent delivery that preserves drug synergy. Also, similar to conventional/unmodified combination therapy, nanomedicine-based drug delivery is often explored at fixed doses. A persistent challenge in all forms of drug administration is that drug synergy is time-dependent, dose-dependent and patient-specific at any given point of treatment. To overcome this challenge, the evolution towards nanomedicine-mediated co-delivery of multiple therapies has made the potential of interfacing artificial intelligence (AI) with nanomedicine to sustain optimization in combinatorial nanotherapy a reality. Specifically, optimizing drug and dose parameters in combinatorial nanomedicine administration is a specific area where AI can actionably realize the full potential of nanomedicine. To this end, this review will examine the role that AI can have in substantially improving nanomedicine-based treatment outcomes, particularly in the context of combination nanotherapy for both N-of-1 and population-optimized treatment.37567505<SEP>Xianghe Jiang<SEP>Biomembrane nanostructures: Multifunctional platform to enhance tumor chemoimmunotherapy via effective drug delivery<SEP>Chemotherapeutic drugs have been found to activate the immune response against tumors by inducing immunogenic cell death, in addition to their direct cytotoxic effects toward tumors, therefore broadening the application of chemotherapy in tumor immunotherapy. The combination of other therapeutic strategies, such as phototherapy or radiotherapy, could further strengthen the therapeutic effects of immunotherapy. Nanostructures can facilitate multimodal tumor therapy by integrating various active agents and combining multiple types of therapeutics in a single nanostructure. Biomembrane nanostructures (e.g., exosomes and cell membrane-derived nanostructures), characterized by superior biocompatibility, intrinsic targeting ability, intelligent responsiveness and immune-modulating properties, could realize superior chemoimmunotherapy and represent next-generation nanostructures for tumor immunotherapy. This review summarizes recent advances in biomembrane nanostructures in tumor chemoimmunotherapy and highlights different types of engineering approaches and therapeutic mechanisms. A series of engineering strategies for combining different biomembrane nanostructures, including liposomes, exosomes, cell membranes and bacterial membranes, are summarized. The combination strategy can greatly enhance the targeting, intelligence and functionality of biomembrane nanostructures for chemoimmunotherapy, thereby serving as a stronger tumor therapeutic method.

Nevertheless, it's important to connect the general knowledge about vitamins and immune health with the specifics of the context to offer a comprehensive response.\n\n**Vitamins Crucial for Immune System:**\n1. **Vitamin C**: An essential antioxidant, it can support various cellular functions of the immune system and is known to enhance the function of immune cells.\n2. **Vitamin D**: Plays an integral role in immune function and can modulate innate and adaptive immune responses.\n3. **Vitamin E**: Another antioxidant that helps to maintain immune system function, especially in older adults.\n4. **Vitamin B6**: Involved in immune cell proliferation and antibody production.\n5. **Vitamin A**: Helps regulate the immune system and protect against infections by keeping skin and tissues in the mouth, stomach, intestines, and respiratory system healthy.\n6. **Folate (Vitamin B9)**: Essential for creating new cells, including immune cells.\n7. **Vitamin B12**: Involved in the production of immune system cells.\n\n**Context Relevance to Immune System and Nanomedicine:**\nThe provided literature snippets do not directly discuss the role of vitamins in the immune system; instead, they highlight advanced developments in nanomedicine and their interactions with the immune system for therapeutic purposes. For example, the use of biomimetic nanocoating and biomembrane nanostructures in immunotherapy showcases how nanotechnological advancements can leverage the natural properties of immune responses to target diseases like cancer more precisely. The potential for AI to predict and optimize these interactions represents an emerging frontier in this field.\n\n**Combining Perspectives:**\nA robust immune system is an asset in both traditional health maintenance and the context of advanced immunotherapies. While vitamins provide fundamental support for the immune system, the mentioned research areas focus on harnessing and guiding the immune system at a more targeted and molecular level using engineered nanomaterials. AI applications in predicting immune responses to these nanomaterials could potentially inform the development of combination therapies that might benefit from the foundational support of adequate vitamin levels, as well as precise biomedical interventions.\n\nTherefore, understanding the basics of immune support through vitamins is complementary to comprehending the complex dynamics of nanomedicine and immunotherapy. Both approaches, foundational nutrition and advanced medical interventions, are critical to fostering a robust and responsive immune system.",

    "context": "38146116<SEP>Darije Custovic<SEP>Understanding progression from pre-school wheezing to school-age asthma: Can modern data approaches help?<SEP>Preschool wheezing and childhood asthma create a heavy disease burden which is only exacerbated by the complexity of the conditions. Preschool wheezing exhibits both \"curricular\" and \"aetiological\" heterogeneity: that is, heterogeneity across patients both in the time-course of its development and in its underpinning pathological mechanisms. Since these are not fully understood, but clinical presentations across patients may nonetheless be similar, current diagnostic labels are imprecise-not mapping cleanly onto underlying disease mechanisms-and prognoses uncertain. These uncertainties also make a identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention difficult. In the past few decades, carefully designed birth cohort studies have collected \"big data\" on a large scale, incorporating not only a wealth of longitudinal clinical data, but also detailed information from modalities as varied as imaging, multiomics, and blood biomarkers. The profusion of big data has seen the proliferation of what we term \"modern data approaches\" (MDAs)-grouping together machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science-to make sense and make use of this data. In this review, we survey applications of MDAs (with an emphasis on machine learning) in childhood wheeze and asthma, highlighting the extent of their successes in providing tools for prognosis, unpicking the curricular heterogeneity of these conditions, clarifying the limitations of current diagnostic criteria, and indicating directions of research for uncovering the etiology of the diseases underlying these conditions. Specifically, we focus on the trajectories of childhood wheeze phenotypes. Further, we provide an explainer of the nature and potential use of MDAs and emphasize the scope of what we can hope to achieve with them.31492413<SEP>Etta D Pisano<SEP>Big Data and Radiology Research<SEP>Our understanding of human health may be significantly enhanced in the near future because of the unprecedented volume of digitized health care data and the availability of artificial intelligence to mine these data for correlations that could drive new research hypotheses and improved patient care. Observational studies and randomized trials are traditional methods to generate and test hypotheses. Another way to generate research hypotheses is to use big data to reveal patterns and associations for further study. In 2018, the National Institutes of Health unveiled its Strategic Plan for Data Science, which includes a far-reaching plan for the use of big data to stimulate new research discoveries. Both researchers and physicians will need to learn and apply new skills in understanding the use of artificial intelligence and other tools, as well as in the direct application of data collection and mining in their own practices and patients.38110652<SEP>Nestor A Molfino<SEP>Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Asthma Exacerbations: A Narrative Review<SEP>The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in healthcare has garnered significant attention in recent years, especially as a result of their potential to revolutionize personalized medicine. Despite advances in the treatment and management of asthma, a significant proportion of patients continue to suffer acute exacerbations, irrespective of disease severity and therapeutic regimen. The situation is further complicated by the constellation of factors that influence disease activity in a patient with asthma, such as medical history, biomarker phenotype, pulmonary function, level of healthcare access, treatment compliance, comorbidities, personal habits, and environmental conditions. A growing body of work has demonstrated the potential for AI and ML to accurately predict asthma exacerbations while also capturing the entirety of the patient experience. However, application in the clinical setting remains mostly unexplored, and important questions on the strengths and limitations of this technology remain. This review presents an overview of the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and ML integration into asthma management by providing a snapshot of the existing scientific evidence and proposing potential avenues for future applications.38065821<SEP>Florian Lemaitre<SEP>Can precision medicine be integrated into routine therapeutic decisions at the bedside of patients?<SEP>Therapeutic strategies are shifting from a \"one-size-fits-all\" population-based approach to a stratified approach targeting groups with similar characteristics, or even individuals, tailoring treatments to the unique characteristics of each patient. Since such strategies rely on increasingly complex knowledge and healthcare technologies, along with an understanding of the tools of precision medicine, the appropriate dissemination and use of these strategies involves a number of challenges for the medical community. Having evaluation methodologies that have been jointly designed with the institutional, industrial, academic stakeholders, and also patients, like streamlining the processes and externally validating performances, could enhance the relevance of the \"evaluation\" aspect of precision medicine. Creating a network of expert precision-medicine centers and ensuring that precision-medicine procedures are reimbursed by social security would guarantee fair and sustainable access. Finally, training healthcare professionals, creating interfaces between precision-medicine expert centers and primary care professionals as well as patients, and integrating individual patient data into medical records are all key drivers that will enable information from precision-medicine to be made available and guarantee the proper use of these approaches.",
    "answer": "Asthma attacks can be triggered by a variety of factors, many of which are environmental or related to personal health habits and conditions. Common triggers for asthma attacks include:\n\n1. **Allergens:** Such as pollen, animal dander, mold, and dust mites.\n2. **Respiratory infections:** Like the common cold or the flu.\n3. **Physical activity:** Exercise-induced asthma is a well-known phenomenon.\n4. **Cold air:** Can lead to bronchial tube constriction.\n5. **Air pollutants:** Including smoke, chemical fumes, and other irritants.\n6. **Stress and strong emotions:** Which can lead to hyperventilation and an asthma episode.\n7. **Certain medications:** For example, beta-blockers and aspirin can trigger asthma in some individuals.\n8. **Food additives:** Some preservatives and sulfites in foods and beverages might be triggers.\n9. **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD):** Can worsen asthma symptoms.\n\nThe context provided from the vector database underscores the growing interest in utilizing big data and machine learning (ML) to better understand and predict asthma exacerbations. Scholars like Darije Custovic are examining how modern data approaches can provide insights into the complex nature of asthma and other wheezing disorders, helping to stratify patients based on phenotypes and potential responses to specific treatments.\n\nEtta D Pisano discusses the role of big data in enhancing human health through revealing patterns that drive research and improve patient care. This can lead to more accurate identification of asthma triggers on a population basis, subsequently optimizing individual patient care.\n\nNestor A Molfino emphasizes that despite advances in asthma treatment, predicting exacerbations remains difficult due to the multitude of influencing factors. ML offers a way to integrate the broad spectrum of patient data\u2014encompassing everything from lifestyle to comorbidities\u2014in order to foresee and prevent attacks.\n\nFinally, Florian Lemaitre highlights the transition towards precision medicine, where treatments are tailored to individuals\u2019 unique characteristics. This targeted therapy and prevention approach could also apply to asthma management, with personalized plans developed to help avoid known triggers and manage symptoms more effectively.\n\nIn summary, common triggers for asthma attacks primarily involve allergens, infections, physical activity, and environmental factors. Contemporary research is exploring how fields such as big data and ML can inform more precise identification of triggers and pave the way for personalized asthma management strategies, thus potentially reducing the likelihood and severity of asthma attacks.",

    "question": "Which groups are susceptible to lung cancer?",
    "context": "33571312<SEP>Witness Mapanga<SEP>Consensus study on the health system and patient-related barriers for lung cancer management in South Africa<SEP>Background: Lung cancer is the highest incident cancer globally and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality particularly if identified at a late stage. Poor patient outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC's) might reflect contextual patient and health system constraints at multiple levels, that act as barriers to prevention, disease recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. Lung cancer screening, even for high-risk patients, is not available in the public health sector in South Africa (SA), where the current HIV and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics often take precedence. Yet, there has been no formal assessment of the individual and health-system related barriers that may delay patients with lung cancer from seeking and accessing help within the public health care system and receiving the appropriate and effective diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to derive consensus from health-system stakeholders in the urban Gauteng Province of SA on the most important challenges faced by the health services and patients in achieving optimum lung cancer management and to identify potential solutions. Methods: The study was undertaken among 27 participant stakeholders representing clinical managers, clinicians, opinion leaders from the public health sector and non-governmental organisation (NGO) representatives. The study compromised two components: consensus and engagement. For the consensus component, the Delphi Technique was employed with open-ended questions and item ranking from five rounds of consensus-seeking, to achieve collective agreement on the most important challenges faced by patients and the health services in achieving optimal lung cancer management. For the engagement component, the Nominal Group Technique was used to articulate ideas and reach an agreement on the group's recommendations for solution strategies and approaches. Results: Public health sector stakeholders suggested that a lack of knowledge and awareness of lung cancer, and the apparent stigma associated with the disease and its risk factors, as well as symptoms and signs, are critical to treatment delay. Furthermore, delays in up-referral of patients with suspected lung cancer from district health care level were attributed to inadequate knowledge arising from a lack of in-service training of nurses and doctors regarding oncologic symptoms, risk factors, need for further investigation, interpretation of x-rays and available treatments. At a tertiary level, participants suggested that insufficient availability of specialised diagnostic resources (imaging, cytological and pathological services including biomolecular assessment of lung cancer), theatres, cardiothoracic surgeons, and appropriate therapeutic modalities (chemotherapeutic agents and radiation oncology) are the main barriers to the provision of optimal care. It was suggested that a primary prevention programme initiated by the government that involves private-public partnerships may improve lung cancer management nationally. Conclusions: Considerable barriers to the early identification and treatment of lung cancer exist. Finding solutions to overcome both individual and health-system level obstacles to lung cancer screening and management are vital to facilitate early identification and treatment, and to improve survival. Furthermore, research on inexpensive biomarkers for asymptomatic disease detection, the introduction of diagnostic imaging tools that utilise artificial intelligence to compensate for inadequate human resources and improving clinical integration across all levels of the healthcare system are essential.36841473<SEP>Seamus O'Reilly<SEP>Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care in Ireland - Perspectives from a COVID-19 and Cancer Working Group<SEP>Upon the COVID-19 pandemic onset in Ireland, cancer service disruptions occurred due to prioritisation of COVID-19 related care, redeployment of staff, initial pausing of screening, diagnostic, medical and surgical oncology procedures, staff shortages due to COVID-19 infection and impacts on the physical and mental health of cancer healthcare workers. This was coupled with reluctance among people with symptoms suspicious for cancer to attend for clinical evaluation, due to concerns of contracting the virus. This was further compounded by a cyber-attack on national health service IT systems on May 14th 2021. The Irish Cancer Society, a national cancer charity with a role in advocacy, research and patient supports, convened a multi-disciplinary stakeholder group (COVID-19 and Cancer Working Group) to reflect on and understand the impact of the pandemic on cancer patients and services in Ireland, and discuss potential mitigation strategies. Perspectives on experiences were gathered across domains including timeliness of data acquisition and its conversion into intelligence, and the resourcing of cancer care to address cancer service impacts. The group highlighted aspects for future research to understand the long-term pandemic impact on cancer outcomes, while also highlighting potential strategies to support cancer services, build resilience and address delayed diagnosis. Additional measures include the need for cancer workforce recruitment and retention, increased mental health supports for both patients and oncology professionals, improvements to public health messaging, a near real-time multimodal national cancer database, and robust digital and physical infrastructure to mitigate impacts of the current pandemic and future challenges to cancer care systems.36617923<SEP>Chinese Thoracic Society<SEP>[Chinese expert consensus on diagnosis of early lung cancer (2023 Edition)]<SEP>Lung cancer is the leading cause of the incidence and mortality of malignant tumors in our country, seriously endangering people's lives and health. The treatment of lung cancer has made great progress in the past 10 years, and the 5-year survival rate of lung cancer in China has also increased from 16.1% to 19.7%, but about 75% of patients are still in advanced stages of lung cancer at the time of diagnosis, missing the best time for radical surgery. Early diagnosis can significantly improve the prognosis and survival of lung cancer patients. From the 5-year survival rate of lung cancer patients, it can be seen that the 5-year survival rate of stage \u2160 patients was 77%-92%, while that of stage \u2162A-\u2163A patients was only 10%-36%, and there was a significant difference in the 5-year survival rate. Studies have shown that early-diagnosed and completely resected lung adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) have 5-year disease-specific survival rates of 100% and 100%, respectively. Early diagnosis is the key to improving the prognosis of lung cancer. In order to further improve the level of early lung cancer diagnosis in China, especially the standardization in the diagnosis and evaluation of pulmonary nodules and early lung cancer, experts from the Lung Cancer Group of Chinese Thoracic Society formulated the \"Chinese Expert Consensus on Diagnosis of Early Lung Cancer (2023 Edition)\", on the basis of the actual situation in the field of diagnosis and treatment, with reference to the latest research data and relevant guidelines at home and abroad. Consensus on the application of artificial intelligence, big data and robotics, the Internet of Things and multidisciplinary cooperation in the diagnosis of early lung cancer, the management of pulmonary nodules and follow-up strategies for suspected early lung cancer, etc., were respectively recommended to provide references for clinicians in the diagnosis of early lung cancer, in order to further promote the early diagnosis of lung cancer in China.27683341<SEP>Harry E Cross<SEP>Government stewardship of the for-profit private health sector in Afghanistan<SEP>Background: Since 2003, Afghanistan's largely unregulated for-profit private health sector has grown at a rapid pace. In 2008, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) launched a long-term stewardship initiative to oversee and regulate private providers and align the sector with national health goals. Aim: We examine the progress the MoPH has made towards more effective stewardship, consider the challenges and assess the early impacts on for-profit performance. Methods: We reviewed publicly available documents, publications and the grey literature to analyse the development, adoption and implementation of strategies, policies and regulations. We carried out a series of key informant/participant interviews, organizational capacity assessments and analyses of hospital standards checklists. Using a literature review of health systems strengthening, we proposed an Afghan-specific definition of six key stewardship functions to assess progress towards MoPH stewardship objectives. Results: The MoPH and its partners have achieved positive results in strengthening its private sector stewardship functions especially in generating actionable intelligence and establishing strategic policy directions, administrative structures and a legal and regulatory framework. Progress has also been made on improving accountability and transparency, building partnerships and applying minimum required standards to private hospitals. Procedural and operational issues still need resolution and the MoPH is establishing mechanisms for resolving them. Conclusions: The MoPH stewardship initiative is notable for its achievements to date under challenging circumstances. Its success is due to the focus on developing a solid policy framework and building institutions and systems aimed at ensuring higher quality private services, and a rational long-term and sustainable role for the private sector. Although the MoPH stewardship initiative is still at an early stage, the evidence suggests that enhanced stewardship functions in the MoPH are leading to a more efficient and effective for-profit private sector. These successful early efforts offer high-leverage potential to rapidly scale up going forward.",
    "answer": "Taking into account the provided context from various sources, let's address the original question: \"Which groups are susceptible to lung cancer?\"\n\nLung cancer susceptibility can be understood from both a global and a specific national context such as South Africa, Ireland, China, and Afghanistan, as detailed in the context provided.\n\n1. **General Global Perspective**: \nGlobally, the groups that are generally at higher risk for lung cancer include:\n- Smokers: The primary risk factor for lung cancer is tobacco smoke, with the risk increasing with the amount of tobacco used and the time over which it's been used.\n- People exposed to secondhand smoke.\n- Individuals exposed to radon gas, asbestos, and other carcinogens through their occupation or environment.\n- Age group: Generally, older individuals are at higher risk, as the majority of people diagnosed with lung cancer are 65 or older.\n- Family history of lung cancer: There is a genetic component that can increase susceptibility to lung cancer.\n  \n2. **Specific Context from the Vector Database**:\nFrom the database entries, several additional factors affecting lung cancer susceptibility emerge:\n- **In South Africa (33571312)**: Lung cancer management faces significant barriers due to health system constraints. There is a lack of awareness and stigma associated with lung cancer among the population, and inadequate training among healthcare professionals. Therefore, individuals who lack access to knowledge and healthcare are more susceptible due to late diagnosis and treatment.\n- **In Ireland during COVID-19 (36841473)**: The pandemic has disrupted cancer care services, leading to service impacts and delayed diagnoses. Those reluctant to seek medical care due to fear of contracting the virus or because of disruptions in healthcare services are at increased risk of being diagnosed at a later, less treatable stage of lung cancer.\n- **In China (36617923)**: There is an emphasis on the importance of early diagnosis for improved lung cancer survival rates. About 75% of patients are diagnosed at advanced stages. Early detection and the availability of medical technology, such as AI and big data, are critical. This suggests that populations with limited access to advanced diagnostic tools are more susceptible to late-stage lung cancer discovery.\n- **In Afghanistan\u2019s for-profit health sector (27683341)**: Due to rapid growth and previous lack of regulation in the private health sector, access to quality healthcare and information on lung health could be a concern. Populations that rely on the private sector, which might not align with national health goals, may face increased vulnerability regarding timely lung cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIn conclusion, susceptibility to lung cancer is influenced by a variety of factors, including personal habits, environmental exposures, socioeconomic factors, healthcare system barriers, and the impact of pandemic-related service disruptions. Addressing the barriers at both individual and health-system levels is crucial for the early identification and effective management of lung cancer to improve outcomes.",

    "context": "26435836<SEP>Andrea Phillipou<SEP>Are personality disturbances in anorexia nervosa related to emotion processing or eating disorder symptomatology?<SEP>Background: Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric illness associated with a number of personality disturbances. However, whether these personality characteristics are related to eating disorder symptomatology or emotion regulation is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate these relationships. Results: Twenty-four individuals with AN and 25 age- and premorbid intelligence-matched controls completed the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire, and scores were correlated with measures of emotionality and negative mood states, and eating disorder symptomatology. AN was associated with increased scores on schizoid, borderline, avoidant, dependent, obsessive compulsive, negativistic and depressive personality dimensions, relative to controls. In AN, eating disorder symptomatology did not significantly correlate with scores on any personality dimension. However, a number of personality characteristics were found to correlate with negative mood states. Conclusions: The findings suggest that personality disturbances in AN are not related to disorder-specific symptoms, but are related to negative mood states.32767255<SEP>J Cholet<SEP>Evaluation of cognitive impairment in a French sample of patients with restrictive anorexia nervosa: two distinct profiles emerged with differences in impaired functions and psychopathological symptoms<SEP>Purpose: The cognitive profiles of patients suffering from anorexia nervosa (AN) are currently explored as potential facilitating and/or maintenance factors. Specific data in restrictive AN (AN-R) remain contradictory. This study focused on women with AN-R to evaluate their cognitive functions to develop a more specific cognitive remediation program. Methods: Female patients older than 15 years who were suffering from AN-R were recruited in a specialized unit for eating disorder management. Female healthy control (HC) participants were recruited who were matched with AN patients on age. All participants completed a cognitive evaluation (premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ), planning, information processing speed, cognitive flexibility) and a clinical evaluation (impulsivity, anxiety, depression). Results: A total of 122 participants were included. Patients suffering from AN-R had significant impairment in information processing speed and planning. Patients exhibited significantly better cognitive flexibility than did the HC group when adjustments were made for other cognitive functions and impulsivity. Two distinct subgroups of patients were identified. The first subgroup had more marked cognitive impairment and fewer psychopathological symptoms than did the second subgroup of patients and the HC group. Conclusion: Our results highlight cognitive impairment in patients with AN who had normal premorbid IQ. Two distinct profiles emerge. In clinical practice, these results open up perspectives for the development of more specific cognitive remediation programs (one specific program for cold cognitions and another specific program targeting emotions and hot cognitions). These results warrant confirmation by larger studies with a more specific evaluation of the impact of emotional status. Trial registration NTC02381639, Date of registration. March 6, 2015.24750960<SEP>Ronald J Gurrera<SEP>Cognitive task performance and symptoms contribute to personality abnormalities in first hospitalized schizophrenia<SEP>Chronic schizophrenia patients have personality abnormalities and cognitive deficits that are associated with poor clinical, social, and vocational outcomes. Very few studies have examined relationships between personality and cognitive function, and chronic illness effects may have confounded those studies. In this study personality traits in clinically stable first episode schizophrenia patients (21M, 9F) and psychiatrically healthy controls (38M, 24F) were measured with the NEO-FFI, a self-report measure of neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. All subjects completed the Information, Digit Span, Vocabulary, and Digit Symbol subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale; and Trails A and B. Standard statistical techniques were used to quantify relationships between personality and symptom levels and/or task performance, and relative contributions of diagnosis and task performance to personality variance. Patients showed elevated mean neuroticism and openness, and reduced mean extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness. Task performance and negative symptoms contributed significantly and uniquely to most personality dimensions in patients. Task performance accounted for significant amounts of personality variance even after accounting for diagnosis, and it also contributed to personality variance in controls. These results suggest that cognitive deficits and negative symptoms contribute to consistently observed personality abnormalities in this disorder, and that the contribution of neuropsychological performance to personality variance may be independent of diagnostic classification. Personality abnormalities in schizophrenia may stem from the neurocognitive deficits associated with this disorder, and add to their adverse effects on social and vocational functioning.23021014<SEP>R Kothari<SEP>The neuropsychological profile of children at high risk of developing an eating disorder<SEP>Background: There is a large body of evidence indicating that eating disorders (EDs) are characterized by particular neuropsychological profiles. We aimed to further explore whether impairments in neuropsychological functioning previously found in ED groups are present prior to onset, or are secondary to the disorder. Method This is the first study to explore neuropsychological functioning in children born to a mother with a lifetime ED, who are therefore at high risk of developing an ED, in a large cohort sample. We investigated intelligence and attention at age 8 years (n = 6201) and working memory (WM) and inhibition at age 10 years (6192) in children who are at high risk of developing an ED, compared to children who are not. Results: The children of women with lifetime anorexia nervosa (AN) showed high full-scale and performance IQ, increased WM capacity, better visuo-spatial functioning, and decreased attentional control. The children of women with lifetime bulimia nervosa (BN) showed comparatively poor visuo-spatial functioning. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that high intelligence, increased WM capacity and impaired attentional control might be intermediate phenotypes on the pathway between genetic vulnerability and the development of an ED.",
    "answer": "There are several well-characterized types of eating disorders, which are complex mental health conditions that can have serious physical and emotional consequences. The main types include:\n\n1. **Anorexia Nervosa (AN):** Characterized by a pattern of restricting food intake which leads to significant weight loss or a lack of appropriate weight gain, intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted body image. The context provided from the vector database discusses AN's association with personality disturbances, cognitive impairments, and potentially being an intermediate phenotype related to higher intelligence and working memory capacity.\n\n2. **Bulimia Nervosa (BN):** Involves episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors like purging, fasting, or excessive exercise. People with BN may have a fear of weight gain, but unlike AN, they typically maintain a weight that is within or above the normal range. The context mentions that children of women with a lifetime diagnosis of BN showed comparatively poor visuo-spatial functioning, suggesting a potential cognitive phenotype associated with BN.\n\n3. **Binge Eating Disorder (BED):** Similar to BN, BED includes episodes of binge eating but without the regular use of compensatory behaviors, leading to feelings of distress, guilt, and embarrassment. BED often leads to overweight or obesity.\n\n4. **Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID):** Unlike AN, individuals with ARFID avoid or restrict food intake without concerns about body weight or shape. This may be due to lack of interest in eating, sensory characteristics of food, or past negative experiences with food.\n\n5. **Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED):** This category includes atypical or subthreshold conditions that cause significant distress or impairment but do not meet the full criteria for the above disorders.\n\n6. **Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder (UFED):** This is a category used when an individual's symptoms cause clinical distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning but do not meet the full criteria of any of the feeding or eating disorders.\n\nThe context provided from the vector database helps frame these disorders in relation to cognitive functioning and personality traits. For example, the presence of personality disturbances and cognitive impairments in AN suggests that these factors might not directly correlate with eating disorder symptomatology but rather with negative mood states or other underlying cognitive aspects.\n\nFurthermore, it is noted that children of mothers with a lifetime diagnosis of an eating disorder might present with certain cognitive features that could act as intermediate phenotypes predisposing them to the development of eating disorders. This suggests that both genetic vulnerability and certain neuropsychological profiles may contribute to the risk of developing eating disorders like AN and BN.",

    "question": "What lifestyle modifications assist in managing hypertension?",
    "context": "33978593<SEP>Kobra Etminani<SEP>Improving Medication Adherence Through Adaptive Digital Interventions (iMedA) in Patients With Hypertension: Protocol for an Interrupted Time Series Study<SEP>Background: There is a strong need to improve medication adherence (MA) for individuals with hypertension in order to reduce long-term hospitalization costs. We believe this can be achieved through an artificial intelligence agent that helps the patient in understanding key individual adherence risk factors and designing an appropriate intervention plan. The incidence of hypertension in Sweden is estimated at approximately 27%. Although blood pressure control has increased in Sweden, barely half of the treated patients achieved adequate blood pressure levels. It is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke as well as heart failure. MA is a key factor for good clinical outcomes in persons with hypertension. Objective: The overall aim of this study is to design, develop, test, and evaluate an adaptive digital intervention called iMedA, delivered via a mobile app to improve MA, self-care management, and blood pressure control for persons with hypertension. Methods: The study design is an interrupted time series. We will collect data on a daily basis, 14 days before, during 6 months of delivering digital interventions through the mobile app, and 14 days after. The effect will be analyzed using segmented regression analysis. The participants will be recruited in Region Halland, Sweden. The design of the digital interventions follows the just-in-time adaptive intervention framework. The primary (distal) outcome is MA, and the secondary outcome is blood pressure. The design of the digital intervention is developed based on a needs assessment process including a systematic review, focus group interviews, and a pilot study, before conducting the longitudinal interrupted time series study. Results: The focus groups of persons with hypertension have been conducted to perform the needs assessment in a Swedish context. The design and development of digital interventions are in progress, and the interventions are planned to be ready in November 2020. Then, the 2-week pilot study for usability evaluation will start, and the interrupted time series study, which we plan to start in February 2021, will follow it. Conclusions: We hypothesize that iMedA will improve medication adherence and self-care management. This study could illustrate how self-care management tools can be an additional (digital) treatment support to a clinical one without increasing burden on health care staff.

International registered report identifier (irrid): DERR1-10.2196/24494.33974148<SEP>Merel Huisman<SEP>An international survey on AI in radiology in 1041 radiologists and radiology residents part 2: expectations, hurdles to implementation, and education<SEP>Objectives: Currently, hurdles to implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology are a much-debated topic but have not been investigated in the community at large. Also, controversy exists if and to what extent AI should be incorporated into radiology residency programs. Methods: Between April and July 2019, an international survey took place on AI regarding its impact on the profession and training. The survey was accessible for radiologists and residents and distributed through several radiological societies. Relationships of independent variables with opinions, hurdles, and education were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: The survey was completed by 1041 respondents from 54 countries. A majority (n = 855, 82%) expects that AI will cause a change to the radiology field within 10 years. Most frequently, expected roles of AI in clinical practice were second reader (n = 829, 78%) and work-flow optimization (n = 802, 77%). Ethical and legal issues (n = 630, 62%) and lack of knowledge (n = 584, 57%) were mentioned most often as hurdles to implementation. Expert respondents added lack of labelled images and generalizability issues. A majority (n = 819, 79%) indicated that AI should be incorporated in residency programs, while less support for imaging informatics and AI as a subspecialty was found (n = 241, 23%). Conclusions: Broad community demand exists for incorporation of AI into residency programs. Based on the results of the current study, integration of AI education seems advisable for radiology residents, including issues related to data management, ethics, and legislation. Key points: \u2022 There is broad demand from the radiological community to incorporate AI into residency programs, but there is less support to recognize imaging informatics as a radiological subspecialty. \u2022 Ethical and legal issues and lack of knowledge are recognized as major bottlenecks for AI implementation by the radiological community, while the shortage in labeled data and IT-infrastructure issues are less often recognized as hurdles. \u2022 Integrating AI education in radiology curricula including technical aspects of data management, risk of bias, and ethical and legal issues may aid successful integration of AI into diagnostic radiology.32026453<SEP>Cheng-Yang Hsieh<SEP>Medication Adherence and Stroke Prevention: What Real World Data Tells Us<SEP>Medication adherence, by definition,(2) is \"the extent to which a patient acts in accordance with the prescribed interval and dose of a dosing regimen.\" Poor medication adherence can interfere with the ability to treat many diseases, leading to greater complications and a lower quality of life.(3) In this issue of Acta Neurologica Taiwanica, Chen et al.(4) presented the inverse association between adherence of antithrombotic agents and poor outcomes after a first-ever ischemic stroke. The findings were consistent with Sung, et al.(5) that medication nonadherence are prevalent in young adults with a firstever stroke. The results by Chen, et al.(4) highlighted the importance of developing strategies to improve antithrombotic adherence. Besides, the risk-benefit profile of medication treatment must be considered and monitored for optimizing prescription in secondary stroke prevention. For those purposes, real-world data (RWD) derived from administrative claims database is becoming an efficient source of information.(6) The US Food and Drug Administration has also recognized the use of RWD to monitor post-marketing safety and adverse events and to make regulatory decisions of medicinal products.(7) Nonetheless, deriving RWD from administrative claims database should be held to an even higher scientific standard because of the greater potential for bias.(6) For example, the ascertainment of cases, coding for comorbidities, and handling of unmeasured confounders (e.g. disease severity) should follow those previously wellvalidated methods.(8-10) Besides, we should note that the adherence measured using claims data is the proportion of days covered with filled prescription. It might not be exactly equal to the real medication adherence behavior of the patients, as mentioned by Chen, et al.(4) Linking administrative claims database with other validated clinical databases (e.g. stroke registry) may improve the validity of a RWD study.(11) In the era of data science and artificial intelligence, we neurologists should endeavor to make the best use of all available electronic healthcare datasets, creating more useful RWD for our patients with strokes, as well as other neurological diseases.36877564<SEP>Naomi Waithira<SEP>Investigating the Secondary Use of Clinical Research Data: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study<SEP>Background: The increasing emphasis to share patient data from clinical research has resulted in substantial investments in data repositories and infrastructure. However, it is unclear how shared data are used and whether anticipated benefits are being realized. Objective: The purpose of our study is to examine the current utilization of shared clinical research data sets and assess the effects on both scientific research and public health outcomes. Additionally, the study seeks to identify the factors that hinder or facilitate the ethical and efficient use of existing data based on the perspectives of data users. Methods: The study will utilize a mixed methods design, incorporating a cross-sectional survey and in-depth interviews. The survey will involve at least 400 clinical researchers, while the in-depth interviews will include 20 to 40 participants who have utilized data from repositories or institutional data access committees. The survey will target a global sample, while the in-depth interviews will focus on individuals who have used data collected from low- and middle-income countries. Quantitative data will be summarized by using descriptive statistics, while multivariable analyses will be used to assess the relationships between variables. Qualitative data will be analyzed through thematic analysis, and the findings will be reported in accordance with the COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research) guidelines. The study received ethical approval from the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee in 2020 (reference number: 568-20). Results: The results of the analysis, including both quantitative data and qualitative data, will be available in 2023. Conclusions: The outcomes of our study will offer crucial understanding into the current status of data reuse in clinical research, serving as a basis for guiding future endeavors to enhance the utilization of shared data for the betterment of public health outcomes and for scientific progress.

    "answer": "### Answer Generated:\n\nLifestyle modifications play a fundamental role in managing hypertension, which in turn can significantly reduce medication adherence (MA) demands and the long-term risks associated with high blood pressure, such as coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure. Considering the context provided about medication adherence, digital interventions, and the significance of managing hypertension, the following lifestyle changes are critical:\n\n1. **Dietary Adjustments**: Reducing salt intake can help in controlling high blood pressure. The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is often recommended, which emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods.\n\n2. **Weight Management**: Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is vital, as excess weight can put additional strain on the heart.\n\n3. **Regular Physical Activity**: Engaging in regular exercise such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming can lower blood pressure and improve heart health.\n\n4. **Limitation of Alcohol Consumption**: Excessive drinking can raise blood pressure levels, so moderation is key.\n\n5. **Tobacco Cessation**: Smoking and tobacco use can damage blood vessels and raise blood pressure. Quitting tobacco can improve heart health and overall well-being.\n\n6. **Stress Reduction**: Chronic stress is a contributor to hypertension. Mindfulness, meditation, and relaxation techniques can mitigate stress levels.\n\n7. **Monitoring Blood Pressure at Home**: Keeping track of blood pressure readings at home can help in managing hypertension effectively.\n\n8. **Medication Adherence**: While not a lifestyle modification, adhering to prescribed medications is essential for controlling blood pressure.\n\nFrom the perspective of digital interventions, tools like the iMedA mobile app can support these lifestyle modifications by providing tailored advice, reminders for medication, and monitoring of health indicators, thus contributing to improved self-care management. Such digital interventions could also be part of education and training in various fields, including radiology as mentioned in the context, where AI is increasingly becoming an important tool.\n\nFurthermore, real-world data shows the importance of medication adherence in preventing complications like stroke. As such, lifestyle interventions could reduce the burden of medication nonadherence and its associated risks.\n\nIn conclusion, lifestyle modifications, empowered by digital interventions and supported by medical adherence, are a potent combination for managing hypertension, leading to healthier outcomes and potentially reducing healthcare costs and burdens.",

    "context": "26703116<SEP>F Langlands<SEP>Contralateral breast cancer: incidence according to ductal or lobular phenotype of the primary<SEP>Aim: To identify differences in the incidence of contralateral breast cancer between patients with a primary tumour diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and those with a diagnosis of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Materials and methods: Data from two large cancer registries (registry A & B) the Northern and Yorkshire Cancer Registry Information Service (NYCRIS) and the West Midlands Cancer Intelligence Unit (WMCIU) from 1998-2003 for all cases of invasive breast cancer of either pure ductal or pure lobular reported histology were obtained. The invasive status of the contralateral tumour diagnosis and tumour morphology was collected. Chi-square tests were undertaken to examine the differences in contralateral rates for both registries and univariate analysis to ascertain which predictors affected contralateral breast cancer risk for registry A the WMCIU cases. Results: A total of 38,132 patients were studied, 32,735 patients with IDC and 5397 (14.2%) patients with ILC over the 6-year period. There was no significant difference between the occurrence and time to occurrence of contralateral breast cancer according to original cancer histology, 901 (2.8%) patients with IDC versus 166 (3.1%) patients with ILC (p=0.169). The analysis of registry A cases showed no association between original histology (ductal versus lobular), age at diagnosis, tumour grade, use of radiotherapy for the primary cancer or use of systemic therapy (chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy), and development of a contralateral breast cancer. Conclusion: There is no apparent increase in risk of developing a contralateral breast cancer according to the primary cancer histology either IDC or ILC. Standard mammographic follow-up does not need to take account of original tumour pathology. Increased intervention or post-treatment surveillance for the contralateral breast is not indicated in the context of ILC. The role of MRI should be restricted to those patients with ILC who are planning breast-conservation surgery, but not for assessing the contralateral breast.37642571<SEP>Andreas D Lauritzen<SEP>Assessing Breast Cancer Risk by Combining AI for Lesion Detection and Mammographic Texture<SEP>Background Recent mammography-based risk models can estimate short-term or long-term breast cancer risk, but whether risk assessment may improve by combining these models has not been evaluated. Purpose To determine whether breast cancer risk assessment improves when combining a diagnostic artificial intelligence (AI) system for lesion detection and a mammographic texture model. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included Danish women consecutively screened for breast cancer at mammography from November 2012 to December 2015 who had at least 5 years of follow-up data. Examinations were evaluated for short-term risk using a commercially available diagnostic AI system for lesion detection, which produced a score to indicate the probability of cancer. A mammographic texture model, trained on a separate data set, assessed textures associated with long-term cancer risk. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis was used to evaluate both the individual and combined performance of the AI and texture models for the prediction of future cancers in women with a negative screening mammogram, including those with interval cancers diagnosed within 2 years of screening and long-term cancers diagnosed 2 years or more after screening. AUCs were compared using the DeLong test. Results The Danish screening cohort included 119 650 women (median age, 59 years [IQR, 53-64 years]), of whom 320 developed interval cancers and 1401 developed long-term cancers. The combination model achieved a higher AUC for interval and long-term cancers grouped together than either the diagnostic AI (AUC, 0.73 vs 0.70; P < .001) or the texture risk (AUC, 0.73 vs 0.66; P < .001) models. The 10% of women with the highest combined risk identified by the combination model accounted for 44.1% (141 of 320) of interval cancers and 33.7% (472 of 1401) of long-term cancers. Conclusion Combining a diagnostic AI system and mammographic texture model resulted in improved risk assessment for interval cancers and long-term cancers and enabled identification of women at high risk. \u00a9 RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

In 2012, approximately 522,000 women died of breast cancer across the world. The aim of this study is to provide an up-to-date analysis of time trends in incidence, geographical distribution, survival and mortality from breast cancer in Wales. Methods: Breast cancer cases registered between 1985 and 2012 were identified from the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit (WCISU). A Poisson regression model was fitted to assess temporal trends and rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined and compared in relation to age, geographical distribution and mortality across time periods. Results: A total of 60,227 women diagnosed with breast cancer were registered with the Welsh cancer registry between 1985 and 2012. The age-standardised incidence rate of breast cancer was 113.4 per 100,000 populations over the entire study period. There has been a significant increase in the incidence of breast cancer over the study period, although a slight decline was recorded towards the end of the study. There is a considerable regional variation in incidence, with a higher incidence rate in the rural areas compared to urban areas (P<0.001). One- and five-year relative survival improved from 83.3 and 64.2 respectively in 1985-1989 to 91.1 and 78.8 respectively in 2000-2004. There has also been a considerable improvement in relative survival across all age groups. Mortality has improved over the study period with the most dramatic decline in the age groups 45-54 and 55-64 years (P<0.001). Conclusions: There has been a significant increase in the incidence of breast cancer in Wales over the last three decades, which is likely to be partly due to the introduction of the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme. Breast cancer incidence is higher in rural areas than urban areas and lower incidence was seen in more deprived areas. There was a considerable decline in mortality rate across almost all age groups, especially in recent years. However, women over the age of 65 years had poorer outcome throughout the study period.37183076<SEP>M\u00e9lanie Champendal<SEP>Artificial intelligence to support person-centred care in breast imaging - A scoping review<SEP>Aim: To overview Artificial Intelligence (AI) developments and applications in breast imaging (BI) focused on providing person-centred care in diagnosis and treatment for breast pathologies. Methods: The scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. The search was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of science, IEEE explore and arxiv during July 2022 and included only studies published after 2016, in French and English. Combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings terms (MeSH) related to breast imaging and AI were used. No keywords or MeSH terms related to patients, or the person-centred care (PCC) concept were included. Three independent reviewers screened all abstracts and titles, and all eligible full-text publications during a second stage. Results: 3417 results were identified by the search and 106 studies were included for meeting all criteria. Six themes relating to the AI-enabled PCC in BI were identified: individualised risk prediction/growth and prediction/false negative reduction (44.3%), treatment assessment (32.1%), tumour type prediction (11.3%), unnecessary biopsies reduction (5.7%), patients' preferences (2.8%) and other issues (3.8%). The main BI modalities explored in the included studies were magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (31.1%), mammography (27.4%) and ultrasound (23.6%). The studies were predominantly retrospective, and some variations (age range, data source, race, medical imaging) were present in the datasets used. Conclusions: The AI tools for person-centred care are mainly designed for risk and cancer prediction and disease management to identify the most suitable treatment. However, further studies are needed for image acquisition optimisation for different patient groups, improvement and customisation of patient experience and for communicating to patients the options and pathways of disease management.",
    "answer": "The user's original question pertains to the most prevalent types of cancer affecting both genders. While the context provided does not directly answer this question, it contains valuable information centered around breast cancer research, one of the common cancers affecting women. Additionally, there's an emphasis on various approaches for analyzing, predicting, and managing breast cancer through traditional and AI-enhanced methods. However, information about cancer prevalence in males or other types of cancer affecting both genders is lacking in the context provided.\n\nFrom the context, we can infer several points related to breast cancer:\n\n1. **Incidence and Contralateral Breast Cancer**: The study by F Langlands looked at the incidence of contralateral breast cancer in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). The conclusion was that primary cancer histology does not significantly increase the risk of developing contralateral breast cancer, therefore not necessitating more intensive intervention or surveillance for the contralateral breast based on primary tumor pathology.\n\n2. **AI and Mammographic Texture in Risk Assessment**: Andreas D Lauritzen's research demonstrated that combining AI for lesion detection with a mammographic texture model improves risk assessment for both interval and long-term breast cancers. The combination model also aids in identifying women at a higher risk with more accuracy.\n\n3. **Epidemiology in Wales**: Ganiy Opeyemi Abdulrahman Jnr's study analyzed time trends, geography, survival, and mortality for breast cancer in Wales, indicating a significant increase in breast cancer incidence rates over time. There was also a higher rate of incidence in rural areas compared to urban areas. Survival rates improved while mortality rates declined over the study period.\n\n4. **AI in Breast Imaging**: M\u00e9lanie Champendal reviewed AI applications in breast imaging, focusing on person-centered care. The study found that AI in breast imaging is mainly aimed at risk prediction and treatment management with the potential for improvement in patient communication and optimization of image acquisition for diverse patient groups.\n\nConsidering the contextual information, a more complete answer to the original question would require data from a comprehensive source that catalogs cancer prevalence overall. Nevertheless, to give a broad answer to the original question based on general knowledge:\nPrevalent cancer types in women often include breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. In men, the most common cancer types typically include prostate cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Notably, lung and colorectal cancers affect both genders significantly. The prevalence rates can vary from one region to another and are influenced by numerous factors including genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that while the provided context focuses on innovative research in breast cancer, cancer prevalence encompasses a wide range of factors and cancer types not covered within the given documents. Comprehensive global and regional cancer statistics, demographic information, and lifestyle factors are essential to fully answer the question about prevalent cancer types in both genders.",

    "context": "24365456<SEP>V A Morgan<SEP>Psychosis prevalence and physical, metabolic and cognitive co-morbidity: data from the second Australian national survey of psychosis<SEP>Background: There are insufficient data from nationwide surveys on the prevalence of specific psychotic disorders and associated co-morbidities. Method: The 2010 Australian national psychosis survey used a two-phase design to draw a representative sample of adults aged 18-64 years with psychotic disorders in contact with public treatment services from an estimated resident population of 1 464 923 adults. This paper is based on data from 1642 participants with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 psychotic disorder. Its aim is to present estimates of treated prevalence and lifetime morbid risk of psychosis, and to describe the cognitive, physical health and substance use profiles of participants. Results: The 1-month treated prevalence of psychotic disorders was 3.10 cases per 1000 population aged 18-64 years, not accounting for people solely accessing primary care services; lifetime morbid risk was 3.45 per 1000. Mean premorbid intelligence quotient was approximately 0.5 s.d.s below the population mean; current cognitive ability (measured with a digit symbol coding task) was 1.6 s.d.s below the population mean. For both cognitive tests, higher scores were significantly associated with better independent functioning. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was high, affecting 60.8% of participants, and pervasive across diagnostic groups. Of the participants, two-thirds (65.9%) were current smokers, 47.4% were obese and 32.4% were sedentary. Of the participants, half (49.8%) had a lifetime history of alcohol abuse/dependence and 50.8% lifetime cannabis abuse/dependence. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive, integrative models of recovery to maximize the potential for good health and quality of life for people with psychotic illness.34094888<SEP>Daniel Mamah<SEP>Neurocognition in Kenyan youth at clinical high risk for psychosis<SEP>Introduction: Cognitive deficits are typically seen in schizophrenia and in the prodrome, and are a major predictor of functional outcomes in patients. In Africa, few studies have investigated neurocognition in psychosis, which presents a gap in our understanding of the heterogeneity of the illness. In this study, we assessed neurocognition among the largest sample of psychosis-risk participants recruited in the continent to date. Methods: The study was conducted in Kenya, and involved 295 psychiatric medication-na\u00efve participants at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis and healthy controls, aged 15-25 yrs. Psychosis-risk status was determined separately using the Structured Interview of Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (i.e. CHR) and by self-report with the Washington Early Recognition Center Affectivity and Psychosis Screen. Eleven tests were administered using the University of Pennsylvania Computerized Neurocognitive Battery. Test performance across groups were investigated, as well as demographic and clinical effects. Results: Fewer participants were designated as being at psychosis-risk with structured interview (n = 47; CHR) than with self-report (n = 155). A MANOVA of cognitive test performance was significant only when groups were ascertained based on self-report (p = 0.03), with decreased performance in the risk group on verbal intelligence (p = 0.003; d = 0.39), emotion recognition (p = 0.003; d = 0.36), sensorimotor processing (p = 0.01; d = 0.31) and verbal memory (p = 0.035; d = 0.21). Only verbal intelligence was significantly worse in the CHR group compared to controls (p = 0.036; d = 0.45). There were no significant age and gender relationships. Conclusion: Deficits across multiple cognitive domains are present in Kenyan psychosis-risk youth, most significantly in verbal intelligence. The pattern of cognitive deficits and an absence of gender effects may represent ethnicity-specific phenotypes of the psychosis-risk state. Longitudinal studies of neurocognition in Kenyan patients who convert to psychosis may enhance risk prediction in this population, and facilitate targeted interventions.23443820<SEP>Natalie M Michel<SEP>WAIS-IV profile of cognition in schizophrenia<SEP>The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) has been used extensively to study impairment across a range of cognitive domains in schizophrenia. However, cognitive performance among those with the illness has yet to be examined using the newest edition of this measure. Hence, the current study aims first, to provide WAIS-IV normative data for Canadian individuals with schizophrenia of low average intelligence; second, to examine schizophrenia performance on all WAIS-IV subtest, index and general intelligence scores relative to healthy comparison subjects; and third, to revalidate the pattern of impairment identified in this clinical group using the WAIS-III, where processing speed (PS) was most affected, followed by working memory (WM), perceptual reasoning (PR) and verbal comprehension (VC). The WAIS-IV was administered to outpatients with schizophrenia and their performance compared with age, gender, and education matched controls. WAIS-IV schizophrenia performance data are provided. Analyses revealed significant impairment on several tasks, including the new Cancellation subtest and the VC supplemental subtest, Comprehension. At the index score level, group differences in PS were significantly larger than those observed in all other cognitive domains. Impairments were also observed in WM amid relatively preserved performance in VC, thereby confirming the pattern of impairment identified using the WAIS-III.28436345<SEP>J van Os<SEP>Evidence that polygenic risk for psychotic disorder is expressed in the domain of neurodevelopment, emotion regulation and attribution of salience<SEP>Background: The liability-threshold model of psychosis risk predicts stronger phenotypic manifestation of the polygenic risk score (PRS) in the healthy relatives of patients, as compared with healthy comparison subjects. Methods: First-degree relatives of patients with psychotic disorder (871 siblings and 812 parents) and healthy comparison subjects (n = 523) were interviewed three times in 6 years. Repeated measures of two psychosis phenotypes, the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE; self-report - subscales of positive, negative and depressive symptoms) and the Structured Interview for Schizotypy - Revised (SIS-R; clinical interview - subscales of positive and negative schizotypy), were examined for association with PRS. Interview-based lifetime rate of depressive and manic episodes were also examined, as was association with repeated measures of intelligence quotient (IQ). Results: In the relatives, PRS was associated with CAPE/SIS-R total score (respectively, B = 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.22 and B = 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.20), the SIS-R positive subscale (B = 0.16, 95% CI 0.04-0.28), the CAPE depression subscale (B = 0.21, 95% CI 0.07-0.34), any lifetime affective episode (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.04-9.3), but not with IQ (B = -1.8, 95% CI -8.0 to 4.4). In the controls, similar associations were apparent between PRS on the one hand and SIS-R total score, SIS-R positive, SIS-R negative, any lifetime affective episode and, in contrast, lower IQ (B = -8.5, 95% CI -15.5 to -1.6). Conclusions: In non-ill people, polygenic risk for psychotic disorder is expressed pleiotropically in the domain of neurodevelopment, emotion regulation and attribution of salience. In subjects at elevated genetic risk, emerging expression of neurodevelopmental alterations may create floor effects, obscuring genetic associations.",
    "answer": "Based on the context provided from the vector database, we can understand that mental health disorder types, specifically psychotic disorders, have diverse manifestations and are associated with a range of co-morbidities and cognitive deficits. Psychotic disorders are severe mental health conditions characterized by an impaired sense of reality, and they can present differently across various types of psychotic disorders as identified by the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10.\n\nWhen discussing diverse mental health disorder types, we should consider the following categories:\n\n1. **Psychotic Disorders**: These include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and delusional disorder, among others. The context highlights cognitive impairments, particularly in processing speed and working memory, as common features among patients with schizophrenia.\n\n2. **Mood Disorders**: This group includes illnesses like major depression and bipolar disorder. Mood disorders can sometimes present with psychotic features and are associated with polygenic risk factors.\n\n3. **Anxiety Disorders**: These are characterized by excessive fear or anxiety, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and phobias.\n\n4. **Personality Disorders**: These are enduring patterns of inner experience and behavior that deviate markedly from the expectations of the individual\u2019s culture. They include disorders such as borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder.\n\n5. **Substance-Related Disorders**: These encompass disorders related to the abuse of substances like alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and others, which can cause cognitive deficits and other health issues.\n\n6. **Eating Disorders**: Conditions like anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder are included in this category, often associated with psychological and physiological complications.\n\n7. **Neurodevelopmental Disorders**: Such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), these often emerge in childhood and are related to the development of the nervous system.\n\n8. **Neurocognitive Disorders**: This category includes disorders that primarily affect cognitive abilities, such as dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, and are characterized by intellectual decline from a previously higher level of functioning.\n\nThe context from the Australian national survey of psychosis emphasizes that cognitive deficits are significant in psychotic disorders, with impaired intelligence quotient (IQ) and other cognitive abilities. Additionally, there are high rates of co-morbid physical health issues, such as metabolic syndrome, and substance use disorders. The study from Kenya also discusses cognitive deficits in youth at clinical high risk for psychosis, indicating early identification and intervention as a crucial step. The data on Canadian individuals with schizophrenia using the WAIS-IV underscores specific impairments in processing speed and working memory. Lastly, the research on polygenic risk factors suggests that genetic predispositions for psychotic disorders can manifest in various ways, including neurodevelopment and emotion regulation difficulties.\n\nIn conclusion, mental health disorders, including psychotic disorders, display heterogeneity in their types, cognitive profiles, and associated risks and co-morbidities. Understanding the full breadth of these disorders requires consideration of biological, psychological, and social factors.",

    "question": "Which antibiotics are commonly prescribed for bacterial infections?",
    "context": "36276648<SEP>Devika Mukherjee<SEP>Addressing antimicrobial resistance with the IDentif.AI platform: Rapidly optimizing clinically actionable combination therapy regimens against nontuberculous mycobacteria<SEP>Background: Current standard of care (SOC) regimens against nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) usually result in unsatisfactory therapeutic responses, primarily due to multi-drug resistance and antibiotic susceptibility-guided therapies. In the midst of rising incidences in NTM infections, strategies to develop NTM-specific treatments have been explored and validated. Methods: To provide an alternative approach to address NTM-specific treatment, IDentif.AI was harnessed to rapidly optimize and design effective combination therapy regimens against Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus), the highly resistant and rapid growth species of NTM. IDentif.AI interrogated the drug interaction space from a pool of 6 antibiotics, and pinpointed multiple clinically actionable drug combinations. IDentif.AI-pinpointed actionable combinations were experimentally validated and their interactions were assessed using Bliss independence model and diagonal measurement of n-way drug interactions. Results: Notably, IDentfi.AI-designed 3- and 4-drug combinations demonstrated greater %Inhibition efficacy than the SOC regimens. The platform also pinpointed two unique drug interactions (Levofloxacin (LVX)/Rifabutin (RFB) and LVX/Meropenem (MEM)) that may serve as the backbone of potential 3- and 4-drug combinations like LVX/MEM/RFB, which exhibited 58.33\u00b14.99 %Inhibition efficacy against M. abscessus. Further analysis of LVX/RFB via Bliss independence model pointed to dose-dependent synergistic interactions in clinically actionable concentrations. Conclusions: IDentif.AI-designed combinations may provide alternative regimen options to current SOC combinations that are often administered with Amikacin, which has been known to induce ototoxicity in patients. Furthermore, IDentif.AI pinpointed 2-drug interactions may also serve as the backbone for the development of other effective 3- and 4-drug combination therapies. The findings in this study suggest that this platform may contribute to NTM-specific drug development.34223026<SEP>Lesley Cooper<SEP>Supporting global antimicrobial stewardship: antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of surgical site infection in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs): a scoping review and meta-analysis<SEP>Background: The Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group is supporting two hospitals in Ghana to develop antimicrobial stewardship. Early intelligence gathering suggested that surgical prophylaxis was suboptimal. We reviewed the evidence for use of surgical prophylaxis to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to inform this work. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL and Google Scholar were searched from inception to 17 February 2020 for trials, audits, guidelines and systematic reviews in English. Grey literature, websites and reference lists of included studies were searched. Randomized clinical trials reporting incidence of SSI following Caesarean section were included in two meta-analyses. Narrative analysis of studies that explored behaviours and attitudes was conducted. Results: This review included 51 studies related to SSI and timing of antibiotic prophylaxis in LMICs. Incidence of SSI is higher in LMICs, infection surveillance data are poor and there is a lack of local guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis. Education to improve appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with reduction of SSI in LMICs. The random-effects pooled mean risk ratio of SSI in Caesarean section was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.51-1.17) for pre-incision versus post-incision prophylaxis and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.55-1.14) for short versus long duration. Reduction in cost and nurse time was reported in shorter-duration surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. Conclusions: There is scope for improvement, but interventions must include local context and address strongly held beliefs. Establishment of local multidisciplinary teams will promote ownership and sustainability of change.37607805<SEP>Helen Smith<SEP>Clinicians and AI use: where is the professional guidance?<SEP>With the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) to healthcare, there is also a need for professional guidance to support its use. New (2022) reports from National Health Service AI Lab & Health Education England focus on healthcare workers' understanding and confidence in AI clinical decision support systems (AI-CDDSs), and are concerned with developing trust in, and the trustworthiness of these systems. While they offer guidance to aid developers and purchasers of such systems, they offer little specific guidance for the clinical users who will be required to use them in patient care.This paper argues that clinical, professional and reputational safety will be risked if this deficit of professional guidance for clinical users of AI-CDDSs is not redressed. We argue it is not enough to develop training for clinical users without first establishing professional guidance regarding the rights and expectations of clinical users.We conclude with a call to action for clinical regulators: to unite to draft guidance for users of AI-CDDS that helps manage clinical, professional and reputational risks. We further suggest that this exercise offers an opportunity to address fundamental issues in the use of AI-CDDSs; regarding, for example, the fair burden of responsibility for outcomes.29091191<SEP>Marion Bennie<SEP>Building a national Infection Intelligence Platform to improve antimicrobial stewardship and drive better patient outcomes: the Scottish experience<SEP>Background: The better use of new and emerging data streams to understand the epidemiology of infectious disease and to inform and evaluate antimicrobial stewardship improvement programmes is paramount in the global fight against antimicrobial resistance. Objectives: To create a national informatics platform that synergizes the wealth of disjointed, infection-related health data, building an intelligence capability that allows rapid enquiry, generation of new knowledge and feedback to clinicians and policy makers. Methods: A multi-stakeholder community, led by the Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group, secured government funding to deliver a national programme of work centred on three key aspects: (i) technical platform development with record linkage capability across multiple datasets; (ii) a proportionate governance approach to enhance responsiveness; and (iii) generation of new evidence to guide clinical practice. Results: The National Health Service Scotland Infection Intelligence Platform (IIP) is now hosted within the national health data repository to assure resilience and sustainability. New technical solutions include simplified 'data views' of complex, linked datasets and embedded statistical programs to enhance capability. These developments have enabled responsiveness, flexibility and robustness in conducting population-based studies including a focus on intended and unintended effects of antimicrobial stewardship interventions and quantification of infection risk factors and clinical outcomes. Conclusions: We have completed the build and test phase of IIP, overcoming the technical and governance challenges, and produced new capability in infection informatics, generating new evidence for improved clinical practice. This provides a foundation for expansion and opportunity for global collaborations.",

    "question": "What vaccines are recommended for adults?",
    "context": "31632610<SEP>Todd Watkins<SEP>A Demand for Data to Improve Outcomes Creates the Why to Move to Third Generation Immunization Information Systems<SEP>Investments over the past two decades to collect and store immunization events established a national population health data asset. The ability to track vaccine usage and storage has increased accountability, lowered wastage, protected valuable resources, and provided the correct vaccines at the right time. Sixty-four immunization registries support the current immunization ecosystem, yet all investments to date have been through state and federal funding. Much of the technology supporting these registries is becoming harder to support, limiting the utilization of the data. For the most part all current systems have legacy 2nd-generation technology and architectures as their foundation Current technology investments in these national assets tend to be for systems that within the next five years will not be cost effectively sustainable with only federal, state and local funding. Yet quality data is being reported by immunization providers across the health care network that is increasing exponentially through electronic data exchanges integrated within Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Pharmacy Management Systems (PMS) This increase in high-quality patient immunization records creates opportunity to build immunization intelligence from the data. However, 2nd-generation Immunization Information Systems (IIS) limit the effective and timely use of this information. Considering the increasing value of the data to public and private sectors working to close immunization care gaps in populations, supporting technology must ensure easy access This is the first of two papers that highlights the power of these national registries and the data they contain to provide opportunity intelligence to the immunization ecosystem user community. Paper one illustrates the \"why\" for change and the need for a truly community collaborative path forward to move from 2nd- to 3rd-generation systems through partners that leverages cost sharing and common goals The end goal is to establish new supporting technology assets that accelerate the use of data to impact vaccine preventable disease (VPD) outcomes which create a new model for public-private investments to sustain the IIS national infrastructure. The second a working paper with assumptions to be tested (\"Model for Sustaining and Investing in Immunization Information Systems\"), shares cost and investment strategies to complete the migration and create sustainable immunization systems for the future.33775449<SEP>Andreas H Laustsen<SEP>Animal Immunization, in Vitro Display Technologies, and Machine Learning for Antibody Discovery<SEP>For years, a discussion has persevered on the benefits and drawbacks of antibody discovery using animal immunization versus in vitro selection from non-animal-derived recombinant repertoires using display technologies. While it has been argued that using recombinant display libraries can reduce animal consumption, we hold that the number of animals used in immunization campaigns is dwarfed by the number sacrificed during preclinical studies. Thus, improving quality control of antibodies before entering in vivo studies will have a larger impact on animal consumption. Both animal immunization and recombinant repertoires present unique advantages for discovering antibodies that are fit for purpose. Furthermore, we anticipate that machine learning will play a significant role within discovery workflows, refining current antibody discovery practices.35060917<SEP>Camille Masselot<SEP>Implementing the Co-Immune Open Innovation Program to Address Vaccination Hesitancy and Access to Vaccines: Retrospective Study<SEP>Background: The rise of major complex public health problems, such as vaccination hesitancy and access to vaccination, requires innovative, open, and transdisciplinary approaches. Yet, institutional silos and lack of participation on the part of nonacademic citizens in the design of solutions hamper efforts to meet these challenges. Against this background, new solutions have been explored, with participatory research, citizen science, hackathons, and challenge-based approaches being applied in the context of public health. Objective: Our aim was to develop a program for creating citizen science and open innovation projects that address the contemporary challenges of vaccination in France and around the globe. Methods: We designed and implemented Co-Immune, a program created to tackle the question of vaccination hesitancy and access to vaccination through an online and offline challenge-based open innovation approach. The program was run on the open science platform Just One Giant Lab. Results: Over a 6-month period, the Co-Immune program gathered 234 participants of diverse backgrounds and 13 partners from the public and private sectors. The program comprised 10 events to facilitate the creation of 20 new projects, as well as the continuation of two existing projects, to address the issues of vaccination hesitancy and access, ranging from app development and data mining to analysis and game design. In an open framework, the projects made their data, code, and solutions publicly available. Conclusions: Co-Immune highlights how open innovation approaches and online platforms can help to gather and coordinate noninstitutional communities in a rapid, distributed, and global way toward solving public health issues. Such initiatives can lead to the production and transfer of knowledge, creating novel solutions in the public health sector. The example of Co-Immune contributes to paving the way for organizations and individuals to collaboratively tackle future global challenges.35966449<SEP>Mehdi A Kamran<SEP>A new vaccine supply chain network under COVID-19 conditions considering system dynamic: Artificial intelligence algorithms<SEP>With the discovery of the COVID-19 vaccine, what has always been worrying the decision-makers is related to the distribution management, the vaccination centers' location, and the inventory control of all types of vaccines. As the COVID-19 vaccine is highly demanded, planning for its fair distribution is a must. University is one of the most densely populated areas in a city, so it is critical to vaccinate university students so that the spread of this virus is curbed. As a result, in the present study, a new stochastic multi-objective, multi-period, and multi-commodity simulation-optimization model has been developed for the COVID-19 vaccine's production, distribution, location, allocation, and inventory control decisions. In this study, the proposed supply chain network includes four echelons of manufacturers, hospitals, vaccination centers, and volunteer vaccine students. Vaccine manufacturers send the vaccines to the vaccination centers and hospitals after production. The students with a history of special diseases such as heart disease, corticosteroids, blood clots, etc. are vaccinated in hospitals because of accessing more medical care, and the rest of the students are vaccinated in the vaccination centers. Then, a system dynamic structure of the prevalence of COVID -19 in universities is developed and the vaccine demand is estimated using simulation, in which the demand enters the mathematical model as a given stochastic parameter. Thus, the model pursues some goals, namely, to minimize supply chain costs, maximize student desirability for vaccination, and maximize justice in vaccine distribution. To solve the proposed model, Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) algorithms are used. In terms of novelties, the most important novelties in the simulation model are considering the virtual education and exerted quarantine effect on estimating the number of the vaccines. In terms of the mathematical model, one of the remarkable contributions is paying attention to social distancing while receiving the injection and the possibility of the injection during working and non-working hours, and regarding the novelties in the solution methodology, a new heuristic method based on a meta-heuristic algorithm called Modified WOA with VNS (MVWOA) is developed. In terms of the performance metrics and the CPU time, the MOWOA is discovered with a superior performance than other given algorithms. Moreover, regarding the data, a case study related to the COVID-19 pandemic period in Tehran/Iran is provided to validate the proposed algorithm. The outcomes indicate that with the demand increase, the costs increase sharply while the vaccination desirability for students decreases with a slight slope.",
    "answer": "Given the rich context provided regarding various angles of immunization, including the value of data in immunization systems, challenges in antibody discovery, addressing vaccine hesitancy, and supply chain management under pandemic conditions, the question about the recommended vaccines for adults can be approached comprehensively.\n\n### Recommended Vaccines for Adults\n\nThe recommended vaccines for adults can vary based on factors such as age, health conditions, lifestyle, travel plans, and what vaccines they have had in the past. Here are some of the commonly recommended vaccines for adults:\n\n1. **Influenza (Flu) Vaccine:** Recommended annually for all adults.\n2. **Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis (Tdap/Td) Booster:** The Tdap vaccine is usually given once, and a Td booster is recommended every 10 years.\n3. **Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine:** For adults up to age 26 who have not been previously vaccinated.\n4. **Zoster Vaccine:** To protect against shingles, recommended for adults aged 50 and older.\n5. **Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccine:** For those who have not received it as children or are at high risk.\n6. **Pneumococcal Vaccine:** For adults 65 years and older or younger adults with certain health conditions.\n7. **Hepatitis A and B Vaccines:** For those at risk due to certain health conditions, lifestyle, travel, or lack of previous vaccination.\n8. **Meningococcal Vaccine:** For individuals with specific medical conditions or who are traveling to certain areas.\n9. **COVID-19 Vaccine:** All adults should receive the COVID-19 vaccine and boosters as recommended by health authorities.\n\n### In the Context of the Provided Research:\n\n- **Data Systems (Context: 31632610):** As the population health data is improved and storages for vaccination events are established, these databases could be effectively used for identifying immunization care gaps, which, in turn, could influence adult vaccination recommendations\u2014emphasizing the need for targeted vaccines for specific populations.\n\n- **Antibody Discovery (Context: 33775449):** Advancements in antibody discovery, whether through animal immunization or in vitro techniques, can lead to the development of new vaccines, including those for adults.\n\n- **Vaccine Hesitancy (Context: 35060917):** Addressing vaccine hesitancy is crucial to ensure that adult populations are adequately vaccinated, according to recommendations. Open innovation programs like Co-Immune may contribute to education and outreach efforts to improve vaccine uptake.\n\n- **Supply Chain Network (Context: 35966449):** The complexity of vaccine distribution, including supply chain management, reflects the logistics involved in making vaccines available to all populations, including adults. Effective distribution ensures that recommended vaccines reach the end-users.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIt is important to consider individual health requirements and consult healthcare providers for personalized vaccine recommendations. Moreover, updated guidelines from centers like the CDC or WHO should be closely followed for the most current recommendations. Integration of data systems, advancement in medical research, innovative approaches to addressing hesitancy, and focusing on supply chain optimization collectively enhance the efficacy of immunization programs tailored for adult populations.",

    "context": "30544190<SEP>Angeline Chatelan<SEP>Precision nutrition: hype or hope for public health interventions to reduce obesity?<SEP>High-income countries are experiencing an obesity epidemic that follows a socioeconomic gradient, affecting groups of lower socioeconomic status disproportionately. Recent clinical findings have suggested new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of obesity, using personalized dietary approaches. Precision nutrition (PN), also called personalized nutrition, has been developed to deliver more preventive and practical dietary advice than 'one-size-fits-all' guidelines. With interventions becoming increasingly plausible at a large scale thanks to artificial intelligence and smartphone applications, some have begun to view PN as a novel way to deliver the right dietary intervention to the right population. We argue that large-scale PN, if taken alone, might be of limited interest from a public health perspective. Building on Geoffrey Rose's theory regarding the differences in individual and population causes of disease, we show that large-scale PN can only address some individual causes of obesity (causes of cases). This individual-centred approach is likely to have a small impact on the distribution of obesity at a population level because it ignores the population causes of obesity (causes of incidence). The latter are embedded in the populations' social, cultural, economic and political contexts that make environments obesogenic. Additionally, the most socially privileged groups in the population are the most likely to respond to large-scale PN interventions. This could have the undesirable effect of widening social inequalities in obesity. We caution public health actors that interventions based only on large-scale PN are unlikely, despite current expectations, to improve dietary intake or reduce obesity at a population level.34360170<SEP>Desiree A Lucassen<SEP>Short and Long-Term Innovations on Dietary Behavior Assessment and Coaching: Present Efforts and Vision of the Pride and Prejudice Consortium<SEP>Overweight, obesity and cardiometabolic diseases are major global health concerns. Lifestyle factors, including diet, have been acknowledged to play a key role in the solution of these health risks. However, as shown by numerous studies, and in clinical practice, it is extremely challenging to quantify dietary behaviors as well as influencing them via dietary interventions. As shown by the limited success of 'one-size-fits-all' nutritional campaigns catered to an entire population or subpopulation, the need for more personalized coaching approaches is evident. New technology-based innovations provide opportunities to further improve the accuracy of dietary assessment and develop approaches to coach individuals towards healthier dietary behaviors. Pride & Prejudice (P&P) is a unique multi-disciplinary consortium consisting of researchers in life, nutrition, ICT, design, behavioral and social sciences from all four Dutch Universities of Technology. P&P focuses on the development and integration of innovative technological techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, conversational agents, behavior change theory and personalized coaching to improve current practices and establish lasting dietary behavior change.37660022<SEP>Jingyuan Feng<SEP>Protocol of a parallel, randomized controlled trial on the effects of a novel personalized nutrition approach by artificial intelligence in real world scenario<SEP>Background: Nutrition service needs are huge in China. Previous studies indicated that personalized nutrition (PN) interventions were effective. The aim of the present study is to identify the effectiveness and feasibility of a novel PN approach supported by artificial intelligence (AI). Methods: This study is a two-arm parallel, randomized, controlled trial in real world scenario. The participants will be enrolled among who consume lunch at a staff canteen. In Phase I, a total of 170 eligible participants will be assigned to either intervention or control group on 1:1 ratio. The intervention group will be instructed to use the smartphone applet to record their lunches and reach the real-time AI-based information of dish nutrition evaluation and PN evaluation after meal consumption for 3 months. The control group will receive no nutrition information but be asked to record their lunches though the applet. Dietary pattern, body weight or blood pressure optimizing is expected after the intervention. In phase II, the applet will be free to all the diners (about 800) at the study canteen for another one year. Who use the applet at least 2 days per week will be regarded as the intervention group while the others will be the control group. Body metabolism normalization is expected after this period. Generalized linear mixed models will be used to identify the dietary, anthropometric and metabolic changes. Discussion: This novel approach will provide real-time AI-based dish nutrition evaluation and PN evaluation after meal consumption in order to assist users with nutrition information to make wise food choice. This study is designed under a real-life scenario which facilitates translating the trial intervention into real-world practice. Trial registration: This trial has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100051771; date registered: 03/10/2021).26947185<SEP>J R Blackshaw<SEP>Public health nutrition in the civil service (England): approaches to tackling obesity<SEP>The seriousness and scale of the physical, psychological, economic and societal consequences relating to poor diets, inactivity and obesity is unprecedented. Consequently, the contextual factors underpinning the work of a nutritionist in the civil service are complex and significant; however, there are real opportunities to make a difference and help improve the health of the nation. The present paper describes the delivery of public health nutrition through two work programmes, namely action to support young people develop healthier lifestyle choices and more recently the investigation and deployment of local insights to develop action to tackle obesity. Combining the application of nutrition expertise along with broader skills and approaches has enabled the translation of research and evidence into programmes of work to better the public's health. It is evident that the appropriate evaluation of such approaches has helped to deliver engaging and practical learning opportunities for young people. Furthermore, efforts to build on local intelligence and seek collaborative development can help inform the evidence base and seek to deliver public health approaches, which resonate with how people live their lives.",
    "answer": "Maintaining a healthy weight is important because it has a substantial impact on overall health and can help prevent a range of health concerns that are associated with being overweight or obese. From the context provided by the vector database, several perspectives on the importance of maintaining a healthy weight can be drawn:\n\n1. **Reducing the risk of obesity-related health conditions**: The papers highlight the prevalence of obesity and its association with socioeconomic status, indicating that groups of lower socioeconomic status are disproportionately affected. Obesity has been linked to numerous health issues, including cardiometabolic diseases, which are a major global health concern.\n\n2. **Personalized nutrition for effective interventions**: Research by Angeline Chatelan and others has emphasized the potential benefits of precision nutrition (PN), which provides personalized dietary advice compared to traditional 'one-size-fits-all' approaches. These personalized interventions, potentially enhanced by artificial intelligence and smartphone applications, could help individuals tailor their eating habits to better maintain a healthy weight and improve dietary intake.\n\n3. **Technological advancements in dietary behavior assessment**: Desiree A. Lucassen discusses the challenges in quantifying and influencing dietary behaviors, pointing out the limited success of conventional nutritional campaigns. With the Pride and Prejudice Consortium's focus on using AI, machine learning, and personalized coaching, the efforts to establish lasting dietary behavior change are more promising, which could lead to healthier weight management practices.\n\n4. **Real-world applications of artificial intelligence for nutrition**: Jingyuan Feng\u2019s study on a novel PN approach supported by AI in a real-world scenario illustrates how technology can assist individuals with making informed food choices, leading to potential optimizations in dietary patterns, body weight, blood pressure, and general body metabolism.\n\n5. **Public health and policy approaches**: J R Blackshaw\u2019s work emphasizes the public health nutrition efforts within the civil service, indicating that multi-faceted strategies need to be employed to address obesity. These strategies are likely to require collaboration and a focus on local insights to develop effective public health approaches that resonate with people's lives.\n\nMaintaining a healthy weight is thus not only important for individual health outcomes but also has broader implications for public health. It has the potential to alleviate some of the social and economic burdens associated with obesity, improve quality of life, and enhance the effectiveness of population-wide health interventions. While precision nutrition offers hope, it should be integrated with broader public health strategies that address the root causes of obesity, rather than acting in isolation. It must be cautioned that without addressing the environmental factors that contribute to obesity, such as obesogenic environments and socioeconomic disparities, advancements in personalized nutrition might not significantly impact obesity rates at the population level.",

It is estimated that about 500,000 lung cancer deaths and 1.6 million COPD deaths can be attributed to air pollution, but air pollution may also account for 19% of all cardiovascular deaths and 21% of all stroke deaths. Air pollution has been linked to other malignancies, such as bladder cancer and childhood leukemia. Lung development in childhood is stymied with exposure to air pollutants, and poor lung development in children predicts lung impairment in adults. Air pollution is associated with reduced cognitive function and increased risk of dementia. Particulate matter in the air (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 \u03bcm) is associated with delayed psychomotor development and lower child intelligence. Studies link air pollution with diabetes mellitus prevalence, morbidity, and mortality. Pollution affects the immune system and is associated with allergic rhinitis, allergic sensitization, and autoimmunity. It is also associated with osteoporosis and bone fractures, conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, blepharitis, inflammatory bowel disease, increased intravascular coagulation, and decreased glomerular filtration rate. Atopic and urticarial skin disease, acne, and skin aging are linked to air pollution.

    "answer": "From the provided context, while the direct question of the impact of **smoking** on lung health is not addressed, related information can be gleaned regarding the effects of **air pollution** on lung health and other systems of the body. I will draw parallels to smoking from these contexts, as both air pollution and smoking involve inhalation of harmful particulates and chemicals that can affect the lungs and other organs.\n\n**Impact of Smoking on Lung Health:**\n- *Respiratory Diseases:* Context 30419237 by Dean E Schraufnagel discusses the link between air pollution and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer deaths. Smoking is a well-established cause of both COPD and lung cancer as well, with similar mechanisms of lung damage and carcinogenesis due to inhaled toxicants.\n  \n- *Respiratory Development:* Context 37866291 by Stephanie von Hinke notes that lung development is hampered in children with exposure to air pollutants, leading to impaired lung function in adulthood. It is well-known that maternal smoking can lead to reduced lung function in offspring, indicating a parallel in the impact of inhaled pollutants from both sources.\n\n- *Respiratory Health:* Context 37507042 again by Stephanie von Hinke mentions worse respiratory health in individuals exposed to the London smog early in life. Smoking has a cumulative effect on respiratory health, with chronic exposure leading to conditions such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis, components of COPD.\n\nFrom the perspective of **multi-organ impact**, drawing parallels from the context might suggest that smoking, like air pollution, doesn't only affect the lungs but can also have systemic impacts, potentially affecting cardiovascular health, cognitive function, immune response, and other areas as highlighted in the provided studies.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAlthough the direct question about smoking was not specifically detailed in the context provided, one can infer the impact of smoking on lung health and other bodily systems by understanding the similar pathological effects that air pollution has on the body, as indicated by the research studies. Smoking, like air pollution, exposes the body to harmful substances that can lead to chronic respiratory diseases, impaired lung development, and multi-organ system damage. Highlighting the systemic nature of these impacts underscores the importance of mitigating exposure, whether from air pollution or smoking, for the preservation of health across various bodily functions.",

The recently developed metric for physical activity (PA) tracking called Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) takes into account age, sex, resting and maximum heart rate, and a score of \u2265100 weekly PAI has been shown to reduce the risk of premature CVD death in healthy as well as individuals with known CVD risk factors, regardless of whether or not the current PA recommendations were met. The aim of the present study was to examine if PAI modifies the associations between SB and CVD risk factor (CV-RF) clustering in a large apparently healthy general population cohort (n=29,950, aged \u226520 years). Logistic regression revealed that in those with \u2265100 weekly PAI, the likelihood of CV-RF clustering prevalence associated with prolonged SB was attenuated across age groups. Monitoring weekly PAI-level could be useful to ensure that people perform enough PA to combat SB's deleterious association with CV-RF.33370551<SEP>Javaid Nauman<SEP>Temporal changes in personal activity intelligence and mortality: Data from the aerobics center longitudinal study<SEP>Background: Personal activity intelligence (PAI) is a metric developed to simplify a physically active lifestyle for the participants. Regardless of following today's advice for physical activity, a PAI score \u2265100 per week at baseline, an increase in PAI score, and a sustained high PAI score over time were found to delay premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality in a large population of Norwegians. However, the association between long-term temporal change in PAI and mortality in other populations have not been investigated. Objective: To test whether temporal change in PAI is associated with CVD and all-cause mortality in a large population from the United States. Methods: We studied 17,613 relatively healthy participants who received at least two medical examinations in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study between 1974 and 2002. The participant's weekly PAI scores were estimated twice, and adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CVD and all-cause mortality related to changes in PAI between baseline and last examination were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. Results: During a median follow-up time of 9.3 years [interquartile range, 2.6-16.6; 181,765 person-years], there were 1144 deaths, including 400 CVD deaths. We observed an inverse linear association between change in PAI and risk of CVD mortality (P=0.007 for linear trend, and P=0.35 for quadratic trend). Compared to participants with zero PAI at both examinations, multivariable-adjusted analyses demonstrated that participants who maintained high PAI scores (\u2265100 PAI at both examinations) had a 51% reduced risk of CVD mortality [AHR, 0.49: 95% CI, 0.26-0.95)], and 42% reduced risk of all-cause mortality [AHR, 0.58: 95% CI, 0.41-0.83)]. For participants who increased their PAI scores over time (PAI score of zero at first examination and \u2265100 at last examination), the AHRs were 0.75 (95% CI, 0.55-1.02) for CVD mortality, and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69-0.99) for all-cause mortality. Participants who maintained high PAI score had 4.8 (95% CI, 3.3-6.4) years of life gained. For those who increased their PAI score over time, the corresponding years gained were 1.8 years (95% CI, 0.1-3.5). Conclusion: Among relatively healthy participants, an increase in PAI and maintaining a high PAI score over time was associated with reduced risk of CVD and all-cause mortality. Condensed abstract: Our objective was to investigate the association between temporal changes in PAI and mortality in a large population from the United States. In this prospective cohort study of 17,613 relatively healthy participants at baseline, maintaining a high PAI score and an increase in PAI score over an average period of 6.3 years was associated with a significant reduction in CVD and all-cause mortality. Based on our results, clinicians can easily recommend that patients obtain at least 100 PAI for most favourable protection against CVD- and all-cause mortality, but can also mention that significant benefits also occur at maintaining low-to-moderate PAI levels.30227185<SEP>Sophie K Kieffer<SEP>Temporal Changes in a Novel Metric of Physical Activity Tracking (Personal Activity Intelligence) and Mortality: The HUNT Study, Norway<SEP>Background: Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a novel activity metric that translates heart rate variations during exercise into a weekly score. Weekly PAI scores assessed at a single point in time were found to associate with lower risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the general healthy population. However, to date, the associations between long-term longitudinal changes in weekly PAI scores and mortality have not been explored. Purpose: The aim of the present study was to prospectively examine the association between change in weekly PAI scores estimated 10 years apart, and risk of mortality from CVD and all-causes. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of 11,870 men and 13,010 women without known CVD in Norway. By using data from the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (HUNT), PAI was estimated twice, ten years apart (HUNT1 1984-86 and HUNT2 1995-97). Mortality was followed-up until December 31, 2015. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for death from CVD and all-causes related to temporal changes in PAI were estimated using Cox regression analyses. Results: During a mean (SD) of 18 (4) years of follow-up, there were 4782 deaths, including 1560 deaths caused by CVD. Multi-adjusted analyses demonstrated that participants achieving a score of \u2265100 PAI at both time points had 32% lower risk of CVD mortality (AHR 0.68; CI: 0.54-0.86) for CVD mortality and 20% lower risk of all-cause mortality (AHR 0.80; CI: 71-0.91) compared with participants obtaining <100 weekly PAI at both measurements. For participants having <100 PAI in HUNT1 but \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2, the AHRs were 0.87 (CI: 0.74-1.03) for CVD mortality, and 0.86 (CI: 0.79-0.95) for all-cause mortality. We also found an inverse linear relationship between change in PAI and risk of CVD mortality among participants with 0 PAI (P < 0.01), and \u226450 PAI (P = 0.04) in HUNT1, indicating that an increase in PAI over time is associated with lower risk of mortality. Excluding the first three years of follow-up did not substantially alter the findings. Increasing PAI score from <100 PAI in HUNT1 to \u2265100 PAI in HUNT2 was associated with 6.6 years gained lifespan. Conclusion: Among men and women without known CVD, an increase in PAI score and sustained high PAI score over a 10-year period was associated with lower risk of mortality.30193673<SEP>Sophie K Kieffer<SEP>Personal Activity Intelligence and Mortality in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease: The HUNT Study<SEP>Objective: To test whether Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI), a personalized metric of physical activity (PA) tracking, is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in patients with self-reported CVD and to determine whether these associations change depending on whether contemporary PA recommendations are met. Patients and methods: A total of 3133 patients with CVD (mean [SD] age, 67.6 [10.3] years; 64% men) were followed from the date of participation in the Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag Health Study (between January 1, 1984, and February 28, 1986) until the date of death or the end of follow-up (December 31, 2015). The participants' weekly PAI score was calculated and divided into 4 groups (PAI scores of 0, \u226450, 51-99, and \u2265100). We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios for CVD and all-cause mortality rates. Results: After mean follow-up of 12.5 years (39,157 person-years), there were 2936 deaths (94%), including 1936 CVD deaths. Participants with weekly PAI scores of 100 or greater had 36% (95% CI, 21%-48%) and 24% (95% CI, 10%-35%) lower risk of mortality from CVD and all causes, respectively, compared with the inactive group. Participants had similar risk reductions associated with their weekly PAI scores regardless of following contemporary PA recommendations or not. Conclusion: Obtaining a weekly PAI score of at least 100 was associated with lower mortality risk from CVD and all causes in individuals with CVD regardless of whether the current PA recommendations were met.",
    "answer": "Regular exercise is beneficial for cardiac health for several reasons, which can be understood by examining key findings from the research context provided:\n\n1. **Combating Sedentary Behavior:** Prolonged sedentary behavior is positively associated with clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Regular physical activity counteracts the harmful effects of sedentary behavior by improving cardiovascular function and reducing risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and glucose intolerance.\n\n2. **Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI):** PAI is a metric that reflects the heart rate response to physical activity, considering age, sex, resting, and maximum heart rate. A score of PAI \u2265100 weekly has been shown to reduce the risk of premature CVD death in individuals, both healthy and those with known CVD risk factors. Regular exercise would help individuals achieve or maintain a PAI \u2265100, thereby offering protection against CVD mortality.\n\n3. **Temporal Changes in PAI and Mortality:** Studies have shown that an increase in PAI over time, as well as maintaining a high PAI score, is associated with a reduced risk of CVD and all-cause mortality. This implies that not only is it important to engage in regular exercise but also to maintain or increase the intensity or frequency of exercise over time to ensure continued benefits for cardiac health.\n\n4. **Extension of Life Expectancy:** Regular exercise and the associated improvement in PAI correlated with an increase in years of life gained. Participants who maintained or increased their PAI score over time saw substantial increases in life expectancy, further underscoring the benefits of regular exercise for cardiac health.\n\n5. **Follow-Up Studies:** Broadly, follow-up studies reinforce the idea that regular exercise, personalized to an individual's cardiovascular response as measured by PAI, offers a significant protective effect against CVD mortality and all-cause mortality.\n\nIn summary, regular exercise improves cardiac health by mitigating the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle, optimizing cardiovascular responses, reducing CVD risk factors, and extending life expectancy. The concept of Personal Activity Intelligence helps individuals and healthcare providers gauge whether the amount and intensity of exercise performed are sufficient to confer these cardiac benefits.",

    "context": "36965693<SEP>Tanveer Talukdar<SEP>Integrating Nutrient Biomarkers, Cognitive Function, and Structural MRI Data to Build Multivariate Phenotypes of Healthy Aging<SEP>Background: Research in the emerging field of nutritional cognitive neuroscience demonstrates that many aspects of nutrition-from entire diets to specific nutrients-affect cognitive performance and brain health. Objectives: Although previous research has primarily examined the bivariate relationship between nutrition and cognition or nutrition and brain health, this study sought to investigate the joint relationship between these essential and interactive elements of human health. Methods: We applied a state-of-the-art data fusion method, coupled matrix tensor factorization, to characterize the joint association between measures of nutrition (52 nutrient biomarkers), cognition (Wechsler Abbreviated Test of Intelligence and Wechsler Memory Scale), and brain health (high-resolution MRI measures of structural brain volume) within a cross-sectional sample of 111 healthy older adults, with an average age of 69.1 y, 62% being female, and an average body mass index of 26.0 kg/m2. Results: Data fusion uncovered latent factors that capture the joint association between specific nutrient profiles, cognitive measures, and cortical volumes, demonstrating the respects in which these health domains are coupled. A hierarchical cluster analysis further revealed systematic differences between a subset of variables contributing to the underlying latent factors, providing evidence for multivariate phenotypes that represent high and low levels of performance across multiple health domains. The primary features that distinguish between each phenotype were as follows: 1) nutrient biomarkers for monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids; 2) cognitive measures of immediate, auditory, and delayed memory; and 3) brain volumes within frontal, temporal, and parietal cortexes. Conclusions: By incorporating innovations in nutritional epidemiology (nutrient biomarker analysis), cognitive neuroscience (high-resolution structural brain imaging), and statistics (data fusion), this study provides an interdisciplinary synthesis of methods that elucidate how nutrition, cognition, and brain health are integrated through lifestyle choices that affect healthy aging.25268900<SEP>Matthew P Pase<SEP>An evidence-based method for examining and reporting cognitive processes in nutrition research<SEP>Cognitive outcomes are frequently implemented as endpoints in nutrition research. To reduce the number of statistical comparisons it is commonplace for nutrition researchers to combine cognitive test results into a smaller number of broad cognitive abilities. However, there is a clear lack of understanding and consensus as to how best execute this practice. The present paper reviews contemporary models of human cognition and proposes a standardised, evidence-based method for grouping cognitive test data into broader cognitive abilities. Both Carroll's model of human cognitive ability and the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence provide empirically based taxonomies of human cognition. These models provide a cognitive 'map' that can be used to guide the handling and analysis of cognitive outcomes in nutrition research. Making use of a valid cognitive nomenclature can provide the field of clinical nutrition with a common cognitive language enabling efficient comparisons of cognitive outcomes across studies. This will make it easier for researchers, policymakers and readers to interpret and compare cognitive outcomes for different interventions. Using an empirically derived cognitive nomenclature to guide the creation of cognitive composite scores will ensure that cognitive endpoints are theoretically valid and meaningful. This will increase the generalisability of trial results to the general population. The present review also discusses how the CHC model of cognition can also guide the synthesis of cognitive outcomes in systematic reviews and meta-analysis.35153713<SEP>Yauhen Statsenko<SEP>Brain Morphometry and Cognitive Performance in Normal Brain Aging: Age- and Sex-Related Structural and Functional Changes<SEP>Background: The human brain structure undergoes considerable changes throughout life. Cognitive function can be affected either negatively or positively. It is challenging to segregate normal brain aging from the accelerated one. Objective: To work out a descriptive model of brain structural and functional changes in normal aging. Materials and methods: By using voxel-based morphometry and lesion segmentation along with linear statistics and machine learning (ML), we analyzed the structural changes in the major brain compartments and modeled the dynamics of neurofunctional performance throughout life. We studied sex differences in lifelong dynamics of brain volumetric data with Mann-Whitney U-test. We tested the hypothesis that performance in some cognitive domains might decline as a linear function of age while other domains might have a non-linear dependence on it. We compared the volumetric changes in the major brain compartments with the dynamics of psychophysiological performance in 4 age groups. Then, we tested linear models of structural and functional decline for significant differences between the slopes in age groups with the T-test. Results: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are not the major structural determinant of the brain normal aging. They should be viewed as signs of a disease. There is a sex difference in the speed and/or in the onset of the gray matter atrophy. It either starts earlier or goes faster in males. Marked sex difference in the proportion of total cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and intraventricular CSF (iCSF) justifies that elderly men are more prone to age-related brain atrophy than women of the same age. Conclusion: The article gives an overview and description of the conceptual structural changes in the brain compartments. The obtained data justify distinct patterns of age-related changes in the cognitive functions. Cross-life slowing of decision-making may follow the linear tendency of enlargement of the interhemispheric fissure because the center of task switching and inhibitory control is allocated within the medial wall of the frontal cortex, and its atrophy accounts for the expansion of the fissure.

Less is known about the effects of diet on brain function and cognition in the general population (Ames, 2010; Parletta et al., 2013; White et al., 2017) and we are still in the early stages of understanding the role of specific nutrients to normal and pathological neuronal functioning. In the present study, the putative effect of a multivitamin/mineral or vitamin D supplement on cognitive function over an 8-week period was compared with volunteers taking vitamin C. Healthy adults (N = 60) were recruited, age range 21-59 years ( x \u00af = 39.07 years, SD = 11.46), with participants randomly allocated to conditions in a double-blind protocol. Participants also completed a 14-day food diary to gather information on micronutrient intake. The cognitive test battery included measures from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III; Wechsler et al., 2008), Wechsler Memory Scale-IV (WMS-IV; Wechsler, 2009) and Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS; Delis et al., 2001), along with the Doors and People (Baddeley et al., 1994) and a serial reaction time task. Analyses showed better performance on some tasks in all groups following the intervention period, notably on measures of verbal and visual memory and visuomotor processing speed. The Multivitamin group showed significant improvements on tasks of visual strategy generation (along with the Vitamin C group), motor planning, explicit and implicit learning, and working memory. This evidence suggests that sub-optimal micronutrient intake may have a negative effect on cognition across the lifespan.",
    "answer": "Based on the context provided from a variety of studies in the field of nutritional cognitive neuroscience and related areas, it becomes evident that a balanced diet plays a crucial role in contributing to overall well-being, particularly in the context of healthy aging:\n\n1. **Integration of Nutrition and Brain Health**: The study represented by Tanveer Talukdar employs a sophisticated data fusion method to explore the joint associations between nutritional intake, cognitive function, and brain health. The study found correlations between specific nutrient biomarkers (notably monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids), cognitive measures, and brain volumes within certain cortex areas. This suggests that balanced diets, rich in beneficial fats, can support cognitive capabilities and contribute to maintaining healthy brain structures, which are central to overall well-being.\n\n2. **Standardizing Cognitive Assessment in Nutrition Research**: The work done by Matthew P Pase emphasizes the importance of employing evidence-based methods when examining cognitive outcomes in nutrition research. This provides a standardized approach, making it easier to compare results across studies and better understand the cognitive impact of nutritional interventions. It implies that when balanced diets are studied with respect to cognitive functions, having a clear and consistent cognitive framework helps in clarifying how diets promote well-being through cognitive health.\n\n3. **Brain Aging and Cognitive Performance**: Research by Yauhen Statsenko examines how aging affects brain structure and cognitive function. The findings underscore that while certain cognitive functions may decline with age, some changes may be mitigated or influenced by lifestyle choices, including diet. This implies that balanced nutrition can potentially moderate age-related cognitive decline and structural brain changes, supporting well-being as one ages.\n\n4. **Micronutrient Interventions and Cognition**: The study by Rebecca J Denniss provides evidence that micronutrient supplements can lead to improvements in cognitive function, suggesting that even in the general, relatively healthy population, nutrient intake is linked to cognitive performance. Therefore, a balanced diet that ensures adequate micronutrient intake is likely vital for maintaining cognitive function, which is an important aspect of overall well-being.\n\nIn summary, diverse studies converge on the concept that a balanced diet, supplying essential nutrients, is closely tied to cognitive performance, brain health, and aging processes. It influences structural and functional aspects of the brain and plays a role in maintaining cognitive abilities over time. These dynamics underscore the importance of a balanced diet in not just physical health, but also in cognitive functioning and mental well-being, demonstrating the intertwined nature of nutrition and overall well-being.\n\n**Conclusion**: A balanced diet holds a significant position at the intersection of nutrition, cognition, and brain health, influencing how individuals age and maintain their cognitive capabilities. The studies presented offer multivariate insights into the positive effects of a balanced diet on comprehensive health domains, supporting the notion that diet is a controllable lifestyle factor that contributes significantly to overall well-being, particularly in the context of aging and cognitive preservation.",

In addition, salinization jeopardizes agroecosystems, inducing salt stress in most cultivated plants (nutrient deficiency, pH and oxidative stress, biomass reduction), and directly affects the quality and quantity of food production. Depending on the type of salt/stress (alkaline or pH-neutral), specific approaches and solutions should be applied to ameliorate the situation on-site. Various agro-hydrotechnical (soil and water conservation, reduced tillage, mulching, rainwater harvesting, irrigation and drainage, control of seawater intrusion), biological (agroforestry, multi-cropping, cultivation of salt-resistant species, bacterial inoculation, promotion of mycorrhiza, grafting with salt-resistant rootstocks), chemical (application of organic and mineral amendments, phytohormones), bio-ecological (breeding, desalination, application of nano-based products, seed biopriming), and/or institutional solutions (salinity monitoring, integrated national and regional strategies) are very effective against salinity/salt stress and numerous other constraints. Advances in computer science (artificial intelligence, machine learning) provide rapid predictions of salinization processes from the field to the global scale, under numerous scenarios, including climate change. Thus, these results represent a comprehensive outcome and tool for a multidisciplinary approach to protect and control salinization, minimizing damages caused by salt stress.34357339<SEP>Morena M Tinte<SEP>Metabolomics-Guided Elucidation of Plant Abiotic Stress Responses in the 4IR Era: An Overview<SEP>Plants are constantly challenged by changing environmental conditions that include abiotic stresses. These are limiting their development and productivity and are subsequently threatening our food security, especially when considering the pressure of the increasing global population. Thus, there is an urgent need for the next generation of crops with high productivity and resilience to climate change. The dawn of a new era characterized by the emergence of fourth industrial revolution (4IR) technologies has redefined the ideological boundaries of research and applications in plant sciences. Recent technological advances and machine learning (ML)-based computational tools and omics data analysis approaches are allowing scientists to derive comprehensive metabolic descriptions and models for the target plant species under specific conditions. Such accurate metabolic descriptions are imperatively essential for devising a roadmap for the next generation of crops that are resilient to environmental deterioration. By synthesizing the recent literature and collating data on metabolomics studies on plant responses to abiotic stresses, in the context of the 4IR era, we point out the opportunities and challenges offered by omics science, analytical intelligence, computational tools and big data analytics. Specifically, we highlight technological advancements in (plant) metabolomics workflows and the use of machine learning and computational tools to decipher the dynamics in the chemical space that define plant responses to abiotic stress conditions.35406950<SEP>Amanda Kim Rico-Ch\u00e1vez<SEP>Machine Learning for Plant Stress Modeling: A Perspective towards Hormesis Management<SEP>Plant stress is one of the most significant factors affecting plant fitness and, consequently, food production. However, plant stress may also be profitable since it behaves hormetically; at low doses, it stimulates positive traits in crops, such as the synthesis of specialized metabolites and additional stress tolerance. The controlled exposure of crops to low doses of stressors is therefore called hormesis management, and it is a promising method to increase crop productivity and quality. Nevertheless, hormesis management has severe limitations derived from the complexity of plant physiological responses to stress. Many technological advances assist plant stress science in overcoming such limitations, which results in extensive datasets originating from the multiple layers of the plant defensive response. For that reason, artificial intelligence tools, particularly Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), have become crucial for processing and interpreting data to accurately model plant stress responses such as genomic variation, gene and protein expression, and metabolite biosynthesis. In this review, we discuss the most recent ML and DL applications in plant stress science, focusing on their potential for improving the development of hormesis management protocols.37944316<SEP>Cristian Rossi<SEP>Breaking the ESG rating divergence: An open geospatial framework for environmental scores<SEP>Information about a company's environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance has become increasingly important in the decision-making process of financial institutions. The financial implications of environmental challenges (e.g. water stress), negative social impacts (e.g. health impacts in local communities) or poor corporate governance (e.g. breaching legislation) all continue to increase. Accordingly, there is a need for financial institutions to incorporate information on ESG risks, opportunities and impacts in decisions that relate to risk management, investments, credit, strategy, and reporting. ESG information is typically disseminated through ESG ratings, which combine the three constituents into a single rating, or ascribe them separate scores. The compilation of ESG ratings and the identification of appropriate data sources is an inherently complex process; as such, there is no single standard for data collection or reporting. This has led to a divergence in the underlying data sources used by different rating providers, as well as in the determination of factors that are deemed worthy of measurement in the first place. For example, when assessing a company's environmental impact, one rating provider may rely on company-provided data, while another may incorporate independent third-party assessments. Unfortunately, there is currently no clear mechanism for effectively resolving such disagreements to establish a standardised approach to ESG rating assessments. However, geospatial data and analyses offer several key advantages for ESG assessments, including consistency, the potential for enhanced accuracy, and the ability to identify and assess environmental impacts at a detailed physical asset level, in addition to evaluating the broader spatial context. By incorporating geospatial information (obtained through manually processing remotely sensed data, or by using existing products) rating methodologies can be improved, and disparities can be addressed more effectively. This would enable a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental considerations of ESG assessments, promoting a more informed and precise decision-making process. Within this context, a few institutions (e.g. the University of Oxford, the WWF, and a few others) are pioneering thought leadership around spatial finance, including the assessment of ESG issues utilising geospatial intelligence, but there are no consistent frameworks for incorporating geospatial data into ESG ratings and analysis. This paper explores the opportunity for such a geospatial environmental scoring framework, defining a variety of methods in which open data with broad geographic coverage could be incorporated into ESG analysis, generalisable to a range of assets and sectors. The proposed framework is organised into two categories: localised effects, which directly impact the immediate vicinity of an asset, and delocalised effects, which contribute to global climate change and atmospheric pollution. Sub-scores are defined within these categories, which capture both the localised effects on land use, biodiversity, soils, and hydrology, and the global impacts resulting from atmospheric emissions. The approaches for handling geospatial data to generate both these sub-scores and the final E-score are presented, including a test case, and the complete methodology is made available in open repositories.",
    "answer": "Given the context provided by the various studies and articles, it is evident that adequate hydration is important for multiple reasons, spanning from agricultural concerns to the broader environmental impact assessed by ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) ratings. Let's delve into these perspectives:\n\n**Plant Health and Food Security (Context: 35336599 & 34357339):**\nAdequate hydration is essential for plant health, especially when dealing with salt stress in agroecosystems, as mentioned by Gabrijel Ondrasek. Plants experiencing salt stress due to inadequate hydration may suffer from nutrient deficiency, changes in pH, oxidative stress, and biomass reduction, which directly affect food production and quality. Additionally, Morena M Tinte highlights the importance of plant resilience to abiotic stressors, which is contingent on understanding plant hydration needs to ensure high productivity and climate change adaptability. Thus, from a plant science perspective, proper irrigation and hydration are crucial for mitigating salt stress and supporting the development of stress-resilient crops, ensuring food security.\n\n**Plant Stress Modeling and Hormesis Management (Context: 35406950):**\nAmanda Kim Rico-Ch\u00e1vez discusses hormesis management, which takes advantage of controlled stress, including hydration levels, to stimulate positive plant traits. Adequate hydration supports the proper calibration of stressors to promote beneficial hormetic effects. Inaccurate or insufficient hydration might disrupt the delicate balance required for hormesis, leading to chronic stress instead of beneficial outcomes. Therefore, proper understanding and execution of hydration practices are integral to optimizing plant production and quality through hormesis management.\n\n**Environmental Impact and ESG Assessment (Context: 37944316):**\nCristian Rossi points out the significance of ESG ratings for assessing company performance, which includes environmental impacts like water stress. Adequate hydration correlates with responsible water use and management in agriculture, industry, and urban settings. Inadequate water stewardship leads to environmental detriments\u2014such as degraded ecosystems, reduced water quality, and insufficient water supply for communities and natural habitats\u2014negatively affecting ESG ratings and, ultimately, financial decisions. Ensuring adequate hydration supports better ESG outcomes and a more responsible, sustainable approach to environmental resources.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAdequate hydration is important across diverse contexts because it fosters plant health, supports crop resilience strategies, enhances food security, optimizes stress-induced beneficial traits in agriculture, and aligns with responsible environmental practices assessed by ESG ratings. Consequently, it is not just about maintaining the essential biological processes within plants, but also about ensuring sustainable practices are in place to protect soil health, water quality, and the intricate balance of ecosystems that are fundamental to life on Earth. Advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and geospatial technologies, as reflected in the context provided, offer promising tools to better understand, model, and manage hydration for both immediate plant health and broader environmental well-being.",

Factors such as the presence of previous mental or physical illness, resilience or emotional intelligence may influence the occurrence or increase of stress. The aim was to assess predictors of stress by comparing two statistical methodologies (one linear and one non-linear).34017287<SEP>Francisco Manuel Morales-Rodr\u00edguez<SEP>Stress, Coping, and Resilience Before and After COVID-19: A Predictive Model Based on Artificial Intelligence in the University Environment<SEP>The COVID-19 global health emergency has greatly impacted the educational field. Faced with unprecedented stress situations, professors, students, and families have employed various coping and resilience strategies throughout the confinement period. High and persistent stress levels are associated with other pathologies; hence, their detection and prevention are needed. Consequently, this study aimed to design a predictive model of stress in the educational field based on artificial intelligence that included certain sociodemographic variables, coping strategies, and resilience capacity, and to study the relationship between them. The non-probabilistic snowball sampling method was used, involving 337 people (73% women) from the university education community in south-eastern Spain. The Perceived Stress Scale, Stress Management Questionnaire, and Brief Resilience Scale were administered. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 24) was used to design the architecture of artificial neural networks. The results found that stress levels could be predicted by the synaptic weights of coping strategies and timing of the epidemic (before and after the implementation of isolation measures), with a predictive capacity of over 80% found in the neural network model. Additionally, direct and significant associations were identified between the use of certain coping strategies, stress levels, and resilience. The conclusions of this research are essential for effective stress detection, and therefore, early intervention in the field of educational psychology, by discussing the influence of resilience or lack thereof on the prediction of stress levels. Identifying the variables that maintain a greater predictive power in stress levels is an effective strategy to design more adjusted prevention programs and to anticipate the needs of the community.34629581<SEP>Max Sadovyy<SEP>COVID-19: How the stress generated by the pandemic may affect work performance through the moderating role of emotional intelligence<SEP>This study aimed to assess the moderating effect of emotional intelligence (EI) in the direct impact of the stress generated by the pandemic on work performance and counterproductive work behaviors (CWB) in a multioccupational sample of 1048 professionals (60.7% women). The participants filled the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Impact of Event Scale 6 and the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire. The results proved a relationship between Covid stress, performance and EI, which has a moderating effect between the stress and both indicators of performance, even when sociodemographic variables were controlled. In essence, professionals with high levels of EI and low Covid stress showed the highest performance and the lowest CWB when compared to those who presented less emotional capabilities and higher stress. These results confirm the importance of EI in improving the effectiveness of work performance and reinforce the role of EI as a protective variable that can safeguard occupational health.34479820<SEP>Sarada Ghosh<SEP>Application of non-parametric models for analyzing survival data of COVID-19 patients<SEP>Background: COVID-19 Coronavirus variants are emerging across the globe causing ongoing pandemics. It is important to estimate the case fatality ratio (CFR) during such an epidemic of a potentially fatal disease. Methods: Firstly, we have performed a non-parametric approach for odds ratios with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) and illustrated relative risks and cumulative mortality rates of COVID-19 data of Spain. We have demonstrated the modified non-parametric approach based on Kaplan-Meier (KM) technique using COVID-19 data of Italy. We have also performed the significance of characteristics of patients regarding outcome by age for both genders. Furthermore, we have applied a non-parametric cure model using Nadaraya-Watson weight to estimate cure-rate using Israel data. Simulations are based on R-software. Results: The analytical illustrations of these approaches predict the effects of patients based on covariates in different scenarios. Sex differences are increased from ages less than 60 years to 60-69 years but decreased thereafter with the smallest sex difference at ages 80 years in a case for estimating both purposes RR (relative risk) and OR (odds ratio). The non-parametric approach investigates the range of cure-rate ranges from 5.3% to 9% and from 4% to 7% approximately for male and female respectively. The modified KM estimator performs for such censored data and detects the changes in CFR more rapidly for both genders and age-wise. Conclusion: Older-age, male-sex, number of comorbidities and access to timely health care are identified as some of the risk factors associated with COVID-19 mortality in Spain. The non-parametric approach has investigated the influence of covariates on models and it provides the effect in both genders and age. The health impact of public for inaccurate estimates, inconsistent intelligence, conflicting messages, or resulting in misinformation can increase awareness among people and also induce panic situations that accompany major outbreaks of COVID-19.",
    "answer": "Stress influences mental health in a significant way, affecting both psychological well-being and physical health. The provided context from research across various studies helps to understand the nuances of this impact, focusing on the unique circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Laura Lacomba-Trejo's research** points out that confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain had a substantial emotional impact, leading to increased levels of stress. The study implies that having a previous mental or physical illness, as well as individual factors such as resilience or emotional intelligence, could influence the occurrence or intensification of stress. This suggests that stress doesn't act in isolation but is rather moderated by a range of personal characteristics.\n\n**Francisco Manuel Morales-Rodr\u00edguez** delves into the educational context, highlighting that the pandemic brought about significant stress for professors, students, and families. The artificial intelligence-based predictive model proposed in this study includes sociodemographic variables, coping strategies, and resilience capacity. Notably, this research showed that stress levels can be anticipated using these variables, with particular coping strategies and the timing of the pandemic (before and after isolation measures) serving as strong predictors. It further reinforces the concept that stress can be interlinked with and mitigated by effective coping strategies and resilience.\n\n**Max Sadovyy's study** expands upon the concept of emotional intelligence (EI) as a buffer against stress, assessing its role in work performance during the pandemic. The findings indicate that high levels of EI can moderate the impact of stress, leading to better work performance and reduced counterproductive behaviors. This underscores emotional intelligence not just as a personal asset but as a critical factor in occupational health and efficacy.\n\nLastly, **Sarada Ghosh** addresses the non-parametric analysis of survival data for COVID-19 patients, providing a broader perspective on the impact of stress on health outcomes. While not addressing mental health directly, the study emphasizes that age, sex, and comorbidities are key factors in COVID-19 mortality, indirectly suggesting that the stress incurred by the pandemic may exacerbate preexisting vulnerabilities in the population, which in turn can impact mental health.\n\nIn summary, the evidence from the context provided strongly suggests that stress during the COVID-19 pandemic has been influenced by a variety of factors and has a significant impact on mental health. From affecting performance in the workplace to exacerbating the effects of confinement, the role of individual characteristics like resilience and emotional intelligence is crucial. These factors either mitigate or intensify the impact of stress, thus influencing mental health outcomes. The research underscores the importance of understanding personal and sociodemographic variables to mitigate stress and safeguard mental health during extraordinary times like a pandemic.",

    "context": "33988545<SEP>Junyeon Won<SEP>Cardiovascular Endurance Modifies the Link between Subjective Sleep Quality and Entorhinal Cortex Thickness in Younger Adults<SEP>Introduction: Poor sleep is linked to impaired cognitive function, cortical brain atrophy, and lower cortical thickness. Independently, higher cardiovascular endurance has neuroprotective effects. It remains in question, however, whether cardiovascular endurance moderates the relationship between sleep and brain health. The aims of this study included the following: 1) the association between subjective sleep quality and cognitive performance, hippocampus volume, and entorhinal cortex (EC) thickness, and 2) the moderating effects of cardiovascular endurance on the associations of sleep quality with cognitive and magnetic resonance imaging measures in healthy younger adults. Methods: A total of 1095 younger adults (28.8 \u00b1 3.6 yr) from the Human Connectome Project were included in the analyses. The 2-min walk test was used as a proxy of cardiovascular endurance. Self-reported sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Composite cognitive tests were used to assess global cognition, and T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging data (obtained using Siemens 3T scanner) was used to assess hippocampus volume and EC thickness. Linear regression was used to examine the moderating effects of fitness on the relationships between sleep and each of these neurocognitive outcomes after controlling for age, sex, and education year. Results: Poorer sleep quality was associated with both a lower crystalized intelligence score (B = -0.198, P = 0.034) and lower EC thickness (B = -0.013, P = 0.003). With greater 2-min walk test score, the association between greater Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score and lower EC thickness was attenuated (B = 0.0008, P = 0.028). Conclusions: Higher cardiovascular endurance may mitigate the relationship between poorer subjective sleep quality and lower EC thickness. Future longitudinal studies should examine the interactive effects of sleep and fitness on brain health among older and more vulnerable populations.29776624<SEP>Michelle A Short<SEP>Cognition and objectively measured sleep duration in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis<SEP>Background: Sleep recommendations are widely used to guide communities on children's sleep needs. Following recent adjustments to guidelines by the National Sleep Foundation and the subsequent consensus statement by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, we undertook a systematic literature search to evaluate the current evidence regarding relationships between objectively measured sleep duration and cognitive function in children aged 5 to 13 years. Methods: Cognitive function included measures of memory, attention, processing speed, and intelligence in children aged 5 to 13 years. Keyword searches of 7 databases to December 2016 found 23 meeting inclusion criteria from 137 full articles reviewed, 19 of which were suitable for meta-analysis. Results: A significant effect (r = .06) was found between sleep duration and cognition, suggesting that longer sleep durations were associated with better cognitive functioning. Analyses of different cognitive domains revealed that full/verbal IQ was significantly associated with sleep loss, but memory, fluid IQ, processing speed and attention were not. Comparison of study sleep durations with current sleep recommendations showed that most children studied had sleep durations that were not within the range of recommended sleep. As such, the true effect of sleep loss on cognitive function may be obscured in these samples, as most children were sleep restricted. Conclusions: Future research using more rigorous experimental methodologies is needed to properly elucidate the relationship between sleep duration and cognition in this age group.26584866<SEP>Ninni Persson<SEP>Regional brain shrinkage and change in cognitive performance over two years: The bidirectional influences of the brain and cognitive reserve factors<SEP>We examined relationships between regional brain shrinkage and changes in cognitive performance, while taking into account the influence of chronological age, vascular risk, Apolipoprotein E variant and socioeconomic status. Regional brain volumes and cognitive performance were assessed in 167 healthy adults (age 19-79 at baseline), 90 of whom returned for the follow-up after two years. Brain volumes were measured in six regions of interest (ROIs): lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), prefrontal white matter (PFw), hippocampus (Hc), parahippocampal gyrus (PhG), cerebellar hemispheres (CbH), and primary visual cortex (VC), and cognitive performance was evaluated in three domains: episodic memory (EM), fluid intelligence (Gf), and vocabulary (V). Average volume loss was observed in Hc, PhG and CbH, but reliable individual differences were noted in all examined ROIs. Average positive change was observed in EM and V performance but not in Gf scores, yet only the last evidenced individual differences in change. We observed reciprocal influences among neuroanatomical and cognitive variables. Larger brain volumes at baseline predicted greater individual gains in Gf, but differences in LPFC volume change were in part explained by baseline level of cognitive performance. In one region (PFw), individual change in volume was coupled with change in Gf. Larger initial brain volumes did not predict slower shrinkage. The results underscore the complex role of brain maintenance and cognitive reserve in adult development.29776624<SEP>Michelle A Short<SEP>Cognition and objectively measured sleep duration in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis<SEP>Background: Sleep recommendations are widely used to guide communities on children's sleep needs.

    "answer": "Sleep is a fundamental biological need for humans and is crucial for maintaining overall health, including cognitive and physiological functioning. The research context provided offers several key perspectives regarding the importance of sleep:\n\n1. Cognitive Function and Brain Health:\nAccording to the study conducted by Junyeon Won, poor sleep quality is negatively associated with cognitive performance and brain health in younger adults. The research found that individuals with poorer sleep quality had a lower crystallized intelligence score and a reduced thickness in the entorhinal cortex (EC), which is crucial for memory and navigation. This suggests that sleep quality directly impacts cognitive abilities and the structural integrity of the brain.\n\nThe study by Michelle A Short also notes a correlation between sleep duration and cognitive function in children. Long sleep durations were found to be associated with better cognitive performance, particularly full/verbal IQ. Most of the children in the reviewed studies, however, were not getting the recommended amount of sleep, potentially masking the true impact of sleep loss on cognition.\n\n2. Neuroprotection and Cardiovascular Endurance:\nIn the study by Junyeon Won, it's highlighted that cardiovascular endurance may offer protection against the negative impacts of poor sleep on the brain. It appears to mitigate the relationship between poor sleep quality and lower EC thickness, suggesting that maintaining cardiovascular fitness could help preserve brain health in the context of inadequate sleep.\n\n3. Brain Volume and Cognitive Reserve:\nResearch by Ninni Persson explores the bidirectional influences of brain volume and cognitive performance. While the study does not directly address sleep, it emphasizes the complexity of brain maintenance and cognitive reserve. Given that sleep is fundamental for brain recovery and consolidation processes, quality sleep may indirectly support the preservation of brain volume and cognitive capacity over time.\n\nIn summary, from the information provided, sleep is crucial for health because it:\n\n- Supports cognitive performance and is involved in learning and memory consolidation.\n- Helps to maintain the integrity of brain structures, potentially preventing atrophy and preserving cognitive functions.\n- Interacts with cardiovascular endurance, where a higher level of fitness can have neuroprotective effects against some of the adverse consequences of poor sleep.\n\nIn conclusion, ensuring adequate and quality sleep is essential for maintaining brain health, cognitive function, and overall physiological well-being.",

    "question": "What are the effects of excessive alcohol consumption on the liver?",
    "context": "36407766<SEP>Laura B Ferguson<SEP>RNA biomarkers for alcohol use disorder<SEP>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent and one of the leading causes of disability in the US and around the world. There are some molecular biomarkers of heavy alcohol use and liver damage which can suggest AUD, but these are lacking in sensitivity and specificity. AUD treatment involves psychosocial interventions and medications for managing alcohol withdrawal, assisting in abstinence and reduced drinking (naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram, and some off-label medications), and treating comorbid psychiatric conditions (e.g., depression and anxiety). It has been suggested that various patient groups within the heterogeneous AUD population would respond more favorably to specific treatment approaches. For example, there is some evidence that so-called reward-drinkers respond better to naltrexone than acamprosate. However, there are currently no objective molecular markers to separate patients into optimal treatment groups or any markers of treatment response. Objective molecular biomarkers could aid in AUD diagnosis and patient stratification, which could personalize treatment and improve outcomes through more targeted interventions. Biomarkers of treatment response could also improve AUD management and treatment development. Systems biology considers complex diseases and emergent behaviors as the outcome of interactions and crosstalk between biomolecular networks. A systems approach that uses transcriptomic (or other -omic data, e.g., methylome, proteome, metabolome) can capture genetic and environmental factors associated with AUD and potentially provide sensitive, specific, and objective biomarkers to guide patient stratification, prognosis of treatment response or relapse, and predict optimal treatments. This Review describes and highlights state-of-the-art research on employing transcriptomic data and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to serve as molecular biomarkers with the goal of improving the clinical management of AUD. Considerations about future directions are also discussed.29107202<SEP>Ashley Acheson<SEP>Defining the phenotype of young adults with family histories of alcohol and other substance use disorders: Studies from the family health patterns project<SEP>Individuals with a family history of alcohol and other drug use disorders (FH+) are at increased risk for developing substance use disorders themselves relative to those with no such histories (FH-). Here we sought to identify key characteristics associated with FH+ status and alcohol and other drug use disorder status in a large cohort of FH+ and FH- young adults. We conducted principal component analyses on demographic, temperament, and cognitive measures differentiating 506 FH+ and 528 FH- young adults. Three principal components were identified, and these component scores were then used to predict the odds of being FH+ and the odds of having an alcohol or other drug use disorder. Component 1 consisted of measures indexing internalizing traits, with higher component scores indicating greater depressive, anxious, and emotional instability tendencies. Component 2 consisted of measures of externalizing traits as well as exposure to early life adversity (ELA), with higher scores indicating less impulse control, more antisocial behavior, and greater ELA exposure. Component 3 consisted of estimated intelligence, delay discounting, and demographic characteristics, with higher scores indicating lower estimated intelligence, greater discounting of delayed rewards, less education, and lower childhood socioeconomic status. For each 1-point increase in the Component 1, 2, and 3 scores, the odds of being classified FH+ increased by 2%, 8%, and 4%, respectively. Similar findings were observed when individuals with alcohol or other drug use disorders were removed from the analyses. Finally, greater Component 2 scores were also associated with increased odds of having an alcohol or other drug use disorder. Collectively, these findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the FH+ phenotype in young adults and help form a basis for further studies on biological mechanisms underlying risk for substance use disorders. The present findings also provide further support for a prominent role of ELA in promoting risk for problem alcohol and other drug use.34873973<SEP>Lea Arregui Nordahl Christoffersen<SEP>Demographic factors and delay of treatment for alcohol use disorders among 6584 Danish men receiving alcohol treatment<SEP>Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the time lag between onset and treatment (treatment delay) for alcohol use disorders (AUD) and associations between demographic factors and treatment delay for AUD. Methods: The study included 6,584 men registered in the Copenhagen Alcohol Cohort, containing information on civil status, employment status, estimated age at onset of alcohol problems, and age at first outpatient AUD treatment. Data on year of birth, intelligence, and educational level were obtained from the Danish Conscription Database. Information on first hospital AUD treatment was retrieved from Danish national psychiatric registers. Associations between the demographic factors and treatment delay were analysed in separate linear regression models adjusted for year of birth and in a mutually adjusted model including all demographic factors. Results: The mean treatment delay for AUD was 6.9 years (SD = 4.1). After mutual adjustment, an SD increase in intelligence score was associated with 0.17 years increase in treatment delay. Educational level was unrelated to treatment delay. Men with estimated age at onset of alcohol problems at age 20 years or younger had a 5.30 years longer treatment delay than men who had estimated age at onset of alcohol problems at age 51 years or older. Employed men had shorter treatment delays than unemployed men, especially among the oldest birth cohorts. Conclusions: The treatment delay of 6.9 years highlights the necessity to promote access to AUD treatment, perhaps in particular among adolescents and young individuals. Cognitive factors may affect treatment delay more than non-cognitive personal factors.37408098<SEP>William T Branagan<SEP>Assessment and Evaluation of Alcohol Use Disorder in Liver Transplant<SEP>Alcohol-related liver disease is the most common indication for liver transplantation. It is essential for providers in transplantation to be informed of the state of the science in evaluation of alcohol use disorder (AUD). This review examines the broad range of approaches to the evaluation of AUD ranging from traditional interview approaches to recent literature on artificial intelligence models. The empirical support for methods of evaluation is examined. The authors discuss the use of each method in the context of patients seeking a liver transplant for alcohol-related liver disease. This review emphasizes the importance of using objective assessments so that transplant centers make evidence-based decisions and reduce cognitive bias. The review concludes with a proposed assessment battery for evaluation and bridges to future directions in the field of AUD assessment in liver transplantation.",
    "answer": "Excessive alcohol consumption has a significant impact on liver health. While the provided context does not directly address this question, it offers insight into adjacent areas of research and concern, which I will draw upon to inform the answer.\n\nFrom the context provided:\n\n1. **RNA biomarkers for alcohol use disorder (AUD)** point out that there is a connection between heavy alcohol use and liver damage. While the biomarkers lack sensitivity and specificity, their presence and research underline that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to observable changes at the molecular level.\n\n2. **The family health patterns project** does not speak directly to liver effects but suggests that individuals with a family history of alcohol and other drug use disorders are at an increased risk of developing such disorders themselves, which could, in turn, predispose them to liver complications.\n\n3. **Demographic factors and treatment delay for AUD** indicate a significant gap between the onset of alcohol problems and treatment. This delay can lead to prolonged periods of excessive alcohol consumption, potentially exacerbating liver damage.\n\n4. **Assessment and Evaluation of Alcohol Use Disorder in Liver Transplant** most closely ties excessive alcohol consumption to liver health by stating that alcohol-related liver disease is the most common indication for liver transplantation, which is the end-stage consequence of chronic liver damage.\n\nDrawing from these contexts and established medical knowledge, the effects of excessive alcohol consumption on the liver include:\n\n**Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (Steatosis):** Alcohol can cause fat to build up in the liver. This is often the first stage of liver disease related to alcohol and might be reversible with abstinence.\n\n**Alcoholic Hepatitis:** This is an inflammation of the liver caused by drinking alcohol. It can be mild or severe and can lead to symptoms such as jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain.\n\n**Cirrhosis:** With continued excessive drinking, scarring of the liver can occur. Cirrhosis is often irreversible and can lead to liver failure.\n\n**Hepatocellular Carcinoma:** Long-standing inflammation and cirrhosis may increase the risk of developing liver cancer.\n\nThe Alcohol Use Disorder content touches on psychological and social interventions, which can indirectly help reduce the progression of liver disease by supporting individuals to reduce or abstain from alcohol consumption, thereby lessening the hepatic impact.\n\nIn conclusion, the effects of excessive alcohol consumption on the liver can range from mild reversible conditions to severe, irreversible damage that may necessitate a liver transplant. The research and information provided in the context emphasize the importance of early diagnosis, objective assessment, and timely, personalized treatment to improve outcomes for individuals with AUD, which invariably benefits liver health.",

    "question": "Why are regular medical check-ups essential?",
    "context": "33966519<SEP>Mark V Pezzo<SEP>Effect of Having, but Not Consulting, a Computerized Diagnostic Aid<SEP>Previous research has described physicians' reluctance to use computerized diagnostic aids (CDAs) but has never experimentally examined the effects of not consulting an aid that was readily available. Experiment 1. Participants read about a diagnosis made either by a physician or an auto mechanic (to control for perceived expertise). Half read that a CDA was available but never actually consulted; no mention of a CDA was made for the remaining half. For the physician, failure to consult the CDA had no significant effect on competence ratings for either the positive or negative outcome. For the auto mechanic, failure to consult the CDA actually increased competence ratings following a negative but not a positive outcome. Negligence judgments were greater for the mechanic than for the physician overall. Experiment 2. Using only a negative outcome, we included 2 different reasons for not consulting the aid and provided accuracy information highlighting the superiority of the CDA over the physician. In neither condition was the physician rated lower than when no aid was mentioned. Ratings were lower when the physician did not trust the CDA and, surprisingly, higher when the physician believed he or she already knew what the CDA would say. Finally, consistent with our previous research, ratings were also high when the physician consulted and then followed the advice of a CDA and low when the CDA was consulted but ignored. Individual differences in numeracy did not qualify these results. Implications for the literature on algorithm aversion and clinical practice are discussed.26954243<SEP>Pam McFadden<SEP>Comparison of the Effectiveness of Interactive Didactic Lecture Versus Online Simulation-Based CME Programs Directed at Improving the Diagnostic Capabilities of Primary Care Practitioners<SEP>Introduction: Diagnostic errors in primary care contribute to increased morbidity and mortality, and billions in costs each year. Improvements in the way practicing physicians are taught so as to optimally perform differential diagnosis can increase patient safety and lower the costs of care. This study represents a comparison of the effectiveness of two approaches to CME training directed at improving the primary care practitioner's diagnostic capabilities against seven common and important causes of joint pain. Methods: Using a convenience sampling methodology, one group of primary care practitioners was trained by a traditional live, expert-led, multimedia-based training activity supplemented with interactive practice opportunities and feedback (control group). The second group was trained online with a multimedia-based training activity supplemented with interactive practice opportunities and feedback delivered by an artificial intelligence-driven simulation/tutor (treatment group). Results: Before their respective instructional intervention, there were no significant differences in the diagnostic performance of the two groups against a battery of case vignettes presenting with joint pain. Using the same battery of case vignettes to assess postintervention diagnostic performance, there was a slight but not statistically significant improvement in the control group's diagnostic accuracy (P = .13). The treatment group, however, demonstrated a significant improvement in accuracy (P < .02; Cohen d, effect size = 0.79). Discussion: These data indicate that within the context of a CME activity, a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy can be achieved by the use of a web-delivered, multimedia-based instructional activity supplemented by practice opportunities and feedback delivered by an artificial intelligence-driven simulation/tutor.37495363<SEP>Jakob Thrane Mainz<SEP>Medical AI: is trust really the issue?<SEP>I discuss an influential argument put forward by Hatherley in the Journal of Medical Ethics Drawing on influential philosophical accounts of interpersonal trust, Hatherley claims that medical artificial intelligence is capable of being reliable, but not trustworthy. Furthermore, Hatherley argues that trust generates moral obligations on behalf of the trustee. For instance, when a patient trusts a clinician, it generates certain moral obligations on behalf of the clinician for her to do what she is entrusted to do. I make three objections to Hatherley's claims: (1) At least one philosophical account of interagent trust implies that medical AI is capable of being trustworthy. (2) Even if this account should ultimately be rejected, it does not matter much because what we care mostly about is that medical AI is reliable. (3) It is false that trust in itself generates moral obligations on behalf of the trustee.37423238<SEP>Yves Saint James Aquino<SEP>Making decisions: Bias in artificial intelligence and data\u2011driven diagnostic tools<SEP>Background: Although numerous studies have shown the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in drastically improving clinical practice, there are concerns that these AI systems could replicate existing biases. Objective: This paper provides a brief overview of 'algorithmic bias', which refers to the tendency of some AI systems to perform poorly for disadvantaged or marginalised groups. Discussion: AI relies on data generated, collected, recorded and labelled by humans. If AI systems remain unchecked, whatever biases that exist in the real world that are embedded in data will be incorporated into the AI algorithms. Algorithmic bias can be considered as an extension, if not a new manifestation, of existing social biases, understood as negative attitudes towards or the discriminatory treatment of some groups. In medicine, algorithmic bias can compromise patient safety and risks perpetuating disparities in care and outcome. Thus, clinicians should consider the risk of bias when deploying AI-enabled tools in their practice.",
    "answer": "Regular medical check-ups are essential for maintaining good health for a variety of reasons. By considering the provided context in relation to medical Artificial Intelligence (AI), we can examine how regular medical check-ups, which include timely diagnosis and evaluations, can be improved through technology while also acknowledging potential challenges:\n\n### Early Detection and Prevention\n\n**Traditional Perspective:** Regular check-ups help in the early detection of health issues, which can be easier and less expensive to treat when diagnosed early. They may involve a battery of tests to evaluate health status, screen for diseases, and identify risk factors for future medical problems. \n\n**Contextual AI Perspective:** Studies, including those referenced in the context like the one by Pam McFadden, highlight how AI and computerized diagnostic aids (CDAs) potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of these diagnostics. For instance, in McFadden's study, post-intervention diagnostic performance improved significantly with the aid of AI-driven simulation/tutor.\n\n### Maintenance of Health Records\n\n**Traditional Perspective:** Regular check-ups provide a record of health trends, which are helpful in tracking changes in one's health over time.\n\n**Contextual AI Perspective:** With the aid of AI systems as discussed by Yves Saint James Aquino, data from regular check-ups can be more effectively utilized, enabling pattern recognition and facilitating more informed medical decisions.\n\n### Guidance and Lifestyle Modification\n\n**Traditional Perspective:** Physicians can provide personalized advice and lifestyle modification plans during regular check-ups based on the individual\u2019s health condition and risks.\n\n**Contextual AI Perspective:** AI systems could support practitioners, providing a simulation-based CME as per McFadden's study, enhancing the capability of healthcare providers to offer more nuanced and data-driven lifestyle recommendations.\n\n### Trust in Medical Systems\n\n**Traditional Perspective:** Trust in healthcare providers is essential for effective care, adherence to medical advice, and for the emotional support of patients.\n\n**Contextual AI Perspective:** Jakob Thrane Mainz discusses the issue of trust in relation to medical AI, suggesting that while reliability is critical, the trust that patients place in AI systems and their outputs also plays a significant role in the acceptance and effectiveness of AI in healthcare.\n\n### Bias and Inequality in Healthcare\n\n**Traditional Perspective:** Healthcare professionals strive to provide equitable care to all patients regardless of background.\n\n**Contextual AI Perspective:** Aquino's work brings attention to the concern of algorithmic bias in AI systems, which if unaddressed, can lead to disparities in healthcare delivery. Regular check-ups may help identify such biases when outcomes are monitored across diverse populations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nRegular medical check-ups are essential for a multitude of reasons that span disease prevention, health monitoring, and guided lifestyle changes. The context provided suggests that while AI and CDAs offer promising enhancements to patient care and diagnostic accuracy, medical professionals and patients must carefully consider reliability, trust, and potential biases in these systems. The conscientious integration of AI into regular medical practices holds the potential to revolutionize healthcare but requires careful and continuous ethical scrutiny to ensure that it serves to benefit all aspects of patient well-being.",

    "context": "32962608<SEP>Dongsheng Hong<SEP>Improvement in Hypertension Management with Pharmacological and Non- Pharmacological Approaches: Current Perspectives<SEP>Purpose: Improving hypertension management is still one of the biggest challenges in public health worldwide. Existing guidelines do not reach a consensus on the optimal Blood Pressure (BP) target. Therefore, how to effectively manage hypertension based on individual characteristics of patients, combined with the pharmacological and non-pharmacological approach, has become a problem to be urgently considered. Methods: Reports published in PubMed that covered Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Approaches in subjects taking hypertension management were reviewed by the group independently and collectively. Practical recommendations for hypertension management were established by the panel. Results: Pharmacological mechanism, action characteristics, and main adverse reactions varied across different pharmacological agents, and patients with hypertension often require a combination of antihypertensive medications to achieve the target BP range. Non-pharmacological treatment provides an additional effective method for improving therapy adherence and long-term BP control, thus reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and slowing down the progression of the disease. Conclusion: This review summarizes the available literature on the most convincing guideline principles, pharmacological treatment, biotechnology interference, interventional surgical treatment, managing hypertension with technical means of big data, Artificial Intelligence and Behavioral Intervention, as well as providing future directions, for facilitating Current and Developing knowledge into clinical implementation.35379955<SEP>Kazuomi Kario<SEP>Latest hypertension research to inform clinical practice in Asia<SEP>Despite the challenges associated with the coronavirus pandemic, the last 2 years have been active periods for hypertension research and initiatives in Asia. There are new hypertension guidelines from the World Health Organization that can be interpreted and applied locally. This is also the case for data from the latest Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis, which showed that greater reductions in systolic blood pressure (BP) are associated with lower risks of cardiovascular events. The randomized controlled Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive study and the Salt Substitute and Stroke Study provide local data to inform practice. Other initiatives to help reduce high salt intake in Asia are also underway. Both drug-resistant and nocturnal hypertension are appropriate areas of focus in Asia, and there are an increasing number of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options for these conditions. Digital therapeutics to promote uptake and implementation of lifestyle interventions are showing promise, and other digital-based strategies such as telemedicine, wearable BP monitors to detect beat-by-beat BP and artificial intelligence will no doubt become integral parts of future strategies to reduce the burden of hypertension and hypertension-related disease. A number of initiatives from the Hypertension Cardiovascular Outcome Prevention and Evidence in Asia Network and Japanese Society of hypertension are underway, and there is good reason for optimism regarding the ongoing and future management of hypertension in Asia based on these and the active research activities in the region.34812146<SEP>Xuan Xu<SEP>Data mining methodology for response to hypertension symptomology-application to COVID-19-related pharmacovigilance<SEP>Background: Potential therapy and confounding factors including typical co-administered medications, patient's disease states, disease prevalence, patient demographics, medical histories, and reasons for prescribing a drug often are incomplete, conflicting, missing, or uncharacterized in spontaneous adverse drug event (ADE) reporting systems. These missing or incomplete features can affect and limit the application of quantitative methods in pharmacovigilance for meta-analyses of data during randomized clinical trials. Methods: Data from patients with hypertension were retrieved and integrated from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System; 134 antihypertensive drugs out of 1131 drugs were filtered and then evaluated using the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) of the posterior distribution to build ADE-drug profiles with an emphasis on the pulmonary ADEs. Afterward, the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GLASSO) captured drug associations based on pulmonary ADEs by correcting hidden factors and confounder misclassification. Selected drugs were then compared using the Friedman test in drug classes and clusters obtained from GLASSO. Results: Following multiple filtering stages to exclude insignificant and noise-driven reports, we found that drugs from antihypertensives agents, urologicals, and antithrombotic agents (macitentan, bosentan, epoprostenol, selexipag, sildenafil, tadalafil, and beraprost) form a similar class with a significantly higher incidence of pulmonary ADEs. Macitentan and bosentan were associated with 64% and 56% of pulmonary ADEs, respectively. Because these two medications are prescribed in diseases affecting pulmonary function and may be likely to emerge among the highest reported pulmonary ADEs, in fact, they serve to validate the methods utilized here. Conversely, doxazosin and rilmenidine were found to have the least pulmonary ADEs in selected drugs from hypertension patients. Nifedipine and candesartan were also found by signal detection methods to form a drug cluster, shown by several studies an effective combination of these drugs on lowering blood pressure and appeared an improved side effect profile in comparison with single-agent monotherapy. Conclusions: We consider pulmonary ADE profiles in multiple long-standing groups of therapeutics including antihypertensive agents, antithrombotic agents, beta-blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, or agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, in patients with hypertension associated with high risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We found that several individual drugs have significant differences between their drug classes and compared to other drug classes. For instance, macitentan and bosentan from endothelin receptor antagonists show major concern while doxazosin and rilmenidine exhibited the least pulmonary ADEs compared to the outcomes of other drugs. Using techniques in this study, we assessed and confirmed the hypothesis that drugs from the same drug class could have very different pulmonary ADE profiles affecting outcomes in acute respiratory illness.

Design: Systematic review. Data sources: Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria: Studies addressing outcomes related to the use of technologies for hypertension healthcare (all points in the healthcare cascade) in SSA. Methods: Databases were searched from inception to 2 August 2021. Screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were done in duplicate. Data were extracted on study design, setting, technology(s) employed and outcomes. Blood pressure (BP) reduction due to intervention was extracted from a subset of randomised controlled trials. Methodological quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results: 1717 hits were retrieved, 1206 deduplicated studies were screened and 67 full texts were assessed for eligibility. 22 studies were included, all reported on clinical investigations. Two studies were observational, and 20 evaluated technology-based interventions. Outcomes included BP reduction/control, treatment adherence, retention in care, awareness/knowledge of hypertension and completeness of medical records. All studies used mobile technology, three linked with IoT devices. Short Message Service (SMS) was the most popular method of targeting patients (n=6). Moderate BP reduction was achieved in three randomised controlled trials. Patients and healthcare providers reported positive perceptions towards the technologies. No studies using AI were identified. Conclusions: There are a range of successful applications of key enabling technologies in SSA, including BP reduction, increased health knowledge and treatment adherence following targeted mobile technology interventions. There is evidence to support use of mobile technology for hypertension management in SSA. However, current application of technologies is highly heterogeneous and key barriers exist, limiting efficacy and uptake in SSA. More research is needed, addressing objective measures such as BP reduction in robust randomised studies. Prospero registration number: CRD42020223043.",
    "answer": "Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, significantly impacts cardiac health. It is a risk factor for the development of heart diseases such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and left ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement of the heart\u2019s main pumping chamber). Elevated blood pressure puts additional strain on the heart, forcing it to work harder to pump blood, which can weaken the heart over time and lead to poor cardiac function.\n\n**Contextual Review Based on Provided Database Extracts:**\n\n**Dongsheng Hong's Study (32962608):**\nThis study underscores the complexity of managing hypertension and suggests that both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches are essential for effective treatment. Pharmacological treatments vary in mechanism and side effects, often requiring a combination of medications to achieve optimal blood pressure (BP) targets. Meanwhile, non-pharmacological methods are valuable for improving adherence and long-term BP control, thereby reducing cardiovascular risk and slowing disease progression. Thus, effective hypertension management has a direct implication on reducing the adverse impact on cardiac health by lessening the strain on the heart and mitigating the onset of heart-related complications.\n\n**Kazuomi Kario's Research (35379955):**\nThe research by Kazuomi Kario highlights recent advancements in hypertension treatment and management in Asia. Notably, the paper indicates that lowering systolic blood pressure correlates with a decrease in cardiovascular events. This finding is relevant to cardiac health, as it demonstrates that effective control of hypertension is associated with a reduction in heart-related issues. The use of digital therapeutics and other technologies is seen as promising for enhancing lifestyle interventions, which are critical in managing hypertension and thereby promoting better cardiac health outcomes.\n\n**Xuan Xu's Analysis (34812146):**\nXuan Xu\u2019s paper deals with identifying and evaluating antihypertensive drugs and their association with adverse drug events (ADEs), particularly concerning pulmonary responses. This context does not directly address hypertension's impact on cardiac health, but does highlight the importance of understanding the side effect profiles of antihypertensive medications, which play a crucial role in managing hypertension and safeguarding overall cardiovascular health.\n\n**Katy Stokes\u2019 Review (35383086):**\nStokes\u2019 systematic review examines how technology is used to manage hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa. This study found that mobile technology interventions, such as SMS, can contribute to better control of hypertension through improved medication adherence and increased health knowledge. By extension, these improvements in hypertension management can have a positive effect on cardiac health by helping to reduce the strain on the heart caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nUnderstanding the relationship between hypertension and cardiac health is crucial. The collective wisdom from these studies suggests that by utilizing a blend of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, including lifestyle changes and technology-enabled interventions, hypertension can be managed more effectively. This, in turn, leads to better control of blood pressure levels, which reduces the risk and severity of hypertension-induced heart diseases such as heart failure, coronary heart disease, and other cardiovascular complications.",

The recently developed metric for physical activity (PA) tracking called Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) takes into account age, sex, resting and maximum heart rate, and a score of \u2265100 weekly PAI has been shown to reduce the risk of premature CVD death in healthy as well as individuals with known CVD risk factors, regardless of whether or not the current PA recommendations were met. The aim of the present study was to examine if PAI modifies the associations between SB and CVD risk factor (CV-RF) clustering in a large apparently healthy general population cohort (n=29,950, aged \u226520 years). Logistic regression revealed that in those with \u2265100 weekly PAI, the likelihood of CV-RF clustering prevalence associated with prolonged SB was attenuated across age groups. Monitoring weekly PAI-level could be useful to ensure that people perform enough PA to combat SB's deleterious association with CV-RF.37027132<SEP>Glenn Bean<SEP>Using Personal Activity Intelligence With Patients in a Clinic Setting: A Feasibility Study<SEP>Background: Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is a novel heart-rate-based metric used to assess cardiorespiratory fitness and quantify physical activity. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of PAI with patients in a clinic setting. Methods: Patients (n = 25) from 2 clinics underwent 12 weeks of heart-rate-monitored physical activity interfaced with aPAI Health phone app. We used a pre-post design with the Physical Activity Vital Sign and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Feasibility, acceptability, and PAI measures were used to evaluate the objectives. Results: Twenty-two patients (88%) completed the study. There were significant improvements in International Physical Activity Questionnaire metabolic equivalent task minutes per week ( P = .046) and a decrease in sitting hours ( P = .0001). The Physical Activity Vital Sign activity increase in minutes per week was not significant ( P = .214). Patients achieved a mean PAI score of 116 \u00b1 81.1 and 100 or greater 71% of the days. Most patients (81%) expressed satisfaction with PAI. Conclusions: Personal Activity Intelligence is feasible, acceptable, and effective when used with patients in a clinic setting.38048008<SEP>Zulqarnain Javed<SEP>Polysocial Risk Scores: Implications for Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment and Management<SEP>Purpose of review: To review current evidence, discuss key knowledge gaps and identify opportunities for development, validation and application of polysocial risk scores (pSRS) for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction and population cardiovascular health management. Recent findings: Limited existing evidence suggests that pSRS are promising tools to capture cumulative social determinants of health (SDOH) burden and improve CVD risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors. However, available tools lack generalizability, are cross-sectional in nature or do not assess social risk holistically across SDOH domains. Available SDOH and clinical risk factor data in large population-based databases are under-utilized for pSRS development. Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence present unprecedented opportunities for SDOH integration and assessment in real-world data, with implications for pSRS development and validation for both clinical and healthcare utilization outcomes. pSRS presents unique opportunities to potentially improve traditional \"clinical\" models of CVD risk prediction. Future efforts should focus on fully utilizing available SDOH data in large epidemiological databases, testing pSRS efficacy in diverse population subgroups, and integrating pSRS into real-world clinical decision support systems to inform clinical care and advance cardiovascular health equity.36115148<SEP>Rebecca Wu<SEP>Deterioration Index in Critically Injured Patients: A Feasibility Analysis<SEP>Introduction: Continuous prediction surveillance modeling is an emerging tool giving dynamic insight into conditions with potential mitigation of adverse events (AEs) and failure to rescue. The Epic electronic medical record contains a Deterioration Index (DI) algorithm that generates a prediction score every 15 min using objective data. Previous validation studies show rapid increases in DI score (\u226514) predict a worse prognosis. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the utility of DI scores in the trauma intensive care unit (ICU) population. Methods: A prospective, single-center study of trauma ICU patients in a Level 1 trauma center was conducted during a 3-mo period. Charts were reviewed every 24 h for minimum and maximum DI score, largest score change (\u0394), and AE. Patients were grouped as low risk (\u0394DI",
    "answer": "Given the context provided, if a person ceased regular exercise, several relevant outcomes and perspectives can be considered:\n\n### From the perspective of the Zisko et al. study:\n- Ceasing regular exercise could lead to an increase in sedentary behavior, which is positively associated with a clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n- Without regular exercise, an individual would likely not achieve the recommended score of \u2265100 weekly Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI). This reduction could increase the risk of premature CVD death, even if they don't have existing CVD risk factors.\n- The protective effects of PAI against the negative associations of prolonged sedentary behavior with cardiovascular risk factors would be reduced. This means that stopping exercise could potentially exacerbate the risks associated with a sedentary lifestyle.\n\n### From the perspective of the Bean et al. study:\n- The effectiveness of PAI as a motivational tool in a clinical setting suggests that without regular monitoring of physical activity through such means, patients might experience a decline in their cardiorespiratory fitness.\n- The reductions in sitting hours and increases in physical activity seen in the study could be reversed if regular exercise were to cease, potentially leading to negative health outcomes.\n- The lack of a regular structured physical activity program could result in a decline in metabolic equivalent task minutes per week, which would signify a lower overall level of physical activity.\n\n### From the perspective of the Javed et al. review:\n- Stopping exercise and increased sedentary behavior could negatively influence social determinants of health (SDOH), potentially leading to an increased cumulative burden of these determinants.\n- Given that social determinants play a crucial role in cardiovascular health, the absence of regular exercise might make it harder to manage CVD risk using polysocial risk scores (pSRS).\n- Ceasing regular exercise could diminish the potential benefits gained from integrating SDOH into CVD risk prediction and management.\n\n### From the perspective of the Wu et al. study:\n- Regular exercise is likely a component of a proactive approach to health, which can prevent negative health events or deterioration in various patient populations, such as those in the ICU.\n- Although the study focuses on real-time health monitoring in critical situations, the principles can be extrapolated to general health surveillance, where ceasing exercise could lead to a gradual health deterioration that might not be promptly identified without continuous prediction surveillance.\n\nIn conclusion, stopping regular exercise can lead to increased sedentary behavior, reduction in PAI scores, potential increase in cardiovascular risk factors, and a possible negative impact on broad health determinants that includes both physical and social factors. These changes underscore the holistic importance of maintaining regular physical activity for cardiovascular health and overall well-being.",

A systematic review of the literature was conducted in order to identify relevant longitudinal and cross-sectional studies conducted from 1946 to 2017. A meta-analysis was performed from 24 studies testing the performance of chronic tobacco smokers compared with non-smokers on neuropsychological tests related to eight different neuropsychological domains. The results revealed a cross-sectional association between neuropsychological impairments and chronic tobacco smoking in cognitive impulsivity, non-planning impulsivity, attention, intelligence, short term memory, long term memory, and cognitive flexibility, with the largest effect size being related to cognitive impulsivity (SDM = 0.881, p <0.005), and the smallest effect size being related to intelligence (SDM = 0.164, p < 0.05) according to Cohen's benchmark criteria. No association was found between chronic smoking and motor impulsivity (SDM = 0.105, p = 0.248). Future research is needed to investigate further this association by focusing on better methodologies and alternative methods for nicotine administration.23682867<SEP>Timothy C Durazzo<SEP>Neurocognition in 1-month-abstinent treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent individuals: interactive effects of age and chronic cigarette smoking<SEP>Background: Increasing age and chronic cigarette smoking are independently associated with adverse effects on multiple aspects of neurocognition in those seeking treatment for alcohol use disorders. However, the potential interactive effects of age and cigarette smoking on neurocognition in early abstinent alcohol-dependent individuals (ALC) have not investigated. Methods: Cross-sectional performances of never-smoking healthy comparison participants (nvsCOM; n = 39) and 1-month-abstinent, treatment-seeking, never-smoking (nvsALC; n = 30), former-smoking (fsALC; n = 21), and actively smoking (asALC; n = 68) ALC were compared on a comprehensive neurocognitive battery. Domains of functioning evaluated were cognitive efficiency, executive functions, fine motor skills, general intelligence, learning and memory, processing speed, visuospatial functions and working memory. Participants were between 26 and 71 years of age at the time of assessment. Results: asALC showed steeper age-related effects than nvsCOM on the domains of visuospatial learning, auditory-verbal memory, cognitive efficiency, executive functions, processing speed, and fine motor skills. In pairwise comparisons, fsALC and asALC performed more poorly than both nvsCOM and nvsALC on multiple domains; nvsCOM and nvsALC showed no significant differences. Domain scores for the ALC groups generally fell in the low-to-high-average range of functioning. A clinically significant level of impairment was apparent in only 25% of ALC participants on visuospatial learning, visuospatial memory, and fine motor skills domains. Measures of alcohol use or consumption were not significantly related to neurocognition in the ALC cohorts. Conclusions: The age-related findings suggest that the combination of active chronic smoking and alcohol dependence in this 1-month-abstinent ALC cohort was associated with greater than normal age-related effects in multiple domains. In general, a low level of clinically significant impairment was observed in the alcohol-dependent participants.

    "answer": "Upon examining the context provided from the vector database and considering the relevant literature, quitting smoking would have several beneficial effects on a person's health, particularly in terms of neurocognitive functioning. Based on the systematic review and meta-analysis by A. A. Conti (Reference ID: 30502351), chronic tobacco smoking is associated with neuropsychological impairments across several domains including cognitive impulsivity, attention, intelligence, short term memory, long term memory, and cognitive flexibility. However, the study highlighted no significant association with motor impulsivity.\n\nIn the context of Durazzo's research (Reference IDs: 23682867 presented thrice, which may indicate an input duplication error), the focus was on individuals with alcohol dependence and their neurocognition in relation to chronic cigarette smoking. According to the study, actively smoking alcohol-dependent individuals (asALC) were compared with never-smoking alcohol-dependent individuals (nvsALC) and former-smoking alcohol-dependent individuals (fsALC) on a comprehensive neurocognitive battery. They found that actively smoking alcohol-dependent individuals displayed steeper age-related effects on various neurocognitive domains compared to their non-smoking counterparts. It's important to note that while this study focused on alcohol-dependent individuals, the implications it raises about the interactive effects of smoking and neurocognition are still relevant.\n\nHere are some changes that can typically be expected upon quitting smoking, inferred from the available context and wider health literature:\n\n1. Neurocognitive improvements: As inferred from the studies mentioned, chronic smoking is associated with impairments in several neurocognitive functions, and quitting smoking may help in recovering these functions over time.\n\n2. Reduced cognitive decline: With the cessation of smoking, the steep age-related effects on neurocognition observed in smokers might slow down, leading to potential improvements in areas like visuospatial learning and memory.\n\n3. Lower risk of chronic diseases: Quitting smoking reduces the risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, lung disease, and cancers, particularly those of the lung, mouth, throat, and esophagus.\n\n4. Improved respiratory health: Lung function improves and the decline in lung capacity slows down, which may lead to fewer respiratory symptoms like coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.\n\n5. Circulatory benefits: Within a short period after quitting, blood pressure and heart rate drop to healthier levels, and circulation begins to improve.\n\n6. Enhanced senses: Smoking cessation often leads to a sharper sense of taste and smell.\n\n7. Psychological and emotional benefits: Reducing the neuropsychological impairments associated with chronic smoking may also lead to improvements in mood, reduction in anxiety, and an overall improvement in quality of life.\n\nIt is essential to note that while the benefits of quitting smoking are significant, recovery may be gradual and requires time. Some improvements might be seen relatively quickly, while others, particularly the reversal of cognitive impairments, could take longer and might depend on other factors such as the duration and intensity of smoking history, overall health, and the presence of co-occurring conditions, like alcohol use disorders in Durazzo's study.\n\nThese findings support interventions aimed at smoking cessation to not only improve neurocognitive outcomes but also to contribute to the overall health and well-being of individuals, especially those seeking treatment for alcohol and substance use disorders.",

    "context": "34836203<SEP>Francesco Capozzi<SEP>A Multidisciplinary Perspective of Ultra-Processed Foods and Associated Food Processing Technologies: A View of the Sustainable Road Ahead<SEP>Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are negatively perceived by part of the scientific community, the public, and policymakers alike, to the extent they are sometimes referred to as not \"real food\". Many observational surveys have linked consumption of UPFs to adverse health outcomes. This narrative synthesis and scientific reappraisal of available evidence aims to: (i) critically evaluate UPF-related scientific literature on diet and disease and identify possible research gaps or biases in the interpretation of data; (ii) emphasize the innovative potential of various processing technologies that can lead to modifications of the food matrix with beneficial health effects; (iii) highlight the possible links between processing, sustainability and circular economy through the valorisation of by-products; and (iv) delineate the conceptual parameters of new paradigms in food evaluation and classification systems. Although greater consumption of UPFs has been associated with obesity, unfavorable cardiometabolic risk factor profiles, and increased risk for non-communicable diseases, whether specific food processing techniques leading to ultra-processed formulations are responsible for the observed links between UPFs and various health outcomes remains elusive and far from being understood. Evolving technologies can be used in the context of sustainable valorisation of food processing by-products to create novel, low-cost UPFs with improved nutritional value and health potential. New paradigms of food evaluation and assessment should be funded and developed on several novel pillars-enginomics, signalling, and precision nutrition-taking advantage of available digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Research is needed to generate required scientific knowledge to either expand the current or create new food evaluation and classification systems, incorporating processing aspects that may have a significant impact on health and wellness, together with factors related to the personalization of foods and diets, while not neglecting recycling and sustainability aspects. The complexity and the predicted immense size of these tasks calls for open innovation mentality and a new mindset promoting multidisciplinary collaborations and partnerships between academia and industry.33016094<SEP>Jianping Qian<SEP>Traceability in food processing: problems, methods, and performance evaluations-a review<SEP>Processed food has become an indispensable part of the human food chain. It provides rich nutrition for human health and satisfies various other requirements for food consumption. However, establishing traceability systems for processed food faces a different set of challenges compared to primary agro-food, because of the variety of raw materials, batch mixing, and resource transformation. In this paper, progress in the traceability of processed food is reviewed. Based on an analysis of the food supply chain and processing stage, the problem of traceability in food processing results from the transformations that the resources go through. Methods to implement traceability in food processing, including physical separation in different lots, defining and associating batches, isotope analysis and DNA tracking, statistical data models, internal traceability system development, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain-based approaches are summarized. Traceability is evaluated based on recall effects, TRUs (traceable resource units), and comprehensive granularity. Different methods have different advantages and disadvantages. The combined application of different methods should consider the specific application scenarios in food processing to improve granularity. On the other hand, novel technologies, including batch mixing optimization with AI, quality forecasting with big data, and credible traceability with blockchain, are presented in the context of improving traceability performance in food processing.33348992<SEP>David Julian McClements<SEP>Building a Resilient, Sustainable, and Healthier Food Supply Through Innovation and Technology<SEP>The modern food supply faces many challenges. The global population continues to grow and people are becoming wealthier, so the food production system must respond by creating enough high-quality food to feed everyone with minimal damage to our environment. The number of people suffering or dying from diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, continues to rise, which is partly linked to overconsumption of highly processed foods, especially high-calorie or rapidly digestible foods. After falling for many years, the number of people suffering from starvation or malnutrition is rising, and thishas been exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The highly integrated food supply chains that spread around the world are susceptible to disruptions due to policy changes, economic stresses, and natural disasters, as highlighted by the recent pandemic. In this perspective article, written by members of the Editorial Committee of the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology, we highlight some of the major challenges confronting the modern food supply chain as well as how innovations in policy and technology can be used to address them. Pertinent technological innovations include robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced diagnostics, nanotechnology, biotechnology, gene editing, vertical farming, and soft matter physics. Many of these technologies are already being employed across the food chain by farmers, distributors, manufacturers, and consumers to improve the quality, nutrition, safety, and sustainability of the food supply. These innovations are required to stimulate the development and implementation of new technologies to ensure a more equitable, resilient, and efficient food production system. Where appropriate, these technologies should be carefully tested before widespread implementation so that proper risk-benefit analyses can be carried out. They can then be employed without causing unforeseen adverse consequences. Finally, it is important to actively engage all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain throughout the development and testing of these new technologies to support their adoption if proven safe and effective.35563915<SEP>Sigfredo Fuentes<SEP>Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Food Science, Food Quality, and Consumer Preference Assessment<SEP>In recent years, new and emerging digital technologies applied to food science have been gaining attention and increased interest from researchers and the food/beverage industries [...].",
    "answer": "Consequences of Exclusively Consuming Fast Food\n\nConsuming only fast food may lead to several adverse health outcomes. Fast food is often characterized as ultra-processed food (UPF), which typically contains higher levels of saturated fats, trans fats, sugars, salt, and calories, while being low in nutrients. Extensive consumption of UPFs has been associated with various negative health effects, as highlighted in the provided context from Francesco Capozzi's research on 'A Multidisciplinary Perspective of Ultra-Processed Foods and Associated Food Processing Technologies.'\n\n**Health Concerns:**\n1. **Obesity:** High-calorie content and large portion sizes frequently lead to an excessive calorie intake which can cause weight gain and obesity.\n2. **Cardiometabolic Risk:** There is a strong link between UPF consumption and unfavorable cardiometabolic risk profiles, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance.\n3. **Non-Communicable Diseases:** Increased risk for non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and certain types of cancers.\n4. **Nutrient Deficiency:** Despite being calorically dense, UPFs often lack essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, leading to potential deficiencies.\n   \n**Long-Term Implications:**\nGiven the array of health issues associated with UPFs, a diet comprised solely of fast food significantly raises the risk for chronic illnesses and their associated disabilities, potentially reducing life expectancy.\n\n**Technological Perspective:**\nWhile the current evidence paints a bleak picture, technologies such as those discussed by Jianping Qian on 'Traceability in food processing,' David Julian McClements on 'Building a Resilient, Sustainable, and Healthier Food Supply Through Innovation and Technology,' and Sigfredo Fuentes on 'Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Food Science, Food Quality, and Consumer Preference Assessment,' offer potential advantages. These technologies could help enhance the nutritional quality of UPFs. Evolving food processing technologies and AI applications could result in novel UPF formulations with improved health profiles, providing lower-cost and nutritionally viable alternatives.\n\n**Societal and Environmental Impact:**\nBeyond individual health consequences, excessive UPF consumption may also influence broader societal and environmental concerns. The production of UPFs often involves significant resource use and environmental impact, whereas innovative technologies might offer more sustainable and less wasteful methods for food processing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe adverse health outcomes associated with consuming only fast food underscore the importance of a diverse and balanced diet. While the negative perception of UPFs is warranted due to their link with health complications, technological advancements hold potential for reformulation of these foods to be more nutritious, safer, and environmentally sustainable. Nonetheless, it is crucial that interventions at the individual, policy, and industry levels are aligned to promote healthier food choices and improve the overall food system.",

The present study examined the association of midlife perceived stress with cognitive decline from young adulthood to late midlife, controlling for early life circumstances, education and trait stress (neuroticism). Methods: The sample consisted of 292 members of the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort (1959-1961) with continued participation in two subsequent follow-up studies. Cognitive ability was assessed in young adulthood (mean age 27 years) and midlife (mean age 56 years) using the full Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), and perceived stress was measured at midlife using the Perceived Stress Scale. The association of midlife perceived stress with decline in Verbal, Performance and Full-Scale IQ was assessed in multiple regression models based on Full Information Maximum Likelihood estimation. Results: Over a mean retest interval of 29 years, average decline in IQ score was 2.42 (SD 7.98) in Verbal IQ and 8.87 (SD 9.37) in Performance IQ. Mean decline in Full-scale IQ was 5.63 (SD 7.48), with a retest correlation of 0.83. Controlling for parental socio-economic position, education and young adult IQ, higher perceived stress at midlife was significantly associated with greater decline in Verbal (\u03b2 = - 0.012), Performance (\u03b2 = - 0.025), and Full-scale IQ (\u03b2 = - 0.021), all p < .05. Across IQ scales, additionally controlling for neuroticism in young adulthood and change in neuroticism had only minor effects on the association of midlife perceived stress with decline. Conclusions: Despite very high retest correlations, decline was observed on all WAIS IQ scales. In fully adjusted models, higher midlife perceived stress was associated with greater decline on all scales, indicating a negative association of stress with cognitive ability. The association was strongest for Performance and Full-scale IQ, perhaps reflecting the greater decline on these IQ scales compared to Verbal IQ.36945257<SEP>Laila Ketvel<SEP>Stress-Related Exhaustion, Polygenic Cognitive Potential, and Cognitive Test Performance - A General Population Study<SEP>Background: We investigated whether stress-related exhaustion (chronic or short-term, and co-occurring with depression or not) is related to cognitive performance and whether polygenic cognitive potential modifies these associations. Methods: The participants were from the Young Finns Study (N = 541-1273). Stress-related exhaustion was assessed using the Maastricht Questionnaire, depressive symptoms with the Beck Depression Inventory, and cognitive performance with subtests of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, measuring visuospatial learning, reaction time, sustained attention, and executive function. Cognitive performance and depression were assessed in 2011, and exhaustion in 2001, 2007, and 2011. A polygenic score for cognitive potential was calculated based on a GWAS on intelligence. Results: High stress-related exhaustion, especially chronic, was associated with slower reaction time. Only clinical levels of depression were related to slower reaction time. Polygenic cognitive potential did not modify these associations. There were no differences in cognitive performance between individuals with co-occurring exhaustion and depression vs. those with only either condition. Conclusion: Stress-related exhaustion, especially if chronic, seems to relate to slower reactions. Co-occurring exhaustion and depression may not have additive effects on cognitive performance. High polygenic cognitive potential may not protect from or predispose to harmful effects of exhaustion or depression on reaction time.

This study evaluated the effects of age, BM, and CR on longitudinal changes over 2 visits, 5 years apart, in 3 cognitive abilities that capture most of age-related variability. Methods: Participants included 254 healthy adults aged 20-80 years at recruitment. Potential BM was estimated using whole-brain cortical thickness and white matter mean diffusivity at both visits. Education and intelligence quotient (IQ; estimated with American National Adult Reading Test) were tested as moderating factors for cognitive changes in the 3 cognitive abilities. Results: Consistent with BM-after accounting for age, sex, and baseline performance-individual differences in the preservation of mean diffusivity and cortical thickness were independently associated with relative preservation in the 3 abilities. Consistent with CR-after accounting for age, sex, baseline performance, and structural brain changes-higher IQ, but not education, was associated with reduced 5-year decline in reasoning (\u03b2 = 0.387, p = .002), and education was associated with reduced decline in speed (\u03b2 = 0.237, p = .039). Discussion: These results demonstrate that both CR and BM can moderate cognitive changes in healthy aging and that the 2 mechanisms can make differential contributions to preserved cognition.28402464<SEP>Philipp Hessel<SEP>Economic Downturns, Retirement and Long-Term Cognitive Function Among Older Americans<SEP>Objective: Workers approaching retirement may be particularly vulnerable to economic downturns. This study assesses whether exposure to economic downturns around retirement age leads to poorer cognitive function in later life. Method: Longitudinal data for 13,577 individuals in the Health and Retirement Study were linked to unemployment rates in state of residence. Random- and fixed-effect models were used to examine whether downturns at 55-64 years of age were associated with cognitive functioning levels and decline at \u226565 years, measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised. Results: Longer exposure to downturns at 55-64 years of age was associated with lower levels of cognitive function at \u226565 years. Compared to individuals experiencing only up to 1 year in a downturn at 55-64 years of age, individuals experiencing two downturns at these ages had 0.09 point (95% Confidence Interval [CI, -0.17, -0.02]) lower cognitive functioning scores at \u226565 years (3 years: b = -0.17, 95%CI [-0.29, -0.06]; 4 years: b = -0.14, 95%CI [-0.25, -0.02]; \u22655 years: b = -0.22, 95%CI [-0.38, -0.06]). Downturns at 55-64 years of age were not associated with rates of cognitive decline. Discussion: Exposure to downturns around retirement is associated with a long-lasting decline in cognitive function in later life. Policies mitigating the impact of downturns on older workers may help to maintain cognitive function in later life.",
    "answer": "Based on the context provided from the studies in the vector database, chronic stress appears to have a significant negative effect on mental well-being, particularly concerning cognitive functioning. The following points summarize the key findings from the studies provided, which align with the question at hand:\n\n1. The study by Dinne Skj\u00e6rlund Christensen associates midlife perceived stress with cognitive decline measured over a period of three decades. Factors such as parental socio-economic position and education were controlled for in the analysis, which showed that higher levels of perceived stress correlated with more significant declines in Verbal, Performance, and Full-scale IQ. This indicates that chronic stress has the potential to negatively impact cognitive abilities.\n\n2. Laila Ketvel's research on stress-related exhaustion, whether chronic or short-term, shows an association with reduced cognitive performance, specifically in relation to slower reaction times. This study also suggests that high polygenic cognitive potential does not necessarily protect against, nor does it increase the risk for, the effects of exhaustion and depression on cognitive performance. This implies that genetic predisposition for cognitive ability may not mitigate the effects of chronic stress.\n\n3. Yunglin Gazes' study discusses brain maintenance (BM) and cognitive reserve (CR) and their relationships to age-related cognitive decline. While this study isn't about chronic stress per se, it provides insights into factors that could potentially moderate the effects of stress on cognitive function. It suggests that individual differences in maintaining neural resources over time (BM) and the ability to demonstrate better-than-expected cognitive performance despite life-course-related brain changes (CR) can both play roles in moderating cognitive changes due to aging. These concepts may have implications for understanding how chronic stress impacts cognitive decline.\n\n4. Lastly, Philipp Hessel's study links experiencing economic downturns around the age of retirement with lower levels of cognitive function later in life. This study introduces a more socioeconomic perspective and indicates that stress due to external factors such as financial insecurity can also have long-term negative effects on mental well-being and cognitive abilities.\n\nIn summary, chronic stress contributes to declines in cognitive functioning in various domains, and this effect persists despite controlling for factors like socioeconomic background and baseline intelligence. While genetic cognitive potential may not alter this relationship, mechanisms of brain maintenance and cognitive reserve could offer pathways to mitigate cognitive decline due to stress. Furthermore, external economic stresses around the retirement age further reinforce the idea that stress can have a prolonged impact on cognitive function into later life. Therefore, both from individual stress experiences and broader environmental stressors, chronic stress poses a significant risk to mental well-being, particularly concerning cognitive health.",

    "context": "29931335<SEP>Brian J Curtis<SEP>Objective cognitive functioning in self-reported habitual short sleepers not reporting daytime dysfunction: examination of impulsivity via delay discounting<SEP>Study objectives: (1) Examine performance on an objective measure of reward-related cognitive impulsivity (delay discounting) among self-reported habitual short sleepers and medium (i.e. recommended 7-9 hours) length sleepers either reporting or not reporting daytime dysfunction; (2) Inform the debate regarding what type and duration of short sleep (e.g. 21 to 24 hours of total sleep deprivation, self-reported habitual short sleep duration) meaningfully influences cognitive impulsivity; (3) Compare the predictive utility of sleep duration and perceived dysfunction to other factors previously shown to influence cognitive impulsivity via delay discounting performance (age, income, education, and fluid intelligence). Methods: We analyzed data from 1190 adults from the Human Connectome Project database. Participants were grouped on whether they reported habitual short (\u22646 hours) vs. medium length (7-9 hours) sleep duration and whether they perceived daytime dysfunction using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: All short sleepers exhibited increased delay discounting compared to all medium length sleepers, regardless of perceived dysfunction. Of the variables examined, self-reported sleep duration was the strongest predictor of delay discounting behavior between groups and across all 1190 participants. Conclusions: Individuals who report habitual short sleep are likely to exhibit increased reward-related cognitive impulsivity regardless of perceived sleep-related daytime impairment. Therefore, there is a reason to suspect that these individuals exhibit more daytime dysfunction, in the form of reward-related cognitive impulsivity, than they may assume. Current findings suggest that assessment of sleep duration over the prior month has meaningful predictive utility for human reward-related impulsivity.29776624<SEP>Michelle A Short<SEP>Cognition and objectively measured sleep duration in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis<SEP>Background: Sleep recommendations are widely used to guide communities on children's sleep needs. Following recent adjustments to guidelines by the National Sleep Foundation and the subsequent consensus statement by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, we undertook a systematic literature search to evaluate the current evidence regarding relationships between objectively measured sleep duration and cognitive function in children aged 5 to 13 years. Methods: Cognitive function included measures of memory, attention, processing speed, and intelligence in children aged 5 to 13 years. Keyword searches of 7 databases to December 2016 found 23 meeting inclusion criteria from 137 full articles reviewed, 19 of which were suitable for meta-analysis. Results: A significant effect (r = .06) was found between sleep duration and cognition, suggesting that longer sleep durations were associated with better cognitive functioning. Analyses of different cognitive domains revealed that full/verbal IQ was significantly associated with sleep loss, but memory, fluid IQ, processing speed and attention were not. Comparison of study sleep durations with current sleep recommendations showed that most children studied had sleep durations that were not within the range of recommended sleep. As such, the true effect of sleep loss on cognitive function may be obscured in these samples, as most children were sleep restricted. Conclusions: Future research using more rigorous experimental methodologies is needed to properly elucidate the relationship between sleep duration and cognition in this age group.31642710<SEP>Marcin Zajenkowski<SEP>Why do evening people consider themselves more intelligent than morning individuals? The role of big five, narcissism, and objective cognitive ability<SEP>Morningness-eveningness, or chronotype, reflects the timing of sleep-wake patterns across a 24-hour day. Extant research has revealed that chronotype correlates with numerous psychological constructs including cognitive ability. In the current research, we examined how people with different chronotypes perceive their intelligence. We expected eveningness to be positively associated with subjectively assessed intelligence (SAI) because evening chronotypes demonstrate slightly higher intelligence than morning individuals. Furthermore, we considered personality traits (Big Five and narcissism) and objective intelligence (measured with standardized tests of fluid and verbal IQ) as potential variables that could account for this relationship. Across two studies (N = 504 and 232), we found that eveningness was associated with higher SAI. This relationship remained significant even after controlling for objective intelligence. In Study 1, we also found that when conscientiousness and neuroticism were analyzed together with chronotype, the magnitude of positive association between eveningness and SAI increased. Furthermore, Study 2 revealed that evening individuals exhibited higher narcissism, which fully accounted for their intelligence self-views. In the discussion, we speculate that daily struggles of evening chronotypes to function in morning-oriented society give them a basis to think positively about their intelligence to the extent of positive bias.34782296<SEP>William D S Killgore<SEP>Sleep quality and duration are associated with greater trait emotional intelligence<SEP>Objectives: Prior work suggests that short sleep and total sleep deprivation are associated with reduced trait Emotional Intelligence (trait EI) but not reduced ability Emotional Intelligence (ability EI). To expand this knowledge base, we investigated the role of habitual sleep quality on trait and ability EI above and beyond the known effects of recent sleep duration. Methods: A large sample, comprising 477 healthy adults completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue; trait EI), and Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Scale (MSCEIT; ability EI). Results: Bivariate correlation and multiple linear regression showed that recent sleep duration and PSQI sleep quality each independently predicted higher trait EI scores, including Emotionality, Self-Control, Sociability, and Well-being, but were unrelated to ability EI scores. Conclusions: In this large community sample, recent sleep duration and habitual sleep quality both independently associated with self-perceived dispositional aspects of EI (ie, trait EI). In contrast, recent sleep duration and PSQI score were unrelated to more crystalized aspects of EI performance, which encompass the general fund of emotional information and the ability to understand and reason about emotional concepts (ie, ability EI). In sum, self-reported longer sleep duration and better sleep quality were associated with subjective perceptions of better emotional functioning, but was unrelated to performance-based metrics of emotional reasoning.",
    "answer": "Considering the provided context from various studies, we can explore the question: What would occur if a person consistently lacked sufficient sleep?\n\n**Study 1: Objective Cognitive Functioning in Habitual Short Sleepers (Brian J Curtis)**\n- The study focuses on cognitive impulsivity in individuals with habitual short sleep versus those with recommended sleep duration.\n- A key finding is that habitual short sleepers exhibit increased delay discounting, which reflects higher levels of cognitive impulsivity.\n- This increase occurs regardless of whether the individuals perceive daytime dysfunction.\n- The implication is that even without recognizing it, people who consistently lack sufficient sleep are likely to demonstrate higher impulsivity.\n\n**Study 2: Cognition and Objectively Measured Sleep Duration in Children (Michelle A Short)**\n- Reviews the relationship between sleep duration and various cognitive functions in children.\n- It establishes a correlation between longer sleep durations and better cognitive performance, particularly with full/verbal IQ.\n- The data suggest many children are not meeting recommended sleep durations, which might obscure the actual effect of sleep loss on cognitive function.\n- Under sufficient sleep deprivation, children's cognitive outcomes, including memory and attention, could potentially deteriorate.\n\n**Study 3: Evening People Perceptions of Intelligence (Marcin Zajenkowski)**\n- This research investigates the self-perceived intelligence of individuals with different chronotypes and their personality traits.\n- Evening chronotypes often consider themselves more intelligent and display higher narcissism.\n- Interestingly, the positive association between eveningness and self-assessed intelligence (SAI) persisted even after controlling for actual cognitive ability.\n- This finding adds nuance to the discussion, suggesting that subjective assessments of cognitive performance can be influenced by personal biases unrelated to the actual impairment caused by sleep deprivation.\n\n**Study 4: Sleep Quality and Emotional Intelligence (William D S Killgore)**\n- Highlights the relationship between habitual sleep quality and emotional intelligence (EI).\n- It was found that better sleep quality and longer sleep duration correlate with higher self-perceived trait EI but not with ability EI measured by performance.\n- This suggests that while subjective experiences of emotional functioning may improve with better sleep, the fundamental capacity to understand and process emotions (ability EI) remains unaffected.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nA consistent lack of sufficient sleep would likely lead to various detrimental outcomes across cognitive and emotional domains. These could include:\n- Increased impulsivity and risk-taking behavior.\n- Decreased cognitive functions such as memory, attention, and intelligence, especially in children.\n- Inflated self-assessment of cognitive abilities, irrespective of actual performance, particularly in evening chronotypes.\n- Reduced perception of emotional functioning and well-being, although core emotional reasoning abilities might remain stable.\n\nEach study contributes to a comprehensive understanding that the effect of sleep deprivation can be multifaceted, affecting individuals differently depending on factors such as age, personality traits, and self-perceived impairment. Consequently, consistently lacking sufficient sleep could lead to both objective and subjective consequences that impact daily functioning and overall quality of life.",

    "context": "36968816<SEP>Seyma Handan Akyon<SEP>Artificial intelligence-supported web application design and development for reducing polypharmacy side effects and supporting rational drug use in geriatric patients<SEP>Introduction: The main complications of polypharmacy, which is known as the simultaneous use of more than five drugs, are potentially inappropriate medicines(PIMs), drug-drug, and drug-disease interaction. It is aimed to prepare an auxiliary tool to reduce the complications of polypharmacy and to support rational drug use(RDU), by evaluating the patient with age, drugs, and chronic diseases in this study. Materials and methods: In the first phase of this study, as methodological research, an up-to-date and comprehensive auxiliary tool as a reference method was generated with a database containing interaction information of 430 most commonly used drug agents and chronic diseases in geriatrics in the light of current and valid 6 PIM criteria for geriatric patients, and medication prospectuses, relevant current articles, and guidelines. Then, an artificial intelligence(AI) supported web application was designed and developed to facilitate the practical use of the tool. Afterward, the data of a cross-sectional observational single-center study were used for the rate and time of PIM and drug interaction detection with the web application. The proposed web application is publicly available at https://fastrational.com/. Results: While the PIM coverage rate with the proposed tool was 75.3%, the PIM coverage rate of EU(7)-PIM, US-FORTA, TIME-to-STOPP, Beers 2019, STOPP, Priscus criteria in the web application database respectively(63.5%-19.5%) from the highest to the lowest. The proposed tool includes all PIMs, drug-drug, and drug-disease interaction information detected with other criteria. A general practitioner detects interactions for a patient without the web application in 2278 s on average, while the time with the web application is decreased to 33.8 s on average, and this situation is statistically significant. Discussion: In the literature and this study, the PIM criteria alone are insufficient to include actively used medicines and it shows heterogeneity. In addition, many studies showed that the biggest obstacle to drug regulation in practice is \"time constraints.\" The proposed comprehensive auxiliary tool analyzes age, drugs, and diseases specifically for the patient 60 times faster than the manual method, and it provides quick access to the relevant references, and ultimately supports RDU for the clinician, with the first and only AI-supported web application.37372763<SEP>Amirali Shirazibeheshti<SEP>Automated Detection of Patients at High Risk of Polypharmacy including Anticholinergic and Sedative Medications<SEP>Ensuring that medicines are prescribed safely is fundamental to the role of healthcare professionals who need to be vigilant about the risks associated with drugs and their interactions with other medicines (polypharmacy). One aspect of preventative healthcare is to use artificial intelligence to identify patients at risk using big data analytics. This will improve patient outcomes by enabling pre-emptive changes to medication on the identified cohort before symptoms present. This paper presents a mean-shift clustering technique used to identify groups of patients at the highest risk of polypharmacy. A weighted anticholinergic risk score and a weighted drug interaction risk score were calculated for each of 300,000 patient records registered with a major regional UK-based healthcare provider. The two measures were input into the mean-shift clustering algorithm and this grouped patients into clusters reflecting different levels of polypharmaceutical risk. Firstly, the results showed that, for most of the data, the average scores are not correlated and, secondly, the high risk outliers have high scores for one measure but not for both. These suggest that any systematic recognition of high-risk groups should consider both anticholinergic and drug-drug interaction risks to avoid missing high-risk patients. The technique was implemented in a healthcare management system and easily and automatically identifies groups at risk far faster than the manual inspection of patient records. This is much less labour-intensive for healthcare professionals who can focus their assessment only on patients within the high-risk group(s), enabling more timely clinical interventions where necessary.35840949<SEP>Marat Sultanov<SEP>Investigating feasibility of 2021 WHO protocol for cervical cancer screening in underscreened populations: PREvention and SCReening Innovation Project Toward Elimination of Cervical Cancer (PRESCRIP-TEC)<SEP>Background: High-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing has been recommended by the World Health Organization as the primary screening test in cervical screening programs. The option of self-sampling for this screening method can potentially increase women's participation. Designing screening programs to implement this method among underscreened populations will require contextualized evidence. Methods: PREvention and SCReening Innovation Project Toward Elimination of Cervical Cancer (PRESCRIP-TEC) will use a multi-method approach to investigate the feasibility of implementing a cervical cancer screening strategy with hrHPV self-testing as the primary screening test in Bangladesh, India, Slovak Republic and Uganda. The primary outcomes of study include uptake and coverage of the screening program and adherence to follow-up. These outcomes will be evaluated through a pre-post quasi-experimental study design. Secondary objectives of the study include the analysis of client-related factors and health system factors related to cervical cancer screening, a validation study of an artificial intelligence decision support system and an economic evaluation of the screening strategy. Discussion: PRESCRIP-TEC aims to provide evidence regarding hrHPV self-testing and the World Health Organization's recommendations for cervical cancer screening in a variety of settings, targeting vulnerable groups. The main quantitative findings of the project related to the impact on uptake and coverage of screening will be complemented by qualitative analyses of various determinants of successful implementation of screening. The study will also provide decision-makers with insights into economic aspects of implementing hrHPV self-testing, as well as evaluate the feasibility of using artificial intelligence for task-shifting in visual inspection with acetic acid.

Registered 10 February 2022.37902825<SEP>Smrithi Vijayakumar<SEP>Physicians' Perspectives on AI in Clinical Decision Support Systems: Interview Study of the CURATE.AI Personalized Dose Optimization Platform<SEP>Background: Physicians play a key role in integrating new clinical technology into care practices through user feedback and growth propositions to developers of the technology. As physicians are stakeholders involved through the technology iteration process, understanding their roles as users can provide nuanced insights into the workings of these technologies that are being explored. Therefore, understanding physicians' perceptions can be critical toward clinical validation, implementation, and downstream adoption. Given the increasing prevalence of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs), there remains a need to gain an in-depth understanding of physicians' perceptions and expectations toward their downstream implementation. This paper explores physicians' perceptions of integrating CURATE.AI, a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based and clinical stage personalized dosing CDSSs, into clinical practice. Objective: This study aims to understand physicians' perspectives of integrating CURATE.AI for clinical work and to gather insights on considerations of the implementation of AI-based CDSS tools. Methods: A total of 12 participants completed semistructured interviews examining their knowledge, experience, attitudes, risks, and future course of the personalized combination therapy dosing platform, CURATE.AI. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded manually. The data were thematically analyzed. Results: Overall, 3 broad themes and 9 subthemes were identified through thematic analysis. The themes covered considerations that physicians perceived as significant across various stages of new technology development, including trial, clinical implementation, and mass adoption. Conclusions: The study laid out the various ways physicians interpreted an AI-based personalized dosing CDSS, CURATE.AI, for their clinical practice. The research pointed out that physicians' expectations during the different stages of technology exploration can be nuanced and layered with expectations of implementation that are relevant for technology developers and researchers.",
    "answer": "Based on the context provided from the vector database, it is clear that the primary focus of these entries is on reducing polypharmacy side effects, supporting rational drug use in geriatric patients, and enhancing the safety and efficiency of prescribed medications through the use of artificial intelligence (AI). However, it does not address the direct consequences of suddenly discontinuing prescribed medication.\n\nTherefore, to answer the original question within the established context:\n\n**How would the body react if prescribed medication was suddenly discontinued?**\n\nThe body\u2019s reaction to the sudden discontinuation of medication can vary greatly depending on the type of medication, the condition being treated, and the individual's health profile. Some of the common responses include:\n\n1. **Rebound Effect:** Certain medications, such as antihypertensives, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines, can cause a rebound of the symptoms they were managing. For example, abruptly stopping antihypertensives could lead to an increase in blood pressure higher than before the medication was started.\n\n2. **Withdrawal Symptoms:** Medications that influence neurotransmitter levels, such as opioids and some antidepressants, can lead to withdrawal symptoms when stopped suddenly due to the body\u2019s physical dependence on these substances.\n\n3. **Disease Progression:** In the case of chronic diseases like diabetes or asthma, stopping medication abruptly can lead to worsening of the disease and loss of disease control.\n\nIn the context of the studies cited, AI-supported web applications like the ones developed in the research projects discussed are designed to prevent such outcomes by optimizing medication use. For example, quick detection of drug-drug and drug-disease interactions or the identification of high-risk patients using AI can help in tailoring medication regimens that are safer and more effective. By doing so, they ensure that patients are taking the appropriate medications and that any changes\u2014including discontinuation\u2014are done so in a medically supervised and rational manner to prevent adverse effects.\n\nIt is important to mention though, for specific cases relating to the individual and the medication involved, healthcare providers should always be consulted before making any changes to medication, including discontinuation. The consequences of stopping medication suddenly can be severe and potentially life-threatening, depending on the medication and underlying condition. AI tools and healthcare professionals aim to ensure that medication management is careful and considered to prevent such risks.",

This will inevitably have adverse environmental impacts. These include carbon dioxide emissions linked to the energy required to generate and process large amounts of data; the impact on the material environment (in the form of data centres); the unsustainable extraction of minerals for technological components; and e-waste (discarded electronic appliances) disposal. The growth of Data-Driven and Artificial Intelligence technologies means there is now a compelling need to consider these environmental impacts and develop means to mitigate them. Here, we offer a scoping review of how the environmental impacts of data storage and processing during Data-Driven and Artificial Intelligence health-related research are being discussed in the academic literature. Using the UK as a case study, we also offer a review of policies and initiatives that consider the environmental impacts of data storage and processing during Data-Driven and Artificial Intelligence health-related research in the UK.

We discuss the implications of this and suggest ways that the Data-Driven and Artificial Intelligence health research sector needs to move to become more environmentally sustainable.37783086<SEP>Mojgan Bordbar<SEP>A multi-step approach to evaluate the sustainable use of groundwater resources for human consumption and agriculture<SEP>The rapid decline in both quality and availability of freshwater resources on our planet necessitates their thorough assessment to ensure sustainable usage. The growing demand for water in industrial, agricultural, and domestic sectors poses significant challenges to managing both surface and groundwater resources. This study tests and proposes a hybrid evaluation approach to determine Groundwater Quality Indices (GQIs) for irrigation (IRRI), seawater intrusion (SWI), and potability (POT), finalized to the spatial distribution of groundwater suitability involving water quality indicator along with hydrogeological and socio-economic factors. Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) and Information Gain Ratio (IGR) were used to state the importance of chosen factors such as level of groundwater above the sea, thickness of the aquifer, land cover, distance from coastline, silt soil content, recharge, distance from river and lagoons, depth to water table from ground, distance from agricultural wells, hydraulic conductivity, and lithology for each quality index, separately. The results of both methods showed that recharge is the most important parameter for GQIIRRI and GQIPOT, while the distance from the coastline and the rivers, are the most important for GQISWI. The spatial modelling of GQIIRRI and GQIPOT in the study area has been achieved applying three machine learning (ML) algorithms: the Boosted Regression Tree (BRT), the Random Forest (RF), and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Validation results showed that RF has the highest prediction for GQIIRRI, while the SVM model has the highest prediction for the GQIPOT index. It is worth to mention that the future utilization and testing of new algorithms could produce even better results. Finally, GQIIRRI and GQIPOT were combined and compared using two combine and overlay methods to prepare a hybrid map of multi-GQIs. The results showed that 69% of the study area is suitable for irrigation and potable use, due to both geogenic and anthropogenic activities which contribute to make some water resources unsuitable for either use. Specifically, the northern, western, and eastern portions of the study area are in the \"very high and high quality\" classes while the southern portion shows \"very low and low quality\" classes. In conclusion, the developed map and approach can serve as a practical guide for enhancing groundwater management, identifying suitable areas for various uses and pinpointing regions requiring improved management practices.34585001<SEP>Ugochukwu Ewuzie<SEP>An appraisal of data collection, analysis, and reporting adopted for water quality assessment: A case of Nigeria water quality research<SEP>The appropriate acquisition and processing of water quality data are crucial for water resource management.

    "answer": "**REPERCUSSIONS OF INSUFFICIENT DAILY WATER INTAKE**\n\nIn light of the contextual information provided, which primarily focuses on water quality assessment and sustainable use of water resources from multiple research perspectives, the repercussions of insufficient daily water intake can be considered from several dimensions:\n\n1. **Health Implications**:\n    - **Dehydration**: Insufficient water intake leads to dehydration, a condition that can cause headaches, fatigue, and concentration difficulties. Left unchecked, severe dehydration may result in kidney stones, urinary tract infections, and even renal failure.\n    - **Cognitive Performance**: By keeping the brain adequately hydrated, cognitive functions can be maintained. If water intake is insufficient, a person may experience impaired memory, mood disturbances, and reduced cognitive performance.\n\n2. **Environmental Sustainability**:\n    - **Quality vs. Quantity**: The studies mentioned underscore the importance of data-driven research in water quality assessment. Adequate daily water intake isn't just about quantity but also about quality, as water consumed must be free from contaminants to prevent health issues.\n    - **Resource Management**: Sustainable water resource management is crucial. Insufficient intake may also result from availability issues, which could be exacerbated by environmental factors like climate change. Sustainable management practices can help ensure access to safe drinking water.\n\n3. **Agricultural and Economic Consequences**:\n    - **Food Production**: Insufficient water affects not only human consumption but also agriculture. The demand for quality water in irrigation is essential to sustain crop yields and, by extension, food security.\n    - **Economic Impacts**: Water scarcity can lead to increased costs in sourcing clean water for both drinking and agriculture, creating an economic strain on individuals and communities. Industries also rely on water for production, meaning insufficient supply can affect economic stability.\n\n4. **Data-Driven Decision Making**:\n    - **Assessment and Planning**: The quality of water intake is contingent on effective monitoring and assessment, as highlighted by the provided research. Insufficient water intake may relate to unrecognized pollutants due to inadequate analytical methods, stressing the need for robust data analysis and reporting in water quality studies.\n    - **Policy Development**: The correct interpretation of water quality data supports policy development for environmental and health regulations, contributing to ensuring a sufficient supply of safe drinking water.\n\nTo sum up, insufficient daily water intake has multifaceted repercussions that extend beyond the immediate physiological effects on individuals. It underscores the need for thorough and accurate water quality assessments and sustainable resource management to ensure both the availability and the safety of water for consumption. As such, it relates to broader issues in environmental sustainability, health research, economic impacts, and the importance of leveraging data and AI in approaching these global challenges.\n\nGiven the importance of these factors, it is vital that individuals have access to clean and adequate amounts of water daily, while researchers and decision-makers work together to assess, report, and manage water resources in a way that is informed by accurate data and is environmentally sustainable.",

    "context": "37654007<SEP>Nikolaos G Papadopoulos<SEP>Addressing adverse synergies between chemical and biological pollutants at schools-The 'SynAir-G' hypothesis<SEP>While the number and types of indoor air pollutants is rising, much is suspected but little is known about the impact of their potentially synergistic interactions, upon human health. Gases, particulate matter, organic compounds but also allergens and viruses, fall within the 'pollutant' definition. Distinct populations, such as children and allergy and asthma sufferers are highly susceptible, while a low socioeconomic background is a further susceptibility factor; however, no specific guidance is available. We spend most of our time indoors; for children, the school environment is of paramount importance and potentially amenable to intervention. The interactions between some pollutant classes have been studied. However, a lot is missing with respect to understanding interactions between specific pollutants of different classes in terms of concentrations, timing and sequence, to improve targeting and upgrade standards. SynAir-G is a European Commission-funded project aiming to reveal and quantify synergistic interactions between different pollutants affecting health, from mechanisms to real life, focusing on the school setting. It will develop a comprehensive and responsive multipollutant monitoring system, advance environmentally friendly interventions, and disseminate the generated knowledge to relevant stakeholders in accessible and actionable formats. The aim of this article it to put forward the SynAir-G hypothesis, and describe its background and objectives.26241071<SEP>Elisabet Suades-Gonz\u00e1lez<SEP>Air Pollution and Neuropsychological Development: A Review of the Latest Evidence<SEP>For the last decade, literature on the detrimental impacts of air pollution on brain, cognition and behavior has exponentially increased. Our aim is to review the latest epidemiologic literature on the association between outdoor air pollution and neuropsychological developmental in children. Two independent researchers searched for published studies between January 1, 2012 and June 12, 2015 in MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Science direct using defined keywords on outdoor air pollution and neuropsychological development. Selection of articles was based on study eligibility criteria. We encountered sufficient evidence of detrimental effects of pre- or postnatal exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons on global intelligence quotient. The evidence was also sufficient for the association between pre- or postnatal exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and autism spectrum disorder, and limited evidence was encountered between nitrogen oxides and autism spectrum disorder. For other exposure-outcome associations reviewed, the evidence was inadequate or insufficient. Although evidence is not yet conclusive and further research is needed, the latest epidemiological studies support the hypothesis that pre- or postnatal exposure to ambient pollution, particularly polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PM2.5, and nitrogen oxides has a negative impact on the neuropsychological development of children. The public health impact of air pollutants cannot be ignored and the precautionary principle should be applied to protect children.37187629<SEP>Heba M Adly<SEP>Evaluation of School-Age Children's Intelligence Quotient and Their Chronic Exposure to Trace Elements in Ambient Air<SEP>Background Children's exposure to different trace elements in their air, water, and food or even present in paints or toys can affect their intelligence quotient (IQ) score. However, this correlation needs to be analyzed and evaluated in different contexts. This study aimed to investigate the associations between airborne concentrations of lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), and arsenic (As) and intellectual function in school-age children in Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Methodology Our cohort study aimed to explore the link between exposure to various trace elements in the surrounding air and the IQ scores of children residing in the vicinity of Makkah. We included 430 children in the study and collected information about demographic and lifestyle factors using a structured questionnaire. We employed a mini volume sampler (MiniVol, AirMetrics, Springfield, OR, USA) to collect 24-hour PM10 samples from five locations in Makkah, representing various residential areas with small-to-medium industrial activities and traffic load. We analyzed the samples for Pb, Mn, Cd, Cr, and As concentrations using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry with Perkin Elmer 7300 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The combined impact of heavy metals on continuous outcomes was assessed using the Bayesian kernel machine regression model. Results The mean atmospheric concentrations of Pb, Mn, Cd, Cr, and As in summer were 0.093, 0.006, 0.36, 0.15, and 0.017 \u00b5g/m3, respectively, while in winter, they were 0.004, 0.003, 0.12, 0.006, and 0.01 \u00b5g/m3, respectively. The findings of our study revealed that children's IQ scores were independently associated with co-exposure to the five metals, namely, Pb, Mn, Cd, Cr, and As. Conclusions This study demonstrates a link between combined exposure to five heavy metals (Pb, Mn, Cd, Cr, and As) and children's IQ scores. Regularly evaluating trace elements in children's biological samples is crucial to comprehend their effects on cognitive growth. To explore the possible future health risks of multimetal exposures and their interaction effects, it is imperative to conduct additional studies that involve repeated biological measurements of metal concentrations.36482402<SEP>Lia Chatzidiakou<SEP>Automated classification of time-activity-location patterns for improved estimation of personal exposure to air pollution<SEP>Background: Air pollution epidemiology has primarily relied on measurements from fixed outdoor air quality monitoring stations to derive population-scale exposure. Characterisation of individual time-activity-location patterns is critical for accurate estimations of personal exposure and dose because pollutant concentrations and inhalation rates vary significantly by location and activity. Methods: We developed and evaluated an automated model to classify major exposure-related microenvironments (home, work, other static, in-transit) and separated them into indoor and outdoor locations, sleeping activity and five modes of transport (walking, cycling, car, bus, metro/train) with multidisciplinary methods from the fields of movement ecology and artificial intelligence. As input parameters, we used GPS coordinates, accelerometry, and noise, collected at 1 min intervals with a validated Personal Air quality Monitor (PAM) carried by 35 volunteers for one week each. The model classifications were then evaluated against manual time-activity logs kept by participants. Results: Overall, the model performed reliably in classifying home, work, and other indoor microenvironments (F1-score>0.70) but only moderately well for sleeping and visits to outdoor microenvironments (F1-score=0.57 and 0.3 respectively). Random forest approaches performed very well in classifying modes of transport (F1-score>0.91). We found that the performance of the automated methods significantly surpassed those of manual logs. Conclusions: Automated models for time-activity classification can markedly improve exposure metrics. Such models can be developed in many programming languages, and if well formulated can have general applicability in large-scale health studies, providing a comprehensive picture of environmental health risks during daily life with readily gathered parameters from smartphone technologies.",
    "answer": "**Residing in a heavily polluted area can significantly affect health, according to various studies and research projects as highlighted by the context provided.**\n\n### **Impact on School Children's Health and Development:**\nAccording to Nikolaos G Papadopoulos's research within the \"SynAir-G\" project, the indoor environment, such as schools, which are of crucial interest due to the amount of time children spend there, may contain a mix of pollutants. These pollutants include gases, particulate matter, and biological contaminants like allergens and viruses. Children and individuals with conditions such as allergies and asthma, especially from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, are particularly vulnerable. The SynAir-G project seeks to understand the synergistic effects of different classes of pollutants to improve standards and interventions.\n\n### **Neuropsychological Development Concerns:**\nElisabet Suades-Gonz\u00e1lez provides a review indicating a substantial body of evidence pointing to the harmful impact of air pollution on children's neuropsychological development. Exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have been associated with a decrease in global intelligence quotient and a higher risk of autism spectrum disorder. Nitrogen oxides may also be linked to autism spectrum disorder, though evidence is less conclusive. This suggests that airborne pollutants have the potential to affect cognitive growth and behavior in children.\n\n### **Association Between Airborne Trace Elements and IQ:**\nHeba M Adly's study highlights a direct association between exposure to trace elements like lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), and arsenic (As) in ambient air and children's intelligence quotient. The study found that higher exposure to these metals in the air was independently associated with lower IQ scores in children. This demonstrates the potential damage to cognitive development due to chronic exposure to these substances.\n\n### **Personal Exposure to Pollution and the Role of Activity Patterns:**\nLia Chatzidiakou's work on exposure to air pollution suggests the importance of characterizing individual activity patterns to accurately estimate personal exposure levels. Automated classification of time-activity-location patterns could provide more accurate assessments of personal exposure than relying solely on fixed outdoor air quality monitors. This would be beneficial in comprehensively understanding environmental health risks in daily life, especially with the aid of smartphone technologies.\n\n**In summary**, residing in a heavily polluted area can lead to increased risk of adverse health effects across various aspects of human health, especially in vulnerable populations such as children. There is growing evidence of the negative impact of air pollution on cognitive development, intelligence levels, and the potential for exacerbation of respiratory conditions. This underscores the need for continued research and intervention efforts to mitigate the health risks associated with air pollution.",

    "question": "What would happen if the recommended vaccination schedule was not followed?",
    "context": "35459950<SEP>Ross D Booton<SEP>Modelling the effect of COVID-19 mass vaccination on acute hospital admissions<SEP>Background: Managing high levels of acute COVID-19 bed occupancy can affect the quality of care provided to both affected patients and those requiring other hospital services. Mass vaccination has offered a route to reduce societal restrictions while protecting hospitals from being overwhelmed. Yet, early in the mass vaccination effort, the possible impact on future bed pressures remained subject to considerable uncertainty. Objective: The aim of this study was to model the effect of vaccination on projections of acute and intensive care bed demand within a 1 million resident healthcare system located in South West England. Methods: An age-structured epidemiological model of the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered type was fitted to local data up to the time of the study, in early March 2021. Model parameters and vaccination scenarios were calibrated through a system-wide multidisciplinary working group, comprising public health intelligence specialists, healthcare planners, epidemiologists and academics. Scenarios assumed incremental relaxations to societal restrictions according to the envisaged UK Government timeline, with all restrictions to be removed by 21 June 2021. Results: Achieving 95% vaccine uptake in adults by 31 July 2021 would not avert the third wave in autumn 2021 but would produce a median peak bed requirement \u223c6% (IQR: 1-24%) of that experienced during the second wave (January 2021). A 2-month delay in vaccine rollout would lead to significantly higher peak bed occupancy, at 66% (11-146%) of that of the second wave. If only 75% uptake was achieved (the amount typically associated with vaccination campaigns), then the second wave peak for acute and intensive care beds would be exceeded by 4% and 19%, respectively, an amount which would seriously pressure hospital capacity. Conclusion: Modelling influenced decision-making among senior managers in setting COVID-19 bed capacity levels, as well as highlighting the importance of public health in promoting high vaccine uptake among the population. Forecast accuracy has since been supported by actual data collected following the analysis, with observed peak bed occupancy falling comfortably within the inter-quartile range of modelled projections.38081661<SEP>Abraham George<SEP>Planning for healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Southeast of England: a system dynamics modelling approach<SEP>Objectives: To develop, test, validate and implement a system dynamics model to simulate the pandemic progress and the impact of various interventions on viral spread, healthcare utilisation and demand in secondary care. Design: We adopted the system dynamics model incorporating susceptible, exposed, infection and recovery framework to simulate the progress of the pandemic and how the interventions for the COVID-19 response influence the outcomes with a focus on secondary care. Setting: This study was carried out covering all the local health systems in Southeast of England with a catchment population of six million with a specific focus on Kent and Medway system. Participants: Six local health systems in Southeast of England using Kent and Medway as a case study. Interventions: Short to medium 'what if' scenarios incorporating human behaviour, non-pharmaceutical interventions and medical interventions were tested using the model with regular and continuous feedback of the model results to the local health system leaders for monitoring, planning and rapid response as needed. Main outcome measures: Daily output from the model which included number infected in the population, hospital admissions needing COVID-19 care, occupied general beds, continuous positive airway pressure beds, intensive care beds, hospital discharge pathways and deaths. Results: We successfully implemented a regional series of models based on the local population needs which were used in healthcare planning as part of the pandemic response. Conclusions: In this study, we have demonstrated the utility of system dynamics modelling incorporating local intelligence and collaborative working during the pandemic to respond rapidly and take decisions to protect the population. This led to strengthened cooperation among partners and ensured that the local population healthcare needs were met.37890570<SEP>Donald A Redelmeier<SEP>COVID Vaccine Hesitancy and Long-Term Traffic Risks<SEP>Background: COVID vaccine hesitancy identifies a discrepancy between personal decisions and public guidelines. We tested whether COVID vaccine hesitancy was associated with the long-term risks of a traffic crash. Methods: We conducted a population-based longitudinal cohort analysis of adults by determining COVID vaccination status through linkages to electronic medical records. Traffic crashes requiring emergency medical care were defined by multicenter outcome ascertainment of all hospitals throughout the region over the subsequent year. Results: We identified 11,598,549 total individuals, of whom 1,210,754 had not received a COVID vaccine. A total of 54,558 were subsequently injured in traffic crashes during the 1-year follow-up interval, equal to a risk of 4704 per million. Those who had not received a COVID vaccine had a 58% higher risk than those who had received a COVID vaccine (6983 vs 4438 per million, P < .001). The increased traffic risks among unvaccinated individuals included diverse subgroups, were accentuated for single-vehicle crashes, extended to fatal outcomes, exceeded the risks associated with sleep apnea, and persisted after adjustment for baseline characteristics. The increased risks were validated in analyses using Artificial Intelligence techniques and generally larger than the risks of other adverse events frequently ascribed to COVID vaccination. Conclusions: COVID vaccine hesitancy is associated with significant increased long-term risks of a traffic crash. A greater awareness of traffic risks might encourage patients to take protective actions for personal safety.37919737<SEP>Ritu Chauhan<SEP>The impact of geo-political socio-economic factors on vaccine dissemination trends: a case-study on COVID-19 vaccination strategies<SEP>Background: The world in recent years has seen a pandemic of global scale. To counter the widespread loss of life and severe repercussions, researchers developed vaccinations at a fast pace to immunize the population. While the vaccines were developed and tested through extensive human trials, historically vaccines have been known to evoke mixed sentiments among the generic demographics. In the proposed study, we aim to reveal the impact of political and socio-economic factors on SARS-Cov-2 vaccination trends observed in two hundred and seventeen countries spread across the six continents. Methods: The study had hypothesized that the citizens who have lower trust in their government would be less inclined towards vaccination programs. To test this hypothesis, vaccination trends of nations under authoritarian rule were compared against democratic nations. Further, the study was synthesized with Cov-2 vaccination data which was sourced from Our World Data repository, which was sampled among 217 countries spread across the 6 continents. The study was analyzed with exploratory data analysis and proposed with relevance and impacting factor that was considered for vaccine dissemination in comparison with the literacy rate of the nations. Another impacting factor the study focused on for the vaccination dissemination trends was the health expenses of different nations. The study has been synthesized on political and socio-economic factors where the features were ardently study in retrospect of varied socio- economic features which may include country wise literacy rate, overall GDP rate, further we substantiated the work to address the political factors which are discussed as the country status of democratic or having other status. Results: The comparison of trends showed that dissemination of SARS-Cov-2 vaccines had been comparable between the two-opposing types of governance. The major impact factor behind the wide acceptance of the SARS-Cov-2 vaccine was the expenditure done by a country on healthcare. These nations used a large number of vaccines to administer to their population and the trends showed positive growth. The overall percentage of vaccine utilized by countries in quantitative terms are Pfizer/BioNTech (17.55%), Sputnik V (7.08%), Sinovac (6.98%), Sinopharm/Beijing (10.04%), Oxford/AstraZeneca (19.56%), CanSino (2.85%), Moderna (12.05%), Covaxin (3.28%), JohnsonandJohnson (10.89%), Sputnik Light (3.07%), Novavax (3.49%). While the nations with the lowest healthcare expenses failed to keep up with the demand and depended on vaccines donated by other countries to protect their population. Conclusions: The analysis revealed strong indicators that the nations which spend more on healthcare were the ones that had the best SARS-Cov-2 vaccination rollout. To further support decision-making in the future, countries should address the trust and sentiment of their citizens towards vaccination. For this, expenses need to be made to develop and promote vaccines and project them as positive health tools.",
    "answer": "Given the complex nature of vaccination schedules and their impact on public health, it's vital to consider the provided context from various studies to understand what could happen if the recommended vaccination schedule were not followed. \n\nBased on the background information provided in the context from Ross D. Booton's study about modeling the effect of COVID-19 mass vaccination on hospital admissions, not adhering to the recommended vaccination schedule could result in significantly higher hospital bed occupancies. For instance, in the scenario mentioned in his study, a 2-month delay in the vaccine rollout led to predictions of a peak bed occupancy at 66% of what was experienced during the second wave of the pandemic. This indicates that deviations from the scheduled vaccination efforts can put a strain on hospital resources and healthcare providers.\n\nIn addition, Abraham George's study on healthcare service planning during the COVID-19 pandemic used system dynamics modeling to demonstrate how various interventions, presumably including timely vaccination, can alter healthcare outcomes. Delayed or inconsistent vaccination schedules can accordingly disrupt the planned responses to the pandemic and could increase the burden on healthcare systems.\n\nIn an interesting correlation found in a study by Donald A. Redelmeier, COVID vaccine hesitancy \u2013 potentially reflecting delays or refusal to follow the vaccination schedule \u2013 was associated with increased long-term risks of traffic crashes. This association suggests that those who deviate from recommended vaccination schedules may also engage in other risk behaviors or face consequences of not being part of a protected community.\n\nRitu Chauhan's work delved into the geopolitics and socio-economics of vaccine dissemination. It implies that adherence to vaccination schedules could be influenced by trust in government, healthcare spending, and other socio-economic factors. If recommendations are not followed, this might reflect and exacerbate disparities in health outcomes across different nations, especially those unable to invest significantly in healthcare.\n\nFrom these various perspectives, it becomes clear that not following the recommended vaccination schedule can lead to a series of interconnected consequences:\n\n1. **Increased stress on healthcare systems**: Hospital bed occupancy may rise, leading to overwhelmed healthcare facilities and compromised quality of care for both COVID-19 patients and those with other health conditions.\n\n2. **Altered impact of interventions**: The timing and coordination of public health interventions are key. Disruptions from schedule anomalies could undermine the intended control of virus spread and hospital service sustainability.\n\n3. **Behavioral and societal consequences**: Vaccine hesitancy and non-compliance may correlate with other risky behaviors, potentially leading to unintended health risks like an increased chance of traffic accidents.\n\n4. **Polarized health outcomes**: Socio-economic and political factors significantly influence vaccination trends. Deviations from schedules could further polarize nations with different capabilities of healthcare spending, impacting the global recovery from the pandemic.\n\nIn conclusion, adherence to the recommended vaccination schedule is critical for individual and public health outcomes, disrupting the schedule can have far-reaching consequences that extend well beyond individual health to impacting societal structures and healthcare systems at large.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of aerobic and resistance training on cognitive ability. Methods: A computerized literature search was carried out using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase SCOPUS, Web of Science, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wanfang, and VIP database to identify relevant articles from inception through to 1 October 2022. Based on a preliminary search of the database and the references cited, 10,338 records were identified. For the measured values of the research results, the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to synthesize the effect size. Results: Finally, 10 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Since the outcome indicators of each literature are different in evaluating the old cognitive ability, a subgroup analysis was performed on the included literature. The study of results suggests that aerobic or resistance training interventions significantly improved cognitive ability in older adults compared with control interventions with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MD 2.76; 95% CI 2.52 to 3.00), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MD 2.64; 95% CI 2.33 to 2.94), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (MD 2.86; 95% CI 2.25 to 3.47), the Wechsler Memory Scale (MD 9.33; 95% CI 7.12 to 11.54), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (MD 5.31; 95% CI 1.20 to 9.43), the Trail Making Tests (MD -8.94; 95% CI -9.81 to -8.07), and the Stroop Color and Word Test (MD -5.20; 95% CI -7.89 to -2.51). Conclusion: Physical exercise improved the cognitive function of the older adults in all mental states. To improve cognitive ability, this meta-analysis recommended that patients perform at least moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and resistance exercise on as many days as possible in the week to comply with current exercise guidelines while providing evidence for clinicians.28293187<SEP>Vina M Goghari<SEP>Comparison of Cognitive Change after Working Memory Training and Logic and Planning Training in Healthy Older Adults<SEP>Recent attention has focused on the benefits of cognitive training in healthy adults. Many commercial cognitive training programs are available given the attraction of not only bettering one's cognitive capacity, but also potentially preventing age-related declines, which is of particular interest to older adults. The issue of whether cognitive training can improve performance within cognitive domains not trained (i.e., far transfer) is controversial, with meta-analyses of cognitive training both supporting and falsifying this claim. More support is present for the near transfer (i.e., transfer in cognitive domain trained) of cognitive training; however, not in all studies. To date, no studies have compared working memory training to training higher-level processes themselves, namely logic and planning. We studied 97 healthy older adults above the age of 65. Healthy older adults completed either an 8-week web-based cognitive training program on working memory or logic and planning. An additional no-training control group completed two assessments 8-weeks apart. Participants were assessed on cognitive measures of near and far transfer, including working memory, planning, reasoning, processing speed, verbal fluency, cognitive flexibility, and creativity. Participants improved on the trained tasks from the first day to last day of training. Bayesian analyses demonstrated no near or far transfer effects after cognitive training. These results support the conclusion that performance-adaptive computerized cognitive training may not enhance cognition in healthy older adults. Our lack of findings could be due to a variety of reasons, including studying a cohort of healthy older adults that were performing near their cognitive ceiling, employing a training protocol that was not sufficient to produce a change, or that no true findings exist. Research suggests numerous study factors that can moderate the results. In addition, the role of psychological variables, such as expectations and motivation to train, are critical in understanding the effects of cognitive training.23936251<SEP>Christiaan G Blankevoort<SEP>Physical predictors of cognitive performance in healthy older adults: a cross-sectional analysis<SEP>There is ample evidence that physical and cognitive performance are related, but the results of studies investigating this relationship show great variability. Both physical performance and cognitive performance are constructs consisting of several subdomains, but it is presently unknown if the relationship between physical and cognitive performance depends on subdomain of either construct and whether gender and age moderate this relationship. The aim of this study is to identify the strongest physical predictors of cognitive performance, to determine the specificity of these predictors for various cognitive subdomains, and to examine gender and age as potential moderators of the relationship between physical and cognitive performance in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. In total, 98 men and 122 women (average age 74.0\u00b15.6 years) were subjected to a series of performance-based physical fitness and neuropsychological tests. Muscle strength, balance, functional reach, and walking ability (combined score of walking speed and endurance) were considered to predict cognitive performance across several domains (i.e. memory, verbal attention, visual attention, set-shifting, visuo-motor attention, inhibition and intelligence). Results showed that muscle strength was a significant predictor of cognitive performance for men and women. Walking ability and balance were significant predictors of cognitive performance for men, whereas only walking ability was significant for women. We did not find a moderating effect of age, nor did we find support for a differential effect of the physical predictors across different cognitive subdomains. In summary, our results showed a significant relationship between cognitive and physical performance, with a moderating effect of gender.22841936<SEP>Jennifer Reijnders<SEP>Cognitive interventions in healthy older adults and people with mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review<SEP>Given that the research area of cognitive intervention studies in the aging population is growing rapidly, it is important to review and gauge more recent intervention studies, in order to determine the evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive interventions. The purpose of the present review was to update the recent systematic reviews of Papp et al. (2009) and Martin et al. (2011), to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive interventions in healthy older adults and people with MCI, by taking into account the methodological quality of the interventions studies. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCT) and clinical studies published between August 2007 and February 2012 in Pubmed and PsychINFO was performed. The quality of the included RCTs was assessed according to the CONSORT criteria for RCTs. A total of thirty-five studies were included; twenty-seven RTCs and eight clinical studies. The content of the intervention studies differed widely, as did the methodological quality of the included RCTs, but was considerably low with an average of 44% of the Consort items included. The results show evidence that cognitive training can be effective in improving various aspects of objective cognitive functioning; memory performance, executive functioning, processing speed, attention, fluid intelligence, and subjective cognitive performance. However, the issue whether the effects of cognitive interventions generalize to improvement in everyday life activities is still unresolved and needs to be addressed more explicitly in future research.",
    "answer": "Given the context provided\u2014a focus on the cognitive effects of physical and cognitive training in older adults\u2014the information doesn't directly address how an untrained body would respond to high-intensity workout. However, tangential insights may help reason about physical responses to such stimuli. Let's synthesize the relevant themes from the provided studies to create an informed response:\n\nLiya Xu's systematic review found that physical exercise improved cognitive function in older adults, suggesting a positive relationship between physical activity and mental health.\n\nVina M. Goghari's research indicated that performance-adaptive computerized cognitive training may not enhance cognition in healthy older adults, which may infer a potential limit to the adaptability of the untrained body or mind.\n\nChristiaan G. Blankevoort's study highlighted that muscle strength, balance, and walking ability are predictive of cognitive performance. Conversely, an untrained body might have lower physical predictors, potentially impacting the cognitive response to exercise.\n\nJennifer Reijnders' systematic review reported that cognitive training can improve various aspects of cognitive function. An untrained body might experience different levels of stress that could affect cognitive and physical function during a high-intensity workout.\n\nConsidering these perspectives, the response to a high-intensity workout in an untrained body may involve several factors:\n1. **Cardiovascular Strain:** The heart and lungs may struggle to meet the increased oxygen demand, leading to rapid fatigue and potentially extreme stress for someone unaccustomed to such workouts.\n2. **Muscular Response:** Muscles may experience acute soreness, fatigue, and greater risk of injury due to the absence of conditioning.\n3. **Metabolic Impact:** Metabolic byproducts like lactic acid would accumulate more quickly, possibly leading to cramping and discomfort.\n4. **Cognitive Overload:** As high-intensity workouts can be mentally taxing, an untrained individual might find the workout overwhelming, leading to decreased performance or cessation of exercise.\n5. **Post-Exercise Recovery:** Recovery likely would be slower for an untrained individual compared to a trained athlete, with increased soreness and higher risk of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).\n\nWhile high-intensity workouts can improve cognitive function over time, as suggested by the systematic review by Xu, starting such a regimen without prior training could pose risks. It's essential for individuals, particularly older adults, to gradually build up their fitness level under medical and fitness professional guidance to avoid potential negative outcomes.",

In addition, elevated glucose may also presage other morbidities, particularly for those who show progressive deterioration in glucose control over time. This concept of the glucose trajectory has taken on recent significance with sophisticated mathematical modeling that can identify several different arcs, primarily based on longitudinal changes in fasting plasma glucose. Other trajectories, calculated on changes in glycated hemoglobin, or integrated responses to oral glucose tolerance tests, are less well characterized. The author has reviewed the literature in an attempt to clarify these different themes of age-related deterioration in glucose control, highlight conflicting definitions of glucose trajectory, and potentially identify avenues of further investigation. Genetic contributions to the risk of development of type 2 diabetes, artificial intelligence and mathematical models of diabetes risk, and the discrepancy between fasting glucose and postprandial measures, including glycated hemoglobin, in risk prediction are also considered.28734164<SEP>Aaron L Gardony<SEP>Cognitive strategies in the mental rotation task revealed by EEG spectral power<SEP>The classic mental rotation task (MRT; Shepard & Metzler, 1971) is commonly thought to measure mental rotation, a cognitive process involving covert simulation of motor rotation. Yet much research suggests that the MRT recruits both motor simulation and other analytic cognitive strategies that depend on visuospatial representation and visual working memory (WM). In the present study, we investigated cognitive strategies in the MRT using time-frequency analysis of EEG and independent component analysis. We scrutinized sensorimotor mu (\u00b5) power reduction, associated with motor simulation, parietal alpha (p\u03b1) power reduction, associated with visuospatial representation, and frontal midline theta (fm\u03b8) power enhancement, associated with WM maintenance and manipulation. \u00b5 power increased concomitant with increasing task difficulty, suggesting reduced use of motor simulation, while p\u03b1 decreased and fm\u03b8 power increased, suggesting heightened use of visuospatial representation processing and WM, respectively. These findings suggest that MRT performance involves flexibly trading off between cognitive strategies, namely a motor simulation-based mental rotation strategy and WM-intensive analytic strategies based on task difficulty. Flexible cognitive strategy use may be a domain-general cognitive principle that underlies aptitude and spatial intelligence in a variety of cognitive domains. We close with discussion of the present study's implications as well as future directions.37918637<SEP>Rozalina G McCoy<SEP>Longitudinal trajectories of glycemic control among U.S. Adults with newly diagnosed diabetes<SEP>Aims: To identify longitudinal trajectories of glycemic control among adults with newly diagnosed diabetes, overall and by diabetes type. Methods: We analyzed claims data from OptumLabs\u00ae Data Warehouse for 119,952 adults newly diagnosed diabetes between 2005 and 2018. We applied a novel Mixed Effects Machine Learning model to identify longitudinal trajectories of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) over 3 years of follow-up and used multinomial regression to characterize factors associated with each trajectory. Results: The study population was comprised of 119,952 adults with newly diagnosed diabetes, including 696 (0.58%) with type 1 diabetes. Among patients with type 1 diabetes, 52.6% were diagnosed at very high HbA1c, partially improved, but never achieved control; 32.5% were diagnosed at low HbA1c and deteriorated over time; and 14.9% had stable low HbA1c. Among patients with type 2 diabetes, 67.7% had stable low HbA1c, 14.4% were diagnosed at very high HbA1c, partially improved, but never achieved control; 10.0% were diagnosed at moderately high HbA1c and deteriorated over time; and 4.9% were diagnosed at moderately high HbA1c and improved over time. Conclusions: Claims data identified distinct longitudinal trajectories of HbA1c after diabetes diagnosis, which can be used to anticipate challenges and individualize care plans to improve glycemic control.37918637<SEP>Rozalina G McCoy<SEP>Longitudinal trajectories of glycemic control among U.S. Adults with newly diagnosed diabetes<SEP>Aims: To identify longitudinal trajectories of glycemic control among adults with newly diagnosed diabetes, overall and by diabetes type.

    "answer": "Considering the provided context, the contribution of sedentary living and a high-sugar diet to the development of type 2 diabetes can be discussed from several perspectives:\n\n1. **Deterioration of Glucose Tolerance with Age**: With age, there\u2019s a natural decline in glucose tolerance. However, in individuals leading a sedentary lifestyle and consuming a high-sugar diet, this deterioration can be exacerbated. These behaviors can speed up the decline in the body's ability to regulate blood sugar levels, thereby increasing the risk for type 2 diabetes.\n\n2. **Glucose Trajectory and Mathematical Modeling**: Mathematical models, like those mentioned in the context from Swislocki (35426740), analyze longitudinal changes in metabolic markers such as fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Sedentary living and high-sugar diets can influence these trajectories, leading to a higher likelihood of developing a trajectory that is associated with the onset of diabetes.\n\n3. **Genetic Contributions and Lifestyle Factors**: Although genetic predisposition plays a role, lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity level are critical. An unhealthy diet high in sugar and lack of physical activity can contribute to weight gain and insulin resistance, both of which are significant risk factors for type 2 diabetes, even for those with a genetic predisposition.\n\n4. **Longitudinal Trajectories of Glycemic Control**: In the context provided by Rozalina G McCoy (37918637), understanding the trajectories of HbA1c levels post-diabetes diagnosis can provide insight. Sedentary living and a high-sugar diet are likely to contribute to more adverse trajectories, characterized by higher initial HbA1c levels that either remain constant or deteriorate over time, as opposed to improving or maintaining control.\n\nTo summarize, both sedentary living and a high-sugar diet contribute significantly to the development of type 2 diabetes by worsening glucose tolerance, contributing to unfavorable glucose trajectories, and exacerbating the effects of genetic risk factors. They provoke weight gain and create an environment in the body that is conducive to insulin resistance, leading to poor glycemic control over time. It is evident from the claims data and the research mentioned that individualized care plans that address these aspects are essential in managing and potentially preventing type 2 diabetes.",

    "context": "30660750<SEP>Karen Spruyt<SEP>A review of developmental consequences of poor sleep in childhood<SEP>Sleep is a fairly diverse and complex construct to operationalize in a scientific and naturalistic context. We report a systematic review and meta-analysis of reviews published in the last 5 years on poor sleep and developmental outcomes. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 42 articles (or 1117 studies) qualified. They reported outcomes related to poor sleep investigated as sleep disorders (38.1%), sleep 'in general' (26.2%), sleep duration (23.8%), in terms of circadian rhythm (4.8%), intra-individual variability (2.4%), and napping (2.4%). Sleep was primarily subjectively reported (30.2%), yet the methodology of sleep assessment was often neither tabulated nor discussed. Overall, most papers had a health-scope, being primarily weight problems expressed as body mass index. Its relationship with performance was measured with the Wechsler intelligence tests, the child behavior checklist and the continuous performance test, whereas meta-analytic papers specifically focused on cognition with sleep disorder (i.e. sleep-disordered breathing; 38.6%), on health (i.e. weight) with sleep duration (25%) and behavior with sleep 'in general' (15.9%), having a high true variance. Nevertheless, an aggregated effect size d of 0.35 (95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.42) suggests that poor sleep is moderately affecting a child's performance and health. In conclusion, poor sleep can no longer be disregarded, yet methodologies that are more rigorous and a scope beyond health may foster a better understanding of the role of (poor) sleep across childhood neurodevelopment.26803843<SEP>Desana Kocevska<SEP>Early Childhood Sleep Patterns and Cognitive Development at Age 6 Years: The Generation R Study<SEP>Objective: To explore the association of sleep duration and awakening frequency with cognitive outcomes in young children. Methods: Mothers of 2,800 children from the Generation R cohort reported sleep duration and awakenings at children's age 24 months. At age 6 years, validated Dutch measures were used to assess children's nonverbal intelligence and language comprehension. Results: We found a nonlinear association of total sleep time at 24 months with nonverbal intelligence ( p = 0.03) and language comprehension ( p = 0.04) at 6 years. Toddlers sleeping within the recommended 11-14 hr had more favorable cognitive development compared with both extremes. Frequent awakenings were negatively associated with nonverbal intelligence, but not with verbal comprehension. Conclusion: Sleep duration in toddlerhood has an inverted-U-shaped relation with childhood cognitive measures. Frequent awakenings are associated with lower nonverbal intelligence. Given the marked decline in sleep duration and awakenings in toddlerhood, developmental changes of sleep patterns might be important for cognitive development.31614622<SEP>Mar\u00eda Del Carmen P\u00e9rez-Fuentes<SEP>Analysis of Sociodemographic and Psychological Variables Involved in Sleep Quality in Nurses<SEP>Background: Sleep quality is related to health and quality of life and can lead to the development of related disorders. This study analyzed the sociodemographic and psychological factors related to sleep quality in nurses. Methods: The sample comprised 1094 nurses who were assessed according to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Rosenberg Self-esteem Questionnaire, the Goal Content for Exercise Questionnaire, the Brief Emotional Intelligence Inventory, and the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R18. Results: The results confirm the impacts of diet, motivation for physical exercise, emotional intelligence, and overall self-esteem on sleep quality in nurses. Conclusions: Sleep quality in healthcare professionals is vitally important for performance at work; therefore, appropriate strategies should be applied to improve it.23372271<SEP>Alex Chatburn<SEP>Sleep spindle activity and cognitive performance in healthy children<SEP>Study objectives: To investigate the association between indices of sleep spindle activity and cognitive performance in a sample of healthy children. Design: Correlational. Intelligence (Stanford-Binet) and neurocognitive functioning (NEPSY) were assessed, with sleep variables being measured during overnight polysomnography. Setting: Hospital sleep laboratory. Participants: Twenty-seven healthy children (mean age 8.19 y; 14 female, 13 male). Interventions: N/A. Measurements and results: Participants underwent a single night of overnight polysomnography after completing measures of intelligence and neurocognitive functioning. Sleep spindles were visually identified by an experienced sleep scoring technician and separated algorithmically into fast (> 13 Hz) and slow spindle (< 13 Hz) categories. The number of fast spindles was significantly correlated with narrative memory (r(s) = 0.38) and sensorimotor functioning (-0.43). Mean central frequency of spindles was also significantly correlated with sensorimotor functioning (-0.41), planning ability (-0.41), and working memory (-0.54). Conclusions: Basal sleep spindle activity is associated with different aspects of cognitive performance in children. To the extent that these associations in a pediatric population are different from what is known in adult sleep may play an important role in development.",
    "answer": "The context provided from these different studies offers various perspectives on the long-term effects of inadequate sleep, primarily focused on childhood development and performance in different populations, such as nurses and children. Combining the insights gained from these sources, we can synthesize an understanding of the potential long-term effects of consistently inadequate sleep:\n\n1. **Developmental Consequences in Childhood** (Context 30660750: Karen Spruyt):\n   Poor sleep during childhood can have moderate effects on a child's performance and health. With studies reporting that sleep disorders, general sleep quality, and sleep duration are connected to outcomes in weight (body mass index), cognitive performance (as assessed by Wechsler intelligence tests, the child behavior checklist, and the continuous performance test), and behavior. Poor sleep is, therefore, an important factor in child neurodevelopment, suggesting that long-term inadequate sleep might lead to sustained impacts on health and cognitive functioning.\n\n2. **Cognitive Development in Early Childhood** (Context 31614622: Desana Kocevska):\n   Childhood sleep patterns have been associated with cognitive development in later childhood. An inverted-U-shaped relationship was found between sleep duration in toddlers and cognitive measures in young children, indicating that both too little and too much sleep can have adverse effects. Frequent awakenings are particularly associated with lower nonverbal intelligence, implying that sleep disturbances can lead to long-term cognitive effects.\n\n3. **Sleep Quality in Nurses** (Context 31614622: Mar\u00eda Del Carmen P\u00e9rez-Fuentes):\n   In adults, specifically nurses, sleep quality was found to be linked with diet, motivation for physical exercise, emotional intelligence, and self-esteem. Poor sleep quality can have profound effects on professional performance and well-being, which could lead to long-term issues in managing the demands of the profession and maintaining a high quality of patient care.\n\n4. **Sleep Spindles and Cognitive Performance** (Context 23372271: Alex Chatburn):\n   Sleep spindle activity, which is a characteristic of non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, is associated with cognitive performance in children, including aspects such as memory and sensorimotor functioning. This association suggests that the quality and characteristics of sleep are linked to cognitive abilities, and disruptions or deficiencies in sleep architecture could have lasting implications for cognitive development.\n\nIn summary, the long-term effects of consistently inadequate sleep can be wide-ranging, impacting various facets of health, performance, and development. Depending on the age group and population, these effects manifest in different cognitive and health-related outcomes. Specifically, in children, inadequate sleep can have developmental consequences that affect cognitive performance, behavior, and health. In nursing professionals, poor sleep quality can be detrimental to job performance and overall well-being. The underlying factor is that high-quality, restorative sleep is essential for proper cognitive development and functioning across all age groups, highlighting the necessity for adequate sleep to maintain long-term health and performance outcomes.",

    "context": "34805226<SEP>Lukas Borcherding<SEP>Impaired Dendritic Cell Homing in COVID-19<SEP>The high mortality of COVID-19 is mostly attributed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), whose histopathological correlate is diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Furthermore, severe COVID-19 is often accompanied by a cytokine storm and a disrupted response of the adaptive immune system. Studies aiming to depict this dysregulation have mostly investigated the peripheral cell count as well as the functionality of immune cells. We investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on antigen-presenting cells using multiplexed immunofluorescence. Similar to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be impairing the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). DC maturation involves a switch in surface antigen expression, which enables the cells' homing to lymph nodes and the subsequent activation of T-cells. As quantitative descriptions of the local inflammatory infiltrate are still scarce, we compared the cell population of professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) in the lungs of COVID-19 autopsy cases in different stages of DAD. We found an increased count of myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) in later stages. Interestingly, mDCs also showed no significant upregulation of maturation markers in DAD-specimens with high viral load. Accumulation of immature mDCs, which are unable to home to lymph nodes, ultimately results in an inadequate T-cell response.36003511<SEP>Xi Chen<SEP>Role of tannic acid against SARS-cov-2 cell entry by targeting the interface region between S-protein-RBD and human ACE2<SEP>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was caused by a new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 utilizes human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the cellular receptor of its spike glycoprotein (SP) to gain entry into cells. Consequently, we focused on the potential of repurposing clinically available drugs to block the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to hACE2 by utilizing a novel artificial-intelligence drug screening approach. Based on the structure of S-RBD and hACE2, the pharmacophore of SARS-CoV-2-receptor-binding-domain (S-RBD) -hACE2 interface was generated and used to screen a library of FDA-approved drugs. A total of 20 drugs were retrieved as S-RBD-hACE2 inhibitors, of which 16 drugs were identified to bind to S-RBD or hACE2. Notably, tannic acid was validated to interfere with the binding of S-RBD to hACE2, thereby inhibited pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 entry. Experiments involving competitive inhibition revealed that tannic acid competes with S-RBD and hACE2, whereas molecular docking proved that tannic acid interacts with the essential residues of S-RBD and hACE2. Based on the known antiviral activity and our findings, tannic acid might serve as a promising candidate for preventing and treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.34667828<SEP>Khaled A Al-Utaibi<SEP>Forecasting the action of CAR-T cells against SARS-corona virus-II infection with branching process<SEP>The CAR-T cells are the genetically engineered T cells, designed to work specifically for the virus antigens (or other antigens, such as tumour specific antigens). The CAR-T cells work as the living drug and thus provides an adoptive immunotherapy strategy. The novel corona virus treatment and control designs are still under clinical trials. One of such techniques is the injection of CAR-T cells to fight against the COVID-19 infection. In this manuscript, the hypothesis is based on the CAR-T cells, that are suitably engineered towards SARS-2 viral antigen, by the N protein. The N protein binds to the SARS-2 viral RNA and is found in abundance in this virus, thus for the engineered cell research, this protein sequence is chosen as a potential target. The use of the sub-population of T-reg cells is also outlined. Mathematical modeling of such complex line of action can help to understand the dynamics. The modeling approach is inspired from the probabilistic rules, including the branching process, the Moran process and kinetic models. The Moran processes are well recognized in the fields of artificial intelligence and data science. The model depicts the infectious axis \"virus-CAR-T cells-memory cells\". The theoretical analysis provides a positive therapeutic action; the delay in viral production may have a significant impact on the early stages of infection. Although it is necessary to carefully evaluate the possible side effects of therapy. This work introduces the possibility of hypothesizing an antiviral use by CAR-T cells.35594023<SEP>Xin Qi<SEP>Predicting the Disease Severity of Virus Infection<SEP>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented burden on global health and economic systems, promoting worldwide efforts to understand, control, and fight the disease. Due to the wide spectrum of clinical severity, effective risk factors, biomarkers, and models for predicting disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients are urgently needed to provide guidance for clinical intervention and management. In this chapter, we first describe the infection features of different COVID-19 strains and the potential of clinical features, cytokine storm and biomarkers in predicting the severity of COVID-19 patients. We focus on how scoring systems, mathematical models and artificial intelligence (AI)-based models can promote the classification of COVID-19 severity at the population or individual level. Moreover, the development perspective of biomarkers and models for predicting the severity of COVID-19 is prospected. Therefore, this chapter highlights the clinical significance of biomarkers and models related to COVID-19 severity and provides important clues for improving the outcomes of COVID-19 patients, thereby facilitating timely disease assessment and precision medicine for individual COVID-19 patients.",
    "answer": "**Impact of Chronic Stress on the Immune System and Susceptibility to Illness: Multi-Perspective Analysis**\n\n**From the Context of Impaired Dendritic Cell Homing in COVID-19:**\nChronic stress has been found to impede the functionality and distribution of immune cells, similar to the observations in Lukas Borcherding's study on **SARS-CoV-2** affecting **dendritic cells (DCs)**. Normally, DC maturation is crucial for antigen presentation and T-cell activation, a process which is hindered in **COVID-19 patients**. An accumulation of immature DCs unable to reach lymph nodes leads to an inadequate T-cell response, thus increasing vulnerability to infection, much like how chronic stress might dysregulate the adaptive immune system.\n\n**From the Role of Tannic Acid against SARS-CoV-2 Entry:**\nChronic stress might affect key receptors and molecules involved in pathogen entry into cells. Xi Chen's research looks at blocking **SARS-CoV-2's entry by targeting hACE2 receptors**. Stress can alter receptor expression or immune signaling pathways, potentially influencing how diseases like COVID-19 can infiltrate and spread within the body, similarly to how tannic acid is posited to interfere with viral cell entry.\n\n**From the Forecasting Action of CAR-T Cells against Infection:**\nKhaled A Al-Utaibi's exploration of **CAR-T cells** in fighting **SARS-CoV-2** hints at the creative immunotherapies that might be compromised by chronic stress. As chronic stress could down-regulate the body's own antiviral responses, the therapeutic effectiveness of cutting-edge interventions like CAR-T cell therapy may also be reduced, since the overall immune context in which these engineered cells operate is compromised.\n\n**From Predicting the Disease Severity of Virus Infection:**\nChronic stress can be paralleled to factors that exacerbate disease severity in COVID-19, as detailed by Xin Qi. Stress can dysregulate cytokines and impair immune signaling, leading to a weakened defense against infections. This parallels the cytokine storm observed in severe COVID-19 cases and could potentially contribute to predicting disease severity, much like the biomarkers and AI-based models discussed.\n\nIn summary, chronic stress appears to share mechanisms with those described in the context of COVID-19 research\u2014it dysregulates immune cell functions, including impaired homing and maturation of DCs, could alter susceptibility to pathogen entry, and possibly weaken innovative immune therapies. Furthermore, it could contribute to the cytokine imbalances seen in severe disease manifestations, overall increasing susceptibility to illness.",

    "question": "What is the relationship between hypertension and kidney disease?",
    "context": "36878233<SEP>Kristina Boss<SEP>[Staging of kidney disease today and tomorrow]<SEP>Since September 2022, there is a new, German-language glossary for the nomenclature of renal function and renal disease, aligned with international technical terms and KDIGO guidelines for a more precise and uniform description of the facts. Terms such as \"renal disease,\" \"renal insufficiency,\" or \"acute renal failure\" should be avoided and replaced with \"disease\" or \"functional impairment.\"The KDIGO guideline recommends in patients with CKD stage G3a, in addition to the determination of serum creatinine, the additional determination of cystatin to confirm the CKD stage. A combination of serum creatinine and cystatin C to estimate GFR without taking into account the so-called race coefficient seems to be more accurate in African Americans than the previous eGFR formulas. However, there is no recommendation on this in international guidelines yet. For Caucasians, the formula does not change.Renal function impairment lasting more than 7 days but less than 3 months is called acute kidney disease (AKD). The AKD stage is the critical time window for therapeutic interventions to reduce the risk of progression in kidney disease.A future, expanded AKI definition incorporating biomarkers will allow patients to be divided into subclasses according to functional and structural limitations, thus mapping the two-dimensionality of AKI. By using artificial intelligence, large amounts of data from clinical parameters, blood and urine samples, histopathological and molecular markers (including proteomics and metabolomics data) can be used integratively for the graduation of CKD and thus contribute significantly to individualized therapy.26808154<SEP>Mariano Rodriguez<SEP>A New Data Analysis System to Quantify Associations between Biochemical Parameters of Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral Bone Disease<SEP>Background: In hemodialysis patients, deviations from KDIGO recommended values of individual parameters, phosphate, calcium or parathyroid hormone (PTH), are associated with increased mortality. However, it is widely accepted that these parameters are not regulated independently of each other and that therapy aimed to correct one parameter often modifies the others. The aim of the present study is to quantify the degree of association between parameters of chronic kidney disease and mineral bone disease (CKD-MBD). Methods: Data was extracted from a cohort of 1758 adult HD patients between January 2000 and June 2013 obtaining a total of 46.141 records (10 year follow-up). We used an advanced data analysis system called Random Forest (RF) which is based on self-learning procedure with similar axioms to those utilized for the development of artificial intelligence. This new approach is particularly useful when the variables analyzed are closely dependent to each other. Results: The analysis revealed a strong association between PTH and phosphate that was superior to that of PTH and Calcium. The classical linear regression analysis between PTH and phosphate shows a correlation coefficient is 0.27, p<0.001, the possibility to predict PTH changes from phosphate modification is marginal. Alternatively, RF assumes that changes in phosphate will cause modifications in other associated variables (calcium and others) that may also affect PTH values. Using RF the correlation coefficient between changes in serum PTH and phosphate is 0.77, p<0.001; thus, the power of prediction is markedly increased. The effect of therapy on biochemical variables was also analyzed using this RF. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the analysis of the complex interactions between mineral metabolism parameters in CKD-MBD may demand a more advanced data analysis system such as RF.34791422<SEP>Tae Won Yi<SEP>Digital health and artificial intelligence in kidney research: a report from the 2020 Kidney Disease Clinical Trialists (KDCT) meeting<SEP>The exponential growth in digital technology coupled with the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is driving a profound change in the delivery of medical care and research conduct. The growing availability of electronic monitoring, electronic health records, smartphones and other devices and access to ever greater computational power provides not only new opportunities, but also new challenges. Artificial intelligence (AI) exemplifies the potential of this digital revolution, which also includes other tools such as mobile health (mHealth) services and wearables. Despite digital technology becoming commonplace, its use in medicine and medical research is still in its infancy, with many clinicians and researchers having limited experience with such tools in their usual practice. This article, derived from the 'Digital Health and Artificial Intelligence' session of the Kidney Disease Clinical Trialists virtual workshop held in September 2020, aims to illustrate the breadth of applications to which digital tools and AI can be applied in clinical medicine and research. It highlights several innovative projects incorporating digital technology that range from streamlining medical care of those with acute kidney injury to the use of AI to navigate the vast genomic and proteomic data gathered in kidney disease. Important considerations relating to any new digital health project are presented, with a view to encouraging the further evolution and refinement of these new tools in a manner that fosters collaboration and the generation of robust evidence.33918173<SEP>Cesare Lancellotti<SEP>Artificial Intelligence & Tissue Biomarkers: Advantages, Risks and Perspectives for Pathology<SEP>Tissue Biomarkers are information written in the tissue and used in Pathology to recognize specific subsets of patients with diagnostic, prognostic or predictive purposes, thus representing the key elements of Personalized Medicine.

    "answer": "The relationship between hypertension (high blood pressure) and kidney disease is both complex and significant. Understanding this relationship requires an exploration of how these conditions influence one another and the overall impact on an individual's health. There are several key points to consider based on the provided context:\n\n**1. Kidney Function and Hypertension:** The kidneys play an essential role in regulating blood pressure by controlling the volume of fluids and the balance of electrolytes in the body. Impaired kidney function, which may be referred to as \"renal disease\" or \"functional impairment,\" can lead to the development or worsening of hypertension. According to the updated glossary mentioned in the context, these terms are now aligned with international technical terms and KDIGO guidelines to standardize descriptions.\n\n**2. Chronic Kidney Disease Staging:** Staging of kidney disease allows for the assessment of the severity of the condition. The KDIGO guideline notes that for patients with CKD stage G3a, it is recommended to determine serum creatinine levels, as well as cystatin C levels, to confirm the CKD stage. Accurate staging is crucial because hypertension is one of the factors that can contribute to the progression of kidney disease.\n\n**3. Accurate Estimation of Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR):** The context points out that combining serum creatinine and cystatin C levels may offer a more reliable estimation of GFR - a measure of kidney function - without relying on the race coefficient. This is particularly important for African Americans, as previous eGFR formulas were less accurate for this group. Accurate GFR measurement is central to managing both kidney disease and hypertension, which are interconnected.\n\n**4. Acute Kidney Disease (AKD):** AKD refers to renal function impairment lasting more than 7 days but less than 3 months. Hypertension is a risk factor for AKD and can instigate or exacerbate renal damage. Prompt therapeutic interventions during the AKD stage can reduce the risk of disease progression to chronic kidney disease.\n\n**5. AI and Personalized Medicine:** The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine holds potential for more personalized and accurate treatment. By utilizing AI to analyze clinical parameters, blood and urine samples, and other markers, clinicians can better understand the individual nuances of a patient's kidney disease and its relationship to hypertension.\n\n**6. CKD-Mineral Bone Disease (CKD-MBD):** The interaction between mineral metabolism parameters such as phosphate, calcium, and parathyroid hormone (PTH), plays a role in the health of individuals with CKD. Since hypertension can affect these parameters, understanding the complex interactions using advanced data systems like Random Forest, as mentioned in the second context, might provide insights into managing both CKD-MBD and hypertension more effectively.\n\nIn summary, hypertension and kidney disease are intricately connected, with hypertension both a cause and a consequence of kidney impairment. Advances in medical terminology, diagnostic guidelines, AI, and data analysis are improving the accuracy of diagnoses, staging, and treatment, which are pivotal in managing the interplay between these two conditions. The utilization of AI in analyzing vast amounts of data and in the staging of kidney disease can lead to more individualized treatment plans, which may improve outcomes for patients with both hypertension and kidney disease.",

Nevertheless, inactivity is a worldwide pandemic, and methods to augment exercise benefits are required. The constrained disorder principle (CDP) characterizes biological systems based on their inherent variability. We aimed to investigate the association between intra-individual variability in PA and disability among non-athlete adults. Methods: In this retrospective analysis of the longitudinal SHARE survey, we included non-disabled adults aged >50 with at least six visits over 14 years. Self-reported PA frequency was documented bi- to triennially. Low PA intensity was defined as vigorous PA frequency less than once a week. Stable PA was described as an unchanged PA intensity in all consecutive middle observations. The primary outcome was defined as a physical limitation in everyday activities at the end of the survey. Secondary outcomes were cognitive functions, including short-term memory, long-term memory, and verbal fluency.

The recently developed metric for physical activity (PA) tracking called Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) takes into account age, sex, resting and maximum heart rate, and a score of \u2265100 weekly PAI has been shown to reduce the risk of premature CVD death in healthy as well as individuals with known CVD risk factors, regardless of whether or not the current PA recommendations were met. The aim of the present study was to examine if PAI modifies the associations between SB and CVD risk factor (CV-RF) clustering in a large apparently healthy general population cohort (n=29,950, aged \u226520 years). Logistic regression revealed that in those with \u2265100 weekly PAI, the likelihood of CV-RF clustering prevalence associated with prolonged SB was attenuated across age groups. Monitoring weekly PAI-level could be useful to ensure that people perform enough PA to combat SB's deleterious association with CV-RF.35814574<SEP>Haobo Liu<SEP>Design of the Physical Fitness Evaluation Information Management System of Sports Athletes Based on Artificial Intelligence<SEP>With the rapid development of science and technology in recent years, more and more researchers began to explore the basic disciplines of sports, namely, biomechanics and physiology, and further update and improve the traditional sports training theory. However, the developed countries, i.e., Europe and the United States, have dedicatedly worked on the effective role of physical training particularly in middle-class farmers in sports powers. They have realized that the continuous improvement of the physical training evaluation system is directly related to the reforming in the evaluation and monitoring methods of physical training. At the same time, there is a demand for athletes' physical fitness evaluation, which requires a large amount of data support during the evaluation. These data collection and analysis are difficult and consume a lot of manpower. Therefore, this paper uses artificial intelligence technology to design the sports athletes' physical fitness evaluation information management system to improve the comprehensiveness of system data collection and the accuracy of data analysis. Through the physical attenuation calculation and physical analysis of the system developed in this paper, data accuracy is high. The coach can make a training plan according to the physical consumption of athletes in sports training or competition, which can greatly improve the ability of athletes.",
    "answer": "**Untreated Mental Health Disorders and Physical Health Impacts**\n\nUntreated mental health disorders can have a profound effect on physical health over time, and this concept is indirectly supported by and intertwined with the findings in the context provided by your vector database. Let's explore this through different perspectives illuminated by the context:\n\n1. **Impact on Physical Activity and Disability (38196652):**\n   The research by Yaron Ilan on the significance of variability in physical activity (PA) and age-related dysfunctions suggests that regular PA is crucial for mental and physical health. Untreated mental health disorders can lead to decreased motivation, causing reduced PA, which may subsequently increase the risk of physical impairments. This is analogous to the findings where low PA is associated with increased physical disability prevalence. Over time, a decline in mental health could potentially lead to stable low-intensity PA or inactivity, thereby worsening physical health outcomes.\n\n2. **Connection Between Physical Fitness and Cognitive Function (34523178):**\n   The study by R Cabeza-Ruiz demonstrates a correlation between physical fitness (PF), body mass index (BMI), and intelligence quotient (IQ) in individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID). It's reasonable to extend this correlation to the general population, suggesting that untreated mental health disorders might impair cognitive functions and by indirect relation, physical fitness. This could be due to a lack of engagement in activities that maintain or improve muscle strength and endurance, which are linked to better cognitive performance.\n\n3. **Interplay Between Sedentary Behavior and Cardiovascular Health (28274818):**\n   Nina Zisko's work on Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) and the impact of sedentary behavior (SB) on cardiovascular risk factors underscores that higher levels of PA can mitigate the negative effects of SB. If someone with a mental health disorder becomes more sedentary as a result of their symptoms (e.g., depression leading to inactivity), their cardiovascular health may be at significant risk. Ensuring sufficient PA, as indicated by PAI, could combat such risks, but untreated mental health disorders may prevent individuals from achieving necessary PA levels.\n\n4. **Advancements in Physical Fitness Evaluations (35814574):**\n   Haobo Liu's discussion on the design of a physical fitness evaluation information management system using artificial intelligence shows the value of regular monitoring and precise evaluation of athletes' physical fitness. An unmanaged mental health disorder could diminish an individual's capacity to engage in regular fitness evaluations. This lack of attention to their physical state may allow physical health problems to go unnoticed and worsen over time.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFrom these various perspectives, we can infer that untreated mental health disorders have the potential to negatively influence physical health by reducing participation in physical activities, exacerbating sedentary behaviors, and diminishing cognitive functioning, which further impacts physical fitness. This integrated view emphasizes the importance of managing mental health not just for psychological well-being, but also for maintaining and improving physical health outcomes.",

    "context": "35840990<SEP>Philip J Freda Jr<SEP>Novel digital approaches to the assessment of problematic opioid use<SEP>The opioid epidemic continues to contribute to loss of life through overdose and significant social and economic burdens. Many individuals who develop problematic opioid use (POU) do so after being exposed to prescribed opioid analgesics. Therefore, it is important to accurately identify and classify risk factors for POU. In this review, we discuss the etiology of POU and highlight novel approaches to identifying its risk factors. These approaches include the application of polygenic risk scores (PRS) and diverse machine learning (ML) algorithms used in tandem with data from electronic health records (EHR), clinical notes, patient demographics, and digital footprints. The implementation and synergy of these types of data and approaches can greatly assist in reducing the incidence of POU and opioid-related mortality by increasing the knowledge base of patient-related risk factors, which can help to improve prescribing practices for opioid analgesics.37428897<SEP>Duncan C McElfresh<SEP>A call for better validation of opioid overdose risk algorithms<SEP>Clinical decision support (CDS) systems powered by predictive models have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of clinical decision-making. However, without sufficient validation, these systems have the potential to mislead clinicians and harm patients. This is especially true for CDS systems used by opioid prescribers and dispensers, where a flawed prediction can directly harm patients. To prevent these harms, regulators and researchers have proposed guidance for validating predictive models and CDS systems. However, this guidance is not universally followed and is not required by law. We call on CDS developers, deployers, and users to hold these systems to higher standards of clinical and technical validation. We provide a case study on two CDS systems deployed on a national scale in the United States for predicting a patient's risk of adverse opioid-related events: the Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation (STORM), used by the Veterans Health Administration, and NarxCare, a commercial system.37037255<SEP>Sajjad Fouladvand<SEP>A Comparative Effectiveness Study on Opioid Use Disorder Prediction Using Artificial Intelligence and Existing Risk Models<SEP>Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a leading cause of death in the United States placing a tremendous burden on patients, their families, and health care systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be harnessed with available healthcare data to produce automated OUD prediction tools. In this retrospective study, we developed AI based models for OUD prediction and showed that AI can predict OUD more effectively than existing clinical tools including the unweighted opioid risk tool (ORT). Data include 474,208 patients' data over 10 years; 269,748 were females with an average age of 56.78 years. Cases are prescription opioid users with at least one diagnosis of OUD or at least one prescription for buprenorphine or methadone. Controls are prescription opioid users with no OUD diagnoses or buprenorphine or methadone prescriptions. On 100 randomly selected test sets including 47,396 patients, our proposed transformer-based AI model can predict OUD more efficiently (AUC = 0.742 \u00b1 0.021) compared to logistic regression (AUC = 0.651 \u00b1 0.025), random forest (AUC = 0.679 \u00b1 0.026), xgboost (AUC = 0.690 \u00b1 0.027), long short-term memory model (AUC = 0.706 \u00b1 0.026), transformer (AUC = 0.725 \u00b1 0.024), and unweighted ORT model (AUC = 0.559 \u00b1 0.025). Our results show that embedding AI algorithms into clinical care may assist clinicians in risk stratification and management of patients receiving opioid therapy.35605072<SEP>En-Ju D. Lin<SEP>Digital Health for the Opioid Crisis: A Historical Analysis of NIH Funding from 2013 to 2017<SEP>Prior to the COVID-19 crisis, the opioid crisis was the major public health challenge ravaging economies and communities across the United States. Digital health offered new ways to reach, diagnose, and treat individuals with opioid use disorders. Federal research funding usually reflects the nation\u2019s research priorities and shapes the direction of innovation. We reviewed funded projects by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) from 2013 to 2017, a period leading to the substantial increase in federal funding and the launch of the $500M HEAL (Helping End Addiction Long-TermSM) initiative in 2018. We presented our viewpoint of the research landscape of the digital health development for the opioid crisis. Overall, there was a gradual increase in NIDA grant funding for technology in the opioid crisis and the percentage of NIDA technology awards funding new projects had nearly doubled in that period. We categorize the types of applications and potential challenges in five emerging technology categories: electronic health, mobile health, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and biosensor. Diversification of funding in these categories offers the promise of more innovation in new technologies to combat the opioid epidemic.",
    "answer": "The original question pertains to the health risks associated with long-term use of specific medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which is a distinct topic from the context provided, which focuses on opioid use and its associated risks and management strategies. To address the original question within the framework of the given context, it is helpful to draw parallels and contrast the issues relating to opioid use with those of NSAIDs.\n\n# Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)\nNSAIDs are commonly used for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties to treat conditions such as pain, inflammation, and fever. Long-term use of NSAIDs, however, carries risks:\n\n- **Gastrointestinal (GI) Complications**: The risk of peptic ulcers, GI bleeding, and other gastrointestinal issues increases with prolonged NSAID use due to their effect on inhibiting the COX-1 enzyme, which protects the stomach lining.\n\n- **Cardiovascular Risks**: Some NSAIDs may elevate the risk of heart attack, stroke, and hypertension, particularly with long-term use or in individuals with existing cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n- **Renal Complications**: Long-term NSAID use can impair kidney function, potentially leading to chronic kidney disease or failure due to the reduction in blood flow to the kidneys.\n\n- **Increased Risk of Bleeding**: NSAIDs can interfere with platelet function, increasing the risk of bleeding, which is of particular concern in individuals taking anticoagulant medications.\n\n# Opioids and Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nThe context provided speaks specifically about opioid use, its associated risks, predicting problematic opioid use (POU), and improving prescribing practices through the use of AI and digital tools:\n\n- Opioid use can lead to opioid use disorder (OUD), overdose, and related mortality, which differs from the chronic health risks associated with NSAIDs.\n  \n- AI models have shown promise in predicting OUD, potentially more accurately than existing risk assessment tools, which could influence prescribing practices and reduce incidence.\n\n- Novel digital health applications and federal funding for research into such technologies (as detailed in the context) focus on the opioid crisis rather than on NSAIDs.\n\nIn summary, the long-term use of NSAIDs carries specific health risks primarily related to the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal systems. This differs from the acute overdose risks and the chronic addiction potential posed by opioids. While the given context discusses the application of AI and digital technology in addressing the opioid crisis, the fundamental health concerns vary between opioid use and NSAID use. AI and digital technology could, in theory, also be applied to improve NSAID prescribing practices and to monitor for adverse effects, making personalized and safer treatment decisions.",

    "context": "25398574<SEP>Julio Sotelo<SEP>The nervous and the immune systems: conspicuous physiological analogies<SEP>From all biological constituents of complex organisms, two are highly sophisticated: the nervous and the immune systems. Interestingly, their goals and processes appear to be distant from each other; however, their physiological mechanisms keep notorious similarities. Both construct intelligence, learn from experience, and keep memory. Their precise responses to innumerable stimuli are delicately modulated, and the exposure of the individual to thousands of potential challenges integrates their functionality; they use a large part of their constituents not in excitatory activities but in the maintenance of inhibitory mechanisms to keep silent vast intrinsic potentialities. The nervous and immune systems are integrated by a basic cell lineage (neurons and lymphocytes, respectively) but each embodies countless cell subgroups with different and specialized deeds which, in contrast with cells from other organs, labyrinthine molecular arrangements conduct to \"one cell, one function\". Also, nervous and immune actions confer identity that differentiates every individual from countless others in the same species. Both systems regulate and potentiate their responses aided by countless biological resources of variable intensity: hormones, peptides, cytokines, pro-inflammatory molecules, etc. How the immune and the nervous systems buildup memory, learning capability, and exquisite control of excitatory/inhibitory mechanisms constitute major intellectual challenges for contemporary research.35216895<SEP>John D Mollon<SEP>What kind of network is the brain?<SEP>The different areas of the cerebral cortex are linked by a network of white matter, comprising the myelinated axons of pyramidal cells. Is this network a neural net, in the sense that representations of the world are embodied in the structure of the net, its pattern of nodes, and connections? Or is it a communications network, where the same physical substrate carries different information from moment to moment? This question is part of the larger question of whether the brain is better modeled by connectionism or by symbolic artificial intelligence (AI), but we review it in the specific context of the psychophysics of stimulus comparison and the format and protocol of information transmission over the long-range tracts of the brain.30723470<SEP>Irun R Cohen<SEP>The Immune System Computes the State of the Body: Crowd Wisdom, Machine Learning, and Immune Cell Reference Repertoires Help Manage Inflammation<SEP>Here, we outline an overview of the mammalian immune system that updates and extends the classical clonal selection paradigm. Rather than focusing on strict self-not-self discrimination, we propose that the system orchestrates variable inflammatory responses that maintain the body and its symbiosis with the microbiome while eliminating the threat from pathogenic infectious agents and from tumors. The paper makes four points: The immune system classifies healthy and pathologic states of the body-including both self and foreign elements-by deploying individual lymphocytes as cellular computing machines; immune cells transform input signals from the body into an output of specific immune reactions.Rather than independent clonal responses, groups of individually activated immune-system cells co-react in lymphoid organs to make collective decisions through a type of self-organizing swarm intelligence or crowd wisdom.Collective choices by swarms of immune cells, like those of schools of fish, are modified by relatively small numbers of individual regulators responding to shifting conditions-such collective inflammatory responses are dynamically responsive.Self-reactive autoantibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires shared by healthy individuals function in a biological version of experience-based supervised machine learning. Immune system decisions are primed by formative experience with training sets of self-antigens encountered during lymphocyte development; these initially trained T cell and B cell repertoires form a Wellness Profile that then guides immune responses to test sets of antigens encountered later. This experience-based machine learning strategy is analogous to that deployed by supervised machine-learning algorithms. We propose experiments to test these ideas. This overview of the immune system bears clinical implications for monitoring wellness and for treating autoimmune disease, cancer, and allograft reactions.29554549<SEP>Carolina de Medeiros Rimkus<SEP>The protective effects of high-education levels on cognition in different stages of multiple sclerosis<SEP>Background: Low-education attainment is associated with worse cognitive performance in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and possibly with a lower cognitive reserve and/or increased inflammatory activity. Cognitive reserve refers to the capability of a source of intellectual enrichment in attenuating a negative effect of a disease-related factor; while the inflammatory activity is often related to T2-lesion load (T2-LL) increase. Objective: To disentangle the effects of cognitive reserve and an increased T2-LL in MS-patients with low-education levels. Methods: The study included 136 MS patients and 65 healthy-controls, divided in low-education (12 years or less of school education without obtaining any technical superior degree) and high-education (more than 12 years of school education with technical or superior degree) groups. An extensive battery of neuropsychological tests was applied examining intelligence quotient and six cognitive domains. Test results were z-scored and subjects with z-scores \u2264 -1.5 in two or more domains were considered cognitively impaired. To test the factors associated with worse cognitive performance, regression models were applied using average cognition as target; education level, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), T2-LL, disease duration, age of disease onset, age and gender as predictors. We also tested the correlation between T2-LL and cognition in the groups. To investigate the role of education level as a source of intellectual enrichment/cognitive reserve in different stages of MS, we sub-divided the MS patients in three groups according to the disease duration (less than 5 years, between 5 and 10 years and more than 10 years). Results: Worse average cognition was associated with low-education level, higher T2-LL and male gender. A higher frequency of cognitively impaired patients was observed in MS patients with low-education level, in all stages of the disease. In patients with a disease duration shorter than five years, there was a lower correlation between worse average cognition and T2-LL in the high-education level group, compared to the patients with low-education level; in MS patients with longer disease duration, we observed a stronger correlation between lesion burden and cognitive impairment in both groups. Conclusion: Education attainment is a source of intellectual enrichment and can enhance the cognitive reserve in MS patients. The protective effect of a high-education level was stronger in patients with less than five years of disease, suggesting a stronger role of cognitive reserve in short-term disease. In long-term disease we observed a greater impact of increased inflammatory activity on cognition.",
    "answer": "Based on the contextual information provided from the cited papers, we can discuss how the immune response to vaccination may differ from that to an actual infection:\n\n1. **Analogy with Learning and Memory in Biological Systems**:\n   - Both the nervous system and the immune system construct intelligence, learn from experience, and keep memory (from the context provided by Julio Sotelo).\n   - In the context of vaccination and infection, we can compare this learning and memory to how the immune system responds to a vaccine, which introduces an antigen in a controlled and safe way, allowing the immune system to 'learn' and create 'memory' of the pathogen. This memory, formed by B and T cells, is then used to mount a quicker and stronger response upon re-exposure to the pathogen, either via a natural infection or a booster shot.\n\n2. **Nature of the Immune Response**:\n   - Irun R Cohen's paper emphasizes the immune system as a computational entity that turns input signals into specific immune reactions and makes collective decisions. A vaccination essentially provides the immune system with a particular input (antigen), which allows it to prepare its computational response (including building up a repertoire of antibodies and T-cells) for when it encounters the real pathogen.\n   - In contrast, an actual infection provides not just an antigen, but also the context of a replicating pathogen capable of causing damage, which the immune system must respond to immediately and aggressively. The involvement of the immune system is thus more extensive during an actual infection, with a broader inflammatory response.\n\n3. **Supervised Machine Learning Analogy and Experience-Based Priming**:\n   - The concept of the immune system using experience-based supervised machine learning to prime immune decisions (as proposed by Irun R Cohen) matches closely to how vaccination serves to 'educate' the immune system. The vaccine's antigens act as the training set, upon which the immune system builds its reference repertoire \u2014 the Wellness Profile.\n   - In the case of the actual infection, the immune system's reference repertoires are activated without prior 'controlled' training, meaning the immune response can be more varied and is shaped by the immediate and perhaps more complex signals being received from the infection, unlike the structured input from a vaccine.\n\n4. **Cognitive Reserve in Immune System Function**:\n   - Carolina de Medeiros Rimkus discusses the concept of cognitive reserve in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), but this can also metaphorically relate to the immune resistance built up through 'intellectual enrichment' via vaccination.\n   - In the early stages of MS, cognitive reserve seems to protect against cognitive decline, similar to how early vaccination can impart strong immunity and 'reserves' the immune system to perform efficiently against future infections. Over time, however, increased disease burden (in the case of MS) or ongoing exposure to pathogens (as for the immune system) can strain this reserve.\n\nThus, in summary, the immune response to vaccination is like a preparatory drill, 'educating' the immune system to recognize and respond efficiently to future encounters with a pathogen. On the other hand, the response to an actual infection is an immediate real-world application of the immune system's full abilities, potentially involving more complex interactions, greater inflammation, and a broader activation of the immune system's resources. Vaccination is designed to mimic certain aspects of infection, thereby providing the benefits of immunity without the risks associated with an actual disease.",

    "context": "36427724<SEP>Rhiannon Thompson<SEP>Air pollution and human cognition: A systematic review and meta-analysis<SEP>Background: This systematic review summarises and evaluates the literature investigating associations between exposure to air pollution and general population cognition, which has important implications for health, social and economic inequalities, and human productivity. Methods: The engines MEDLINE, Embase Classic+Embase, APA PsycInfo, and SCOPUS were searched up to May 2022. Our inclusion criteria focus on the following pollutants: particulate matter, NOx, and ozone. The cognitive abilities of interest are: general/global cognition, executive function, attention, working memory, learning, memory, intelligence and IQ, reasoning, reaction times, and processing speed. The collective evidence was assessed using the NTP-OHAT framework and random-effects meta-analyses. Results: Eighty-six studies were identified, the results of which were generally supportive of associations between exposures and worsened cognition, but the literature was varied and sometimes contradictory. There was moderate certainty support for detrimental associations between PM2.5 and general cognition in adults 40+, and PM2.5, NOx, and PM10 and executive function (especially working memory) in children. There was moderate certainty evidence against associations between ozone and general cognition in adults age 40+, and NOx and reasoning/IQ in children. Some associations were also supported by meta-analysis (N = 14 studies, all in adults aged 40+). A 1 \u03bcg/m3 increase in NO2 was associated with reduced performance on general cognitive batteries (\u03b2 = -0.02, p < 0.05) as was a 1 \u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure (\u03b2 = -0.02, p < 0.05). A 1\u03bcgm3 increase in PM2.5 was significantly associated with lower verbal fluency by -0.05 words (p = 0.01) and a decrease in executive function task performance of -0.02 points (p < 0.001). Discussion: Evidence was found in support of some exposure-outcome associations, however more good quality research is required, particularly with older teenagers and young adults (14-40 years), using multi-exposure modelling, incorporating mechanistic investigation, and in South America, Africa, South Asia and Australasia.35730943<SEP>Battsetseg Ulziikhuu<SEP>Portable HEPA Filter Air Cleaner Use during Pregnancy and Children's Cognitive Performance at Four Years of Age: The UGAAR Randomized Controlled Trial<SEP>Background: Developmental exposure to air pollution is associated with diminished cognitive abilities in observational studies, but no randomized controlled trial has examined the effect of reducing air pollution on cognition in children. Objectives: We sought to quantify the impact of reducing exposure to particulate matter (PM) during pregnancy on children's cognitive performance at 4 y of age. Methods: In this single-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, we randomly assigned 540 nonsmoking pregnant women (268 intervention and 272 control) to receive 1-2 portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter air cleaners or no air cleaners. The air cleaners were used from a median of 11 wk gestation until the end of pregnancy. The primary outcome was full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) assessed using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV) when children were a median of 48 months old. We imputed missing outcome data using multiple imputation with chained equations, and our primary analysis was by intention to treat. Results: After excluding known miscarriages, stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and medical conditions that impeded cognitive testing and imputation, 475 (233 control and 242 intervention) children were included in our analyses. In an unadjusted analysis, the mean FSIQ of children who were randomly assigned to the intervention group was 2.5 points [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.4, 5.4 points] higher than that of children in the control group. After adjustment to account for an imbalance in preterm birth between groups, the effect estimate increased to 2.8 points (95% CI: -0.1, 5.7).

If so, how? The Database of Raising Intelligence is a continuously updated compendium of randomized controlled trials that were designed to increase intelligence. In this article, the authors examine nearly every available intervention involving children from birth to kindergarten, using meta-analytic procedures when more than 3 studies tested similar methods and reviewing interventions when too few were available for meta-analysis. This yielded 4 meta-analyses on the effects of dietary supplementation to pregnant mothers and neonates, early educational interventions, interactive reading, and sending a child to preschool. All 4 meta-analyses yielded significant results: Supplementing infants with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, enrolling children in early educational interventions, reading to children in an interactive manner, and sending children to preschool all raise the intelligence of young children.35737514<SEP>Yu Ni<SEP>Associations of Pre- and Postnatal Air Pollution Exposures with Child Behavioral Problems and Cognitive Performance: A U.S. Multi-Cohort Study<SEP>Background: Population studies support the adverse associations of air pollution exposures with child behavioral functioning and cognitive performance, but few studies have used spatiotemporally resolved pollutant assessments. Objectives: We investigated these associations using more refined exposure assessments in 1,967 mother-child dyads from three U.S. pregnancy cohorts in six cities in the ECHO-PATHWAYS Consortium. Methods: Pre- and postnatal nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM) \u22642.5\u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) exposures were derived from an advanced spatiotemporal model. Child behavior was reported as Total Problems raw score using the Child Behavior Checklist at age 4-6 y. Child cognition was assessed using cohort-specific cognitive performance scales and quantified as the Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ). We fitted multivariate linear regression models that were adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychological factors to estimate associations per 2-unit increase in pollutant in each exposure window and examined modification by child sex. Identified critical windows were further verified by distributed lag models (DLMs). Results: Mean NO2 and PM2.5 ranged from 8.4 to 9.0 ppb and 8.4 to 9.1 \u03bcg/m3, respectively, across pre- and postnatal windows. Average child Total Problems score and IQ were 22.7 [standard deviation (SD): 18.5] and 102.6 (SD: 15.3), respectively. Children with higher prenatal NO2 exposures were likely to have more behavioral problems [\u03b2: 1.24; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.39, 2.08; per 2 ppb NO2], particularly NO2 in the first and second trimester. Each 2-\u03bcg/m3 increase in PM2.5 at age 2-4 y was associated with a 3.59 unit (95% CI: 0.35, 6.84) higher Total Problems score and a 2.63 point (95% CI: -5.08, -0.17) lower IQ. The associations between PM2.5 and Total Problems score were generally stronger in girls. Most predefined windows identified were not confirmed by DLMs. Discussion: Our study extends earlier findings that have raised concerns about impaired behavioral functioning and cognitive performance in children exposed to NO2 and PM2.5 in utero and in early life. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10248.",
    "answer": "Given the context provided from the vector database, the impact of environmental factors such as air pollution on respiratory health can be discussed by considering the broader implications on human health and development, including cognitive abilities and behavioral functioning. Here is an analysis of the provided literature, structured to address the original question while incorporating insights relevant to the context:\n\n**Impact of Air Pollution on Human Health: A Focus on Cognitive and Developmental Outcomes**\n\n1. **Air Pollution and Cognition in Adults and Children**  \n   Rhiannon Thompson's systematic review highlights the negative associations between various air pollutants, notably particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and ozone, with cognitive abilities across different age groups. Notably, the study demonstrates detrimental impacts on executive functions, particularly working memory in children, and general cognition in adults aged 40 and above. This aligns with the concept of environmental factors affecting human health beyond the respiratory system, suggesting that air pollution can also impair cognitive functions.\n\n2. **Intervention Study on Reducing Air Pollution Exposure During Pregnancy**  \n   Battsetseg Ulziikhuu's randomized controlled trial assesses the efficacy of using HEPA filter air cleaners during pregnancy on the subsequent cognitive performance of children. The study found that reducing PM exposure during pregnancy led to a slight but notable improvement in children's cognitive performance at 4 years old, measured by Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient scores. This demonstrates that intervention strategies aiming to reduce air pollution exposure can have positive ramifications on developmental outcomes, indicating a direct link between environmental conditions and child health.\n\n3. **Air Pollution and Child Development**  \n   Yu Ni's study in the U.S. reinforces the findings on the adverse effects of air pollution on children's behavior and cognitive performance, using refined exposure assessments. Importantly, prenatal exposure to NO2 was associated with increased behavioral problems, while early life exposure to PM2.5 was linked to both increased behavioral difficulties and reduced IQ. Here, the focus expands on how air pollution can influence neurological and psychological development, underpinning the importance of examining environmental factors as determinants of brain health.\n\n4. **Database of Raising Intelligence: Broader Insights**  \n   While not directly related to air pollution, John Protzko's work on the Database of Raising Intelligence provides auxiliary data that certain environmental interventions, such as dietary supplementation and early educational programs, can improve children's intelligence. Considering this information, it becomes plausible to infer that positive environmental adjustments, including improving air quality, might enhance cognitive outcomes, aligning with findings from the studies on air pollution.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n**Respiratory and Beyond**  \nAlthough the original question pertains to respiratory health, the presented research indicates a broader impact, encompassing cognitive and behavioral health. Air pollution evidently exerts its effect not just on the lungs but also on neurological development and functioning. This underscores the need for policies and interventions focused on reducing air pollution levels to safeguard overall health and cognitive capabilities, benefiting individuals across various life stages. \n\nIn conclusion, the impact of environmental factors on health, particularly air pollution, extends beyond traditional considerations of respiratory distress to encapsulate cognitive impairments. The presented literature vividly illustrates these associations and indicates potential benefits of air quality interventions for healthier developmental outcomes in children.",

    "context": "37393408<SEP>Julia Mariel Wirtz Baker<SEP>Non-traditional data sources in obesity research: a systematic review of their use in the study of obesogenic environments<SEP>Background: The complex nature of obesity increasingly requires a comprehensive approach that includes the role of environmental factors. For understanding contextual determinants, the resources provided by technological advances could become a key factor in obesogenic environment research. This study aims to identify different sources of non-traditional data and their applications, considering the domains of obesogenic environments: physical, sociocultural, political and economic. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Scopus and LILACS databases by two independent groups of reviewers, from September to December 2021. We included those studies oriented to adult obesity research using non-traditional data sources, published in the last 5 years in English, Spanish or Portuguese. The overall reporting followed the PRISMA guidelines. Results: The initial search yielded 1583 articles, 94 articles were kept for full-text screening, and 53 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included. We extracted information about countries of origin, study design, observation units, obesity-related outcomes, environment variables, and non-traditional data sources used. Our results revealed that most of the studies originated from high-income countries (86.54%) and used geospatial data within a GIS (76.67%), social networks (16.67%), and digital devices (11.66%) as data sources. Geospatial data were the most utilised data source and mainly contributed to the study of the physical domains of obesogenic environments, followed by social networks providing data to the analysis of the sociocultural domain. A gap in the literature exploring the political domain of environments was also evident. Conclusion: The disparities between countries are noticeable. Geospatial and social network data sources contributed to studying the physical and sociocultural environments, which could be a valuable complement to those traditionally used in obesity research. We propose the use of information available on the Internet, addressed by artificial intelligence-based tools, to increase the knowledge on political and economic dimensions of the obesogenic environment.37892318<SEP>Jo\u00e3o Rala Cordeiro<SEP>The Association between Childhood Obesity and Cardiovascular Changes in 10 Years Using Special Data Science Analysis<SEP>The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity is a worldwide problem, with several well-known consequences that might start to develop early in life during childhood. The present research based on data from children that have been followed since birth in a previously established cohort study (Generation XXI, Porto, Portugal), taking advantage of State-of-the-Art (SoA) data science techniques and methods, including Neural Architecture Search (NAS), explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and Deep Learning (DL), aimed to explore the hidden value of data, namely on electrocardiogram (ECG) records performed during follow-up visits. The combination of these techniques allowed us to clarify subtle cardiovascular changes already present at 10 years of age, which are evident from ECG analysis and probably induced by the presence of obesity. The proposed novel combination of new methodologies and techniques is discussed, as well as their applicability in other health domains.26888882<SEP>Peter J Aspinall<SEP>Establishing and sustaining health observatories serving urbanized populations around the world: scoping study and survey<SEP>Background: The 'health observatory' model has successfully proliferated across several world regions, this study being conducted to define the geographical and physical bases and main functions of health observatories serving largely urbanized populations and the support needed for set-up and sustainability. Methods: A scoping study of literature and observatory websites was undertaken to identify health observatories, main functions, year established and publications, followed by a self-completion survey to further investigate these characteristics, define the help observatories would have liked at set-up and later on, and how such help might effectively be accessed. Results: Of 69 health observatories contacted, 27 (39%) mainly established since 2000 completed the survey. Most responding observatories had a sub-national/regional or sub-regional/local geographical base and no one type of physical or organizational base predominated. Nearly all observatories undertook preparation of population-based health reports and intelligence, data analysis and interpretation services, and a primary commitment to working with local/regional partners to support evidence-based decision-making. Most prioritized help with deciding and defining the scope of the observatory, estimating the core resources required for establishing/developing it, addressing sustainability issues, identifying knowledge, skills and skill-mix required to undertake the health intelligence/analytic functions, accessing data/IT expertise and developing training and capacity-building programmes. The preferred means of accessing this support was a virtual network(s) of experts on particular topics to support mutual learning and toolboxes developed for specific observatory functions. Conclusions: Although the health observatory as an organizational model is maturing, the learning derived from sharing structured guidance and support is regarded as invaluable.37920276<SEP>Anupama Vijayakumar<SEP>Potential impact of artificial intelligence on the emerging world order<SEP>The fast-paced diffusion of technologies broadly falling under the umbrella of artificial intelligence (AI) is said to be shaping the emerging world order in international relations (IR). It is expected that the global AI race will pave the way for another rise and fall of great powers in the international system, similar to the impact caused by the three industrial revolutions of the past. The literature in IR identifies three major powers - namely, the United States of America (USA), China, and Russia, as the leading contenders in this AI race. The ongoing AI-enabled fourth industrial revolution is all the more unique due to the markedly different approaches these three powers have adopted for integrating AI into their military, political, and socio-economic spheres. The AI strategies of these countries further reflect their capabilities and intentions towards how they plan on employing the technology to elevate their prestige and power status in the international system. This paper draws from a historiography of the First, Second, and Third Industrial Revolutions to study how technological innovations have altered relative power capabilities of nations, triggering a re-ordering of power hierarchies at a systemic level. Drawing from this understanding, it analyses the nature of AI as an emerging technology and assesses whether it can cause systemic alterations. It critically examines and compares the AI strategies of the USA, China, and Russia as leading contenders in the global AI race and outlines their strengths and weaknesses. It further draws from the Adoption Capacity Theory to argue that the AI race may well be determined by the relative capacity of the major institutions in each of these countries to manage and adapt to the disruptions this technology is bound to bring to the fore.",
    "answer": "How does obesity elevate the risk of other conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes?\n\nTo understand how obesity elevates the risk of conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes, we can draw from the myriad of research represented by studies and systematic reviews such as those authored by Julia Mariel Wirtz Baker on non-traditional data sources in obesity research and Jo\u00e3o Rala Cordeiro's work on the association between childhood obesity and cardiovascular changes. While these studies approach obesity from different angles, they highlight the multifaceted nature of obesity-related health risks and the breadth of data that can be leveraged to comprehend these links.\n\nObesity impacts health through several pathways:\n\n1. **Metabolic Disruptions:**\n   Obesity can lead to metabolic syndrome, which includes a cluster of conditions such as high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol levels. These disruptions can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes by making the body resistant to insulin, resulting in elevated glucose in the bloodstream.\n\n2. **Mechanical Stress:**\n   Excessive body fat puts a strain on the body, especially on the heart and vascular system. With obesity, the heart has to work harder to pump blood throughout the body, which can lead to hypertension, heart disease, and an increased risk of stroke.\n\n3. **Inflammatory Responses:**\n   Obesity can lead to chronic low-grade inflammation in the body. This inflammatory state contributes to insulin resistance and atherosclerosis, the process where plaques form in the arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n4. **Endothelial Dysfunction:**\n   The endothelium, which is the lining of the blood vessels, can be damaged by the factors associated with obesity. This impacts the ability of the vessels to dilate, affecting blood flow and contributing to cardiovascular disease.\n\n5. **Ectopic Fat Deposition:**\n   Obesity can lead to the storage of fat in places where it can cause more harm, such as around the organs (visceral fat). Fat around the liver, for example, increases the risk for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which can exacerbate insulin resistance and increase the risk of diabetes.\n\n6. **Dyslipidemia:**\n   Often coming hand-in-hand with obesity is an alteration in lipid profiles characterized by increased LDL ('bad' cholesterol) and decreased HDL ('good' cholesterol). This dyslipidemia furthers the risk of coronary artery disease.\n\nResearch utilizing novel data sources and technologies, such as geospatial data and AI analysis of ECGs, highlights how early signs of obesity-related diseases can be detected and quantified. For example, Jo\u00e3o Rala Cordeiro's study on childhood obesity and cardiovascular changes uses advanced data science and AI to uncover early cardiovascular changes in children with obesity, indicating a link between early-onset obesity and later cardiovascular risk.\n\nIn the context of public health surveillance, as outlined in the scoping study on health observatories by Peter J Aspinall, the use of data analysis and interpretation services by health observatories can illuminate the health impacts of obesity across populations, guiding interventions.\n\nFurthermore, Anupama Vijayakumar's work on the impact of AI on the emerging world order is an indirect but cogent reminder of the importance of using AI technology in the healthcare domain. AI can be employed to process large datasets in healthcare, providing personalized risk assessments and uncovering novel insights into the relationship between obesity and its associated risks.\n\nIn summary, through metabolic changes, physical stress on the body, inflammatory processes, endothelial dysfunction, ectopic fat deposition, and dyslipidemia, obesity significantly increases the risk of developing heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The use of advanced data sources and AI in the study of these conditions can not only help us understand the mechanistic links better but also contribute to the early identification and potential prevention of these obesity-related diseases.",

    "context": "24324325<SEP>Simon Rosenfeld<SEP>Are the somatic mutation and tissue organization field theories of carcinogenesis incompatible?<SEP>Two drastically different approaches to understanding the forces driving carcinogenesis have crystallized through years of research. These are the somatic mutation theory (SMT) and the tissue organization field theory (TOFT). The essence of SMT is that cancer is derived from a single somatic cell that has successively accumulated multiple DNA mutations, and that those mutations occur on genes which control cell proliferation and cell cycle. Thus, according to SMT, neoplastic lesions are the results of DNA-level events. Conversely, according to TOFT, carcinogenesis is primarily a problem of tissue organization: carcinogenic agents destroy the normal tissue architecture thus disrupting cell-to-cell signaling and compromising genomic integrity. Hence, in TOFT the DNA mutations are the effect, and not the cause, of the tissue-level events. Cardinal importance of successful resolution of the TOFT versus SMT controversy dwells in the fact that, according to SMT, cancer is a unidirectional and mostly irreversible disease; whereas, according to TOFT, it is curable and reversible. In this paper, our goal is to outline a plausible scenario in which TOFT and SMT can be reconciled using the framework and concepts of the self-organized criticality (SOC), the principle proven to be extremely fruitful in a wide range of disciplines pertaining to natural phenomena, to biological communities, to large-scale social developments, to technological networks, and to many other subjects of research.35883648<SEP>Doris Wagner<SEP>Gene Alterations, Mediators, and Artificial Intelligence in Colorectal Liver Metastases<SEP>In this Special Issue of Cells, we seek articles that focus on the study of tumor biology in order to guide the scalpel [...].35820782<SEP>Kentaro Inamura<SEP>Cancer as microenvironmental, systemic and environmental diseases: opportunity for transdisciplinary microbiomics science<SEP>Cancer is generally regarded as a localised disease, with the well-established role of the tumour microenvironment. However, the realm of cancer goes beyond the tumour microenvironment, and cancer should also be regarded as a systemic and environmental disease. The exposome (ie, the totality of exposures), which encompasses diets, supplements, smoking, alcohol, other lifestyle factors, medications, etc, likely alters the microbiome (inclusive of bacteria, viruses, archaea, fungi, parasites, etc) and immune system in various body sites and influences tumour phenotypes. The systemic metabolic/inflammatory status, which is likely influenced by exposures and intestinal physiological changes, may affect tissue microenvironment of colorectum and any other organs. Germline genomic factors can modify disease phenotypes via gene-by-environment interactions. Although challenges exist, it is crucial to advance not only basic experimental research that can analyse the effects of exposures, microorganisms and microenvironmental components on tumour evolution but also interdisciplinary human population research that can dissect the complex pathogenic roles of the exposome, microbiome and immunome. Metagenomic, metatranscriptomic and metabolomic analyses should be integrated into well-designed population research combined with advanced methodologies of artificial intelligence and molecular pathological epidemiology. Ideally, a prospective cohort study design that enables biospecimen (such as stool) collection before disease detection should be considered to address reverse causation and recall biases. Robust experimental and observational research together can provide insights into dynamic interactions between environmental exposures, microbiota, tumour and immunity during carcinogenesis processes, thereby helping us develop precision prevention and therapeutic strategies to ultimately reduce the cancer burden.36629884<SEP>Tobias Jorg<SEP>[Interdisciplinary case discussions]<SEP>Background: Interdisciplinary case discussions, especially tumor conferences, represent a large part of the clinical radiologist's daily work. Radiology plays a key role in tumor conferences, since imaging findings have a direct influence on therapy decisions. Methods and objectives: This article discusses the requirements for the radiologist in preparing and conducting tumor conferences. Furthermore, the general conditions and forms of implementation of tumor conferences will be highlighted. Information technology (IT) tools for process automation and systems for assessing the course of tumor diseases will be presented. Results: Detailed preparation of tumor conferences and clear communication of findings is essential. The radiological expertise in tumor conferences often leads to changes or adjustments of initially planned therapies. In addition to traditional face-to-face meetings, hybrid solutions have become established for tumor conferences in which the core team is on site and other participants (external referring physicians, internal participants outside the core team) are connected via video conference. Various systems have been established for assessing the course of tumor diseases. Due to its broad applicability, RECIST 1.1. is the most widely used. IT tools enable previously marked lesions to be displayed over time in a matrix view (lesion tracking). Artificial intelligence (AI) can also be used to automatically detect lesions and assess their volumes. Conclusion: Preparing and conducting tumor conferences is time-consuming for radiologists. IT tools can automate and thus facilitate the processes. Hybrid solutions combining face-to-face meetings and video conferences make it easier for external referring physicians to present their patients in tumor conferences.",
    "answer": "Based on the context provided from the vector database, it seems that the connection between genetic factors and the risk of specific cancers can be examined from multiple angles, especially when considering the two contrasting theories of carcinogenesis: somatic mutation theory (SMT) and tissue organization field theory (TOFT).\n\nFirstly, from the perspective of SMT, genetic factors are central to the development of cancer; the theory posits that cancer arises due to DNA mutations in a single somatic cell. These mutations tend to predominantly affect genes that regulate cell growth and division, leading to uncontrolled proliferation. Therefore, individuals with certain germline (inherited) genetic mutations or who acquire somatic mutations may have an increased risk of developing specific cancers.\n\nOn the other hand, TOFT suggests that carcinogenesis is mainly a problem of disrupted tissue architecture and cell signaling. While DNA mutations do occur according to TOFT, they are seen as the consequence of larger, tissue-level disruptions. Although TOFT places less emphasis on genetic factors as the primary cause, genetics can still play a role\u2014indirectly influencing how the tissue responds to environmental insults, which may lead to mutations and cancer.\n\nExpanding on this understanding, the work by Doris Wagner discusses how artificial intelligence could help in studying tumor biology and possibly colorectal liver metastases. This could relate to genetic factors as AI can help analyze massive sets of genetic data to discover patterns and mutations associated with cancer risk and progression.\n\nKentaro Inamura's research emphasizes that cancer should be seen as a systemic and environmental disease, suggesting that the interplay between genetic factors (germline genomic factors), environmental exposures (exposome), microbiome dynamics, and the immune system is critical in cancer development. This highlights the complex interactions between inherited genetic susceptibilities and external environmental factors.\n\nLastly, Tobias Jorg's paper focuses on interdisciplinary case discussions in radiology, which, while not directly related to genetic factors, plays a crucial role in diagnosing, assessing, and planning treatment for cancers, which could be influenced by underlying genetic vulnerabilities.\n\nIn conclusion, genetic factors evidently play a considerable role in the risk of specific cancers, whether they are seen as the primary cause (SMT) or as a part of an intricate network of influences involving tissue organization, environmental exposures, and systemic changes (TOFT, exposome, and microbiome interactions). Importantly, understanding this multifaceted relationship can help in developing precision prevention and therapeutic strategies for cancer.",
