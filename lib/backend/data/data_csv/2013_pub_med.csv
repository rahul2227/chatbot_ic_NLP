24278995,CASK Disorders,Ute Moog,"Clinical characteristics: CASK disorders include a spectrum of phenotypes in both females and males. Two main types of clinical presentation are seen: Microcephaly with pontine and cerebellar hypoplasia (MICPCH), generally associated with pathogenic loss-of-function variants in CASKX-linked intellectual disability (XLID) with or without nystagmus, generally associated with hypomorphic CASK pathogenic variants MICPCH is typically seen in females with moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, progressive microcephaly with or without ophthalmologic anomalies, and sensorineural hearing loss. Most are able to sit independently; 20%-25% attain the ability to walk; language is nearly absent in most. Neurologic features may include axial hypotonia, hypertonia/spasticity of the extremities, and dystonia or other movement disorders. Nearly 40% have seizures by age ten years. Behaviors may include sleep disturbances, hand stereotypies, and self biting. MICPCH in males may occur with or without severe epileptic encephalopathy in addition to severe-to-profound developmental delay. When seizures are present they occur early and may be intractable. In individuals and families with milder (i.e., hypomorphic) pathogenic variants, the clinical phenotype is usually that of XLID with or without nystagmus and additional clinical features. Males have mild-to-severe intellectual disability, with or without nystagmus and other ocular features. Females typically have normal intelligence with some displaying mild-to-severe intellectual disability with or without ocular features. Diagnosis/testing: The diagnosis of a CASK disorder is established in a female who is heterozygous for a CASK pathogenic variant and in a male who is hemizygous for a CASK pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Rarely, affected males have a mosaic pathogenic variant. Management: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and includes standard management of developmental delay and intellectual disability issues; medication for seizures; nutritional support; use of physiotherapy; and treatment of abnormal vision or hearing loss. Genetic counseling: CASK disorders are inherited in an X-linked manner. Risk to the family members of a proband with a CASK disorder depends on the phenotype (i.e., MICPCH or XLID ± nystagmus) in the proband. MICPCH. Most affected females and males represent simplex cases (i.e., the only affected family member) and have the disorder as the result of a de novo CASK pathogenic variant. Because heterozygous females manifest the phenotype, an asymptomatic mother is unlikely to be heterozygous for the CASK pathogenic variant. If a proband represents a simplex case, the recurrence risk to sibs appears to be low but greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism.XLID ± nystagmus. The father of a male with a CASK disorder will not have the disorder nor will he be hemizygous for the CASK pathogenic variant. If a male is the only affected family member, the mother may be a heterozygote or the affected male may have a de novo pathogenic variant. In a family with more than one affected individual, the mother of an affected male is an obligate heterozygote. If the mother of the proband has a CASK pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%: males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will typically be asymptomatic but may have a range of manifestations. If the CASK pathogenic variant cannot be detected in maternal leukocyte DNA, the risk to sibs is greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the CASK pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing for a CASK disorder are possible."
25529590,WAIS-IV administration errors: effects of altered response requirements on Symbol Search and violation of standard surface-variety patterns on Block Design,Joseph J Ryan,"This study utilized a sample of 50 college students to assess the possibility that responding to the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) Symbol Search subtest items with an ""x"" instead of a ""single slash mark"" would affect performance. A second sample of 50 college students was used to assess the impact on WAIS-IV Block Design performance of presenting all the items with only red surfaces facing up. The modified Symbol Search and Block Design administrations yielded mean scaled scores and raw scores that did not differ significantly from mean scores obtained with standard administrations. Findings should not be generalized beyond healthy, well-educated young adults."
25529585,Apparently abnormal Wechsler Memory Scale index score patterns in the normal population,Roman Marcus Carrasco,"Interpretation of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Fourth Edition may involve examination of multiple memory index score contrasts and similar comparisons with Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition ability indexes. Standardization sample data suggest that 15-point differences between any specific pair of index scores are relatively uncommon in normal individuals, but these base rates refer to a comparison between a single pair of indexes rather than multiple simultaneous comparisons among indexes. This study provides normative data for the occurrence of multiple index score differences calculated by using Monte Carlo simulations and validated against standardization data. Differences of 15 points between any two memory indexes or between memory and ability indexes occurred in 60% and 48% of the normative sample, respectively. Wechsler index score discrepancies are normally common and therefore not clinically meaningful when numerous such comparisons are made. Explicit prior interpretive hypotheses are necessary to reduce the number of index comparisons and associated false-positive conclusions. Monte Carlo simulation accurately predicts these false-positive rates."
25284715,A longitudinal intergenerational analysis of executive functions during early childhood,Kimberly Cuevas,"Despite the importance of executive function (EF) in both clinical and educational contexts, the aetiology of individual differences in early childhood EF remains poorly understood. This study provides the first longitudinal intergenerational analysis of mother-child EF associations during early childhood. A group of children and their mothers (n = 62) completed age-appropriate EF tasks. Mother and child EFs were modestly correlated by 24 months of age, and this association was stable through 48 months. Importantly, maternal-child EF associations were still robust after controlling for verbal ability (potential indicator of verbal/crystallized intelligence) and maternal education (correlate of socio-economic status and verbal intelligence). Potential implications of these findings as well as underlying mechanisms of the maternal-child EF association (gene-environment interplay) are discussed."
25265311,The design organization test: further demonstration of reliability and validity as a brief measure of visuospatial ability,William D S Killgore,"Neuropsychological assessments are frequently time-consuming and fatiguing for patients. Brief screening evaluations may reduce test duration and allow more efficient use of time by permitting greater attention toward neuropsychological domains showing probable deficits. The Design Organization Test (DOT) was initially developed as a 2-min paper-and-pencil alternative for the Block Design (BD) subtest of the Wechsler scales. Although initially validated for clinical neurologic patients, we sought to further establish the reliability and validity of this test in a healthy, more diverse population. Two alternate versions of the DOT and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) were administered to 61 healthy adult participants. The DOT showed high alternate forms reliability (r = .90-.92), and the two versions yielded equivalent levels of performance. The DOT was highly correlated with BD (r = .76-.79) and was significantly correlated with all subscales of the WASI. The DOT proved useful when used in lieu of BD in the calculation of WASI IQ scores. Findings support the reliability and validity of the DOT as a measure of visuospatial ability and suggest its potential worth as an efficient estimate of intellectual functioning in situations where lengthier tests may be inappropriate or unfeasible."
25258654,A Practical Testing Battery to Measure Neurobehavioral Ability among Children with FASD,Wendy O Kalberg,"Aims: To determine a brief, practical battery of tests that discriminate between children with a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and unexposed controls. Design: Children received dysmorphology exams, a targeted battery of cognitive and behavioral tests, and their mothers were interviewed about maternal risk factors. Children diagnosed with an FASD and children unexposed to alcohol prenatally were compared on cognitive/behavioral test results. Setting: A community in The Western Cape Province of South Africa. Participants: Sixty-one, first grade children with FASD and 52 matched normal controls. Measures: Statistical analyses of maternal drinking behavior and their child's test performance. Findings: Self-reported maternal drinking patterns before during and after pregnancy were used to confirm prenatal exposures to alcohol in the group of children diagnosed with FASD. With this sample of children diagnosed with FASD and completely unexposed controls, the adverse effects of maternal drinking on children's performance are reported. Results of the battery of standardized cognitive and behavioral tests indicate highly significant differences (p ≤ .001) between groups on: intelligence, perceptual motor, planning, and logical, spatial, short term, long term, and working memory abilities. Furthermore, a binary logistical regression model of only 3 specific cognitive and behavioral tests, including Digit Span A+B (Wald = 4.10), Absurd Situation (Wald = 3.57), and Word Association (Wald = 4.30) correctly classified 79.1% of the child participants as FASD or controls. Conclusions: A brief, practical set of tests can discriminate children with and without FASD and provide useful information for interventions for affected children."
25076796,"Spatial, Temporal and Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Maritime Piracy",Elio Marchione,"Objectives: To examine patterns in the timing and location of incidents of maritime piracy to see whether, like many urban crimes, attacks cluster in space and time. Methods: Data for all incidents of maritime piracy worldwide recorded by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency are analyzed using time-series models and methods originally developed to detect disease contagion. Results: At the macro level, analyses suggest that incidents of pirate attacks are concentrated in five subregions of the earth's oceans and that the time series for these different subregions differ. At the micro level, analyses suggest that for the last 16 years (or more), pirate attacks appear to cluster in space and time suggesting that patterns are not static but are also not random. Conclusions: Much like other types of crime, pirate attacks cluster in space, and following an attack at one location the risk of others at the same location or nearby is temporarily elevated. The identification of such regularities has implications for the understanding of maritime piracy and for predicting the future locations of attacks."
25030251,Factors influencing post-traumatic stress in Korean forensic science investigators,Yang-Sook Yoo,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to understand factors that influence post-traumatic stress (PTS) in Korean forensic science investigators. Methods: A total of 111 forensic science investigators were recruited in Korea. PTS was measured using the tool modified by Choi (2001) from the original developed by Foa, Riggs, Dancu, and Rothbaum (1993) based on DSM-IV. Factors influencing PTS included demographic and job-related characteristics, emotional intelligence, and death anxiety. Results: PTS scores were positively correlated with personality type, fatigue from work, and death anxiety. PTS scores were negatively correlated with length of career as a forensic science investigator and emotional intelligence. The factors that had the greatest influence on PTS were death anxiety, years spent as a forensic science investigator, personality type, emotional intelligence, fatigue, and homicide experience. The explanatory power of these six factors was 44.0%. Conclusion: Therefore, it is necessary to regularly evaluate the mental health of those who are vulnerable to PTS. Based on these results, various interventions could be implemented for promoting overall health of the forensic science investigators."
25007536,The role of the jumping to conclusion bias in delusions formation],Jagoda Rózycka,"The results of many researches indicate that individuals with delusions reveal the reasoning bias. In probabilistic reasoning tasks they reveal hastiness in decision-making. The individuals with delusions request less information than non-deluded individuals, even if additional data is easily available. What is more, they also prove to be convinced to a greater extend of having made the right decision. This finding has been replicated by a number of studies. However, the previous researches have not confirmed the origins of 'jumping to conclusion' bias, and its role in the process of forming delusions has not been yet confirmed. The article in question contains the review of the results of the jumping to conclusion bias in people with delusions. It discusses the main hypotheses explaining the relations between the hasty decision making and the delusions formation. The article also deals with the specifics of 'jumping to conclusion' bias in case of individuals with delusions, as well as summarizes its relation to factors such as the level of intelligence or the intensity of delusion."
24990635,What my parents make me believe in learning: the role of filial piety in Hong Kong students' motivation and academic achievement,Wei-Wen Chen,"Chinese students are well-known for their academic excellence. However, studies that explore the underlying mechanism of how cultural factors relate to the motivational process and academic achievement of Chinese students have been limited. This study aimed to examine the role of filial piety in shaping Chinese students' theories of intelligence so as to obtain a clearer understanding of the process by which parent-child connectedness is linked to Chinese students' academic achievement. A sample of 312 university students in Hong Kong were assessed concerning their filial piety beliefs, theories of intelligence and academic achievement. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling. The results indicated that different filial piety beliefs relate to students' academic achievement by shaping different theories of intelligence. Reciprocal filial piety beliefs were found to facilitate an incremental view of intelligence, which in turn contributes to students' academic achievement. Authoritarian filial piety beliefs were shown to be associated with an entity view of intelligence, which consequently deteriorates students' academic achievement. Cultural views of motivational processes can shed light on how motivational beliefs are developed as a product of cultural or socialization processes, which, in turn, contribute to students' academic success."
24971291,"Spiritual intelligence, resiliency, and withdrawal time in clients of methadone maintenance treatment",Behnaz Shahbakhsh,"Background: Reports show an increasing interest in spirituality. It has been revealed that people with spiritual tendencies, can better deal with a trauma, manage the stressful situations, and have greater improvement in their health condition. Objectives: Our aim was to examine the relationship between spiritual intelligence and resiliency, and the relation of these two variables with the withdrawal time of individuals treated with methadone. Materials and methods: This research was conducted on patients referred to the addiction center of Baharan Psychiatric Hospital in Zahedan, Iran. Our sample included 100 referrals; they were provided with questionnaires and asked to answer them honestly. King's spiritual intelligence questionnaire and resilience questionnaires were used. Results: There were significant positive correlations between resiliency and scores of spiritual intelligence as well as with subscales of spiritual intelligence. In addition, there were significant positive correlations between withdrawal time and scores of spiritual intelligence as well as with subscales of spiritual intelligence as well as with resiliency. Conclusions: Relationships between the spiritual intelligence and resiliency parameters with withdrawal time show that these parameters can have a role in relapse protection among addicted people."
24943404,Why is intelligence associated with stability of happiness?,Satoshi Kanazawa,"In the National Child Development Study, life-course variability in happiness over 18 years was significantly negatively associated with its mean level (happier individuals were more stable in their happiness, and it was not due to the ceiling effect), as well as childhood general intelligence and all Big Five personality factors (except for Agreeableness). In a multiple regression analysis, childhood general intelligence was the strongest predictor of life-course variability in life satisfaction, stronger than all Big Five personality factors, including Emotional stability. More intelligent individuals were significantly more stable in their happiness, and it was not entirely because: (1) they were more educated and wealthier (even though they were); (2) they were healthier (even though they were); (3) they were more stable in their marital status (even though they were); (4) they were happier (even though they were); (5) they were better able to assess their own happiness accurately (even though they were); or (6) they were better able to recall their previous responses more accurately or they were more honest in their survey responses (even though they were both). While I could exclude all of these alternative explanations, it ultimately remained unclear why more intelligent individuals were more stable in their happiness."
24924230,Intrauterine environment and cognitive development in young twins,E E Antoniou,"Intrauterine factors important for cognitive development, such as birth weight, chorionicity and umbilical cord characteristics were investigated. A total of 663 twin pairs completed the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised and scores were available for Performance, Verbal and Total Intelligence Quotient (IQ). The intrauterine factors examined were birth weight, placental weight and morphology, cord knots, cord length and cord insertion. IQ scores for the varying levels of the intrauterine markers adjusting for gender and gestational age were calculated. The heritability of IQ and the association between IQ and intrauterine environment were examined. Twins with lower birth weight and cord knots had lower IQ scores. The aetiology of IQ is largely distinct from that of birth weight and cord knots, and non-shared environment may influence the observed relationships."
24829119,A meta-analysis of adult-rated child personality and academic performance in primary education,Arthur E Poropat,"Background: Personality is reliably associated with academic performance, but personality measurement in primary education can be problematic. Young children find it difficult to accurately self-rate personality, and dominant models of adult personality may be inappropriate for children. Aims: This meta-analysis was conducted to determine the validity of the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality for statistically predicting children's academic performance. Sample: Literature search identified 12 reports, with cumulative sample sizes ranging from 4,382 (19 correlations) to 5,706 (23 correlations) for correlations with Emotional Stability and Conscientiousness respectively. Method: Hunter-Schmidt random-effects meta-analysis was used, and moderators were tested using sample-weighted regression. Results: When compared with self-rated measures, adult-rated Conscientiousness and Openness were more strongly correlated with academic performance, but adult-rated Agreeableness was less strongly correlated. Q-set-based assessments had lower validity, which appeared to explain moderating effects of rating source. Moderating effects were not found for age, year of education (grades 1-7), or language within which the study was conducted. Conclusions: Conscientiousness and Openness had two of the strongest correlations with academic performance yet reported, comparable with previous meta-analytic correlations of academic performance with instructional quality, cognitive ability, and feedback. The FFM appears to be valid for educational research with children. Openness, which has no counterpart in models of children's temperament, should be further researched with children. Future research should examine the measurement of childhood personality, its relationship with intelligence, the extent to which it is malleable in primary education, and its causal relationship with academic performance."
24826496,Unreliable block span reveals simulated intellectual disability on the stanford-binet intelligence scales-fifth edition,Alyse Barker,"Previously developed validity measures are largely lacking in their ability to accurately distinguish malingerers from individuals with genuine intellectual disabilities (ID). The purpose of the present study was to develop a validity index for the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales-Fifth Edition (SB-5) aimed at detecting malingered ID. Fifty-four college students were instructed to feign impairment consistent with mental retardation while completing the SB-5. Simulated malingerers performed significantly poorer on the Block Span task of the SB-5 than did individuals with genuine impairment. A Block Span Validity Index (BSVI) cutoff score of less than 10 showed perfect specificity by correctly identifying all persons with true ID and demonstrated 52% sensitivity in identifying persons feigning impairment. For the detection of malingered ID, the BSVI yielded favorable results, although more research is needed to validate the BSVI using a known-groups study design."
24826491,Cold pressor-induced pain does not impair WAIS-IV processing speed index or working memory index performance,Joseph Etherton,"Chronic pain frequently involves cognitive complaints such as concentration and memory deficits, but studies of the effects of pain on cognition have not consistently demonstrated deficits and have not typically utilized standard neuropsychological instruments. Effects of cold pressor-induced pain on Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition Processing Speed Index (PSI) and Working Memory Index (WMI) performance was examined in nonclinical volunteers (n = 40). All took one PSI subtest and one WMI subtest normally, and then took different PSI and WMI subtests during cold pressor-induced pain or painless warm-water immersion. Scaled scores for normal administration versus pain or painless water immersion did not differ and there was no interaction between group (control vs. pain) and manner of administration, despite moderately severe mean pain ratings (M = 6.8 on a 0-10 pain-rating scale). Results indicate that induced pain in nonclinical volunteers does not impair PSI or WMI performance, and they suggest that chronic pain per se should not be expected to substantially affect these cognitive functions. However, patients with chronic pain may differ from nonclinical volunteers in their experience of pain, potentially limiting generalizability."
24821505,The cultural background of the non-academic concept of psychology in Japan: its implications for introductory education in psychology,Yuki Ashitaka,"No research has empirically explored the non-academic concept of psychology itself (implicit theories) in non-Western cultures despite a widely held belief that this understanding differs cross-culturally. This study examined whether the non-academic concept of psychology among inexperienced Japanese students differed from the concept held by students of other countries. In Japanese, psychology is referred to as , which includes the ideographic character , literally meaning heart. This fact led us to hypothesize that psychology will be disproportionately associated with emotion among Japanese students. Indeed, our findings among Japanese students produced a J-curve, indicating that our prediction was true. We posit that this issue has never been discussed in Japan because a majority of people share this concept of psychology. In our second study, we examined not only preference in students' association of intelligence or emotion but also heart or mind with psychology. Finally, we identified whether students' believe that psychology encompasses both the heart and the mind. We conclude with a discussion of the importance of explicitly defining the non-academic concept of psychology in early psychology education in Japan."
24808599,Ensemble learning in fixed expansion layer networks for mitigating catastrophic forgetting,Robert Coop,"Catastrophic forgetting is a well-studied attribute of most parameterized supervised learning systems. A variation of this phenomenon, in the context of feedforward neural networks, arises when nonstationary inputs lead to loss of previously learned mappings. The majority of the schemes proposed in the literature for mitigating catastrophic forgetting were not data driven and did not scale well. We introduce the fixed expansion layer (FEL) feedforward neural network, which embeds a sparsely encoding hidden layer to help mitigate forgetting of prior learned representations. In addition, we investigate a novel framework for training ensembles of FEL networks, based on exploiting an information-theoretic measure of diversity between FEL learners, to further control undesired plasticity. The proposed methodology is demonstrated on a basic classification task, clearly emphasizing its advantages over existing techniques. The architecture proposed can be enhanced to address a range of computational intelligence tasks, such as regression problems and system control."
24799770,Genetic and Environmental Influences on Cognition Across Development and Context,Elliot M Tucker-Drob,"Genes account for between approximately 50% and 70% of the variation in cognition at the population level. However, population-level estimates of heritability potentially mask marked subgroup differences. We review the body of empirical evidence indicating that (a) genetic influences on cognition increase from infancy to adulthood, and (b) genetic influences on cognition are maximized in more advantaged socioeconomic contexts (i.e., a Gene × Socioeconomic Status interaction). We discuss potential mechanisms underlying these effects, particularly transactional models of cognitive development. Transactional models predict that people in high-opportunity contexts actively evoke and select positive learning experiences on the basis of their genetic predispositions; these learning experiences, in turn, reciprocally influence cognition. The net result of this transactional process is increasing genetic influence with increasing age and increasing environmental opportunity."
24791121,Development of visual-motor perception in pupils with expressive writing disorder and pupils without expressive writing disorder: a comparative statistical analysis,Tahereh Mesrahi,"Background: Learning disability is one of the most noticed subjects for behavioral specialists. Most of thelearning difficulties are caused by senso-motor development and neurological organization. The main purposeof the present research is to examine the role of delayed perceptual-motor development and brain damage inorigination of expressive writing disorder (EWD). Methods: The studied sample is 89 pupils divided into two groups, one of which is pupils with expressivewriting disorder (n=43) and the other is pupils without expressive writing disorder (n=46), consisted of secondand third grade elementary school students. First of all, students with EWD are selected through dictation testand intelligence test, and then the two groups, students with and without EWD, would take the Bender Gestalttest. The average score of perceptual visual-motor development and brain damage of two groups is comparedusing T test for independent groups and χ2 test. Results: Results show that there is a significant difference in perceptual visual-motor development betweenstudents with EWD and students without EWD (p<0.01). Based on the results, perceptual-motor development ofstudents with EWD is lower than students without EWD. There is no significant difference in brain damagebetween those with EWD and healthy people, (p> 0.05). Conclusion: Based on our findings it could be concluded that those who are relatively more developed thantheir peers, in terms of visual-motor perception, are more successful in education, especially in expressive writing."
24761321,Computational Intelligence and Game Design for Effective At-Home Stroke Rehabilitation,Nunzio Alberto Borghese,"Objective: The aim of this article is to describe a game engine that has all the characteristics needed to support rehabilitation at home. The low-cost tracking devices recently introduced in the entertainment market allow measuring reliably at home, in real time, players' motion with a hands-free approach. Such systems have also become a source of inspiration for researchers working in rehabilitation. Computer games appear suited to guide rehabilitation because of their ability to engage the users. However, commercial videogames and game engines lack the peculiar functionalities required in rehabilitation: Games should be adapted to each patient's functional status, and monitoring the patient's motion is mandatory to avoid maladaptation. Feedback on performance and progression of the exercises should be provided. Lastly, several tracking devices should be considered, according to the patient's pathology and rehabilitation aims. Subjects and methods: We have analyzed the needs of the clinicians and of the patients associated in performing rehabilitation at home, identifying the characteristics that the game engine should have. Results: The result of this analysis has led us to develop the Intelligent Game Engine for Rehabilitation (IGER) system, which combines the principles upon which commercial games are designed with the needs of rehabilitation. IGER is heavily based on computational intelligence: Adaptation of the difficulty level of the exercise is carried out through a Bayesian framework from the observation of the patient's success rate. Monitoring is implemented in fuzzy systems and based on rules defined for the exercises by clinicians. Several devices can be attached to IGER through an input abstraction layer, like the Nintendo® (Kyoto, Japan) Wii™ Balance Board™, the Microsoft® (Redmond, WA) Kinect, the Falcon from Novint Technologies (Albuquerque, NM), or the Tyromotion (Graz, Austria) Timo® plate balance board. IGER is complemented with videogames embedded in a specific taxonomy developed to support rehabilitation progression through time. Conclusions: A few games aimed at postural rehabilitation have been designed and developed to test the functionalities of the IGER system. The preliminary results of tests on normal elderly people and patients with the supervision of clinicians have shown that the IGER system indeed does feature the characteristics required to support rehabilitation at home and that it is ready for clinical pilot testing at patients' homes."
24758443,"Emotional intelligence, perceived stress and burnout among resident doctors: an assessment of the relationship",M K Swami,"Background: Burnout is an increasing problem among the medical fraternity, especially resident doctors. We assessed the relationship between burnout, emotional intelligence and perceived stress in an attempt to explore a probable solution. Methods: Residents in the departments of medicine (n=29) and surgery (n=27) were assessed with a specially designed proforma consisting of participant's profile sheet, Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM), Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Correlation and mediational analysis were used to analyse the data. Results: The findings showed a positive correlation of burnout with perceived stress and a negative correlation with trait emotional intelligence (EI). Perceived stress also showed a negative correlation with trait EI. Mediation analysis showed that perceived stress mediates the effect of trait EI on burnout. Conclusion: Enhancing EI through training may be an important intervention for targeting burnout."
24754811,"Intelligence, gender, and assessment method affect the accuracy of self-estimated intelligence",Sophie von Stumm,"Self-estimates of intelligence (SEI), which influence to what extent people engage in and how well they perform at a task, are subject to distortion. Here, the distortion effects of individual differences in intelligence (IQ), gender, and proximal (with reference to test performance) and distal (with reference to IQ score distributions) assessments of SEI were tested in a sample of 200 British adults. The results showed that (1) people with lower IQ misestimated their SEI to a greater extent than people with high IQ; (2) this effect was more pronounced in distal than proximal measures of SEI; (3) SEI means did not differ significantly across gender but the IQ-related level of SEI distortion did; (4) this effect was greater for distal than proximal measurement; and (5) proximal SEI were on average less distorted than distal SEI scores and also correlated more closely with IQ. Overall, the findings suggest that the distal SEI assessment method resulted in greater gender- and IQ-related distortions of SEI."
24754807,Sub-threshold autism traits: the role of trait emotional intelligence and cognitive flexibility,Elif Gökçen,"Theory and research suggests that features of autism are not restricted to individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and that autism-like traits vary throughout the general population at lower severities. The present research first investigated the relationship of autism traits with trait emotional intelligence and empathy in a sample of 163 adults aged between 18 and 51 years (44% male). It then examined performance on a set of tasks assessing social cognition and cognitive flexibility in 69 participants with either high or low scores on ASD traits. Results confirm that there is pronounced variation within the general population relating to ASD traits, which reflect similar (though less severe) social-cognitive and emotional features to those observed in ASDs."
24744452,"Associations between cortical thickness and general intelligence in children, adolescents and young adults",Kyle Menary,"Neuroimaging research indicates that human intellectual ability is related to brain structure including the thickness of the cerebral cortex. Most studies indicate that general intelligence is positively associated with cortical thickness in areas of association cortex distributed throughout both brain hemispheres. In this study, we performed a cortical thickness mapping analysis on data from 182 healthy typically developing males and females ages 9 to 24 years to identify correlates of general intelligence (g) scores. To determine if these correlates also mediate associations of specific cognitive abilities with cortical thickness, we regressed specific cognitive test scores on g scores and analyzed the residuals with respect to cortical thickness. The effect of age on the association between cortical thickness and intelligence was examined. We found a widely distributed pattern of positive associations between cortical thickness and g scores, as derived from the first unrotated principal factor of a factor analysis of Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) subtest scores. After WASI specific cognitive subtest scores were regressed on g factor scores, the residual score variances did not correlate significantly with cortical thickness in the full sample with age covaried. When participants were grouped at the age median, significant positive associations of cortical thickness were obtained in the older group for g-residualized scores on Block Design (a measure of visual-motor integrative processing) while significant negative associations of cortical thickness were observed in the younger group for g-residualized Vocabulary scores. These results regarding correlates of general intelligence are concordant with the existing literature, while the findings from younger versus older subgroups have implications for future research on brain structural correlates of specific cognitive abilities, as well as the cognitive domain specificity of behavioral performance correlates of normative gray matter thinning during adolescence."
24720233,Emotional competence (intelligence) and vocational choice among candidates for the ordained ministry,Richard A Hunt,"This research examined the ways in which vocational interests of United Methodist candidates for ordained ministry are related to Emotional Competence (EC) as measured by Inventory of Religious Activities and Interests (IRAI) ministry interests and 16PF personality scales. Results show two primary clusters of ministry interests that are related to EC. Recommendations include ways that supervisors, mentors, and pastor-staff-parish relations committees can use this information to enable pastors to grow in their EC skills."
24695779,Effects of Medhya Rasayana and Yogic practices in improvement of short-term memory among school-going children,Atul Shankar Sarokte,"Excellent memory, extraordinary intelligence, great academic achievement, and successful career are the dreams of every individual in this era of competition and professionalism. A good memory power acts as a catalyst in all walks of life, be it academic success or maintenance of personal relationships. It is observed that an average man uses only 10% of his natural memory. Remaining 90% is left unused in a haphazard manner. As per the American psychologist Carl Emil Seashore, if one is alert and makes systematic attempts to awaken and use the natural memory properly, his/her natural memory would be activated creatively and would offer benefits of higher order. A comparative study was conducted comprising 90 subjects to know the efficacy of Medhya Rasayana and Yogic practices in short-term memory of school-going children. The study was conducted over a period of 3 months. It was an open, prospective, and randomized clinical study. The subjects of group A formed the control group and they were observed silently for 3 months without any intervention. The subjects in group B were administered with Choorna (powder) of four Medhya Rasayanas, Mandukaparni (Centella asiatica Linn.), Yashtimadhu (Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn.), Guduchi [Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers ex Hook. f. and Thoms.], and Sankhapushpi (Convolvulus pluricaulis Choisy), at a dose of 2 g twice daily with milk. Subjects belonging to group C were advocated regular Yogic practices of Asanas, Pranayama, and Dhyana. Further study revealed that among the three groups, group B treated with Medhya Rasayana showed highly significant and most effective changes with respect to objective parameters in the tests, i.e. (1) short-term memory test pictures and (2) serial recall effects test using memory scope. Among the three groups, group C treated with Yogic practices showed highly significant and most effective changes with respect to subjective and objective parameters in mini mental status scale i.e. test 3. The treatment is cost effective and devoid of side effects, which can be beneficial for the community. Mean increase after first follow-up in group B was higher as compared to group C. This shows that Medhya Rasayanas are quick in action and bring about improvement in memory faster when compared with Yogic practices. So, on the whole, group B can be considered to be the most efficient among the three groups."
24693814,Ammons quick test validity among randomly selected referrals,Robert John Zagar,"After selection using a random number table, from volunteer referrals, 89 Youth (61 boys, 28 girls; 48 African Americans, 2 Asian Americans, 27 Euro-Americans, 12 Hispanic Americans), and 147 Adults (107 men, 40 women; 11 African Americans, 6 Asian Americans, 124 Euro-Americans, 6 Hispanic Americans) were administered the Ammons Quick Test (QT). Means, confidence intervals, standard deviations, and Pearson product-moment correlations among tests were computed. The Ammons QT was moderately to strongly and significantly correlated statistically with: the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-3b (PPVT-3b); the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-2 Parent/Teacher Form; the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-4) or the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-4); and the Wide Range Achievement Test-Fourth Edition (WRAT-4) Blue and Green Forms. After 51 years, the original norms for the Ammons QT remain valid measures of receptive vocabulary, verbal intelligence, and auditory information processing useful to clinicians."
24683760,Effect of structured teaching programme on the knowledge and opinion of nursing students towards prevention of mental retardation,Kalyani Moharana,"Mental retardation is a condition of arrested or incomplete development of mind which is characterised by impairment of skills manifested during the developmental period that contribute to the level of intelligence that is cognitive, language, motor and social abilities (WHO). A quasi experimental study was conducted at College of Nursing, NIMHANS, Bangalore with the objective to assess the effectiveness of structured teaching programme on the level of knowledge & opinion of nursing students towards primary prevention of mental retardation. The 44, 3rd yr BSc nursing students were selected by purposive sampling design. Self administered knowledge questionnaire and opinion scale were used as tools. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of four domains: concept, prenatal, intranatal, postnatal causes and prevention of mental retardation. Opinion scale was prepared as statement. The scale was divided into two domains positive and negatively worded. The interpretation was: higher the score, higher the positive opinion. The score ranging from 30-75 were negative, 76-90 neutral and 91-150 as positive opinion. This study revealed that knowledge score of the subjects were significantly increased at p-value 0.001. Opinion score, analysed using McNamer's chi-square test, indicated that a significant change occurred after structured teaching programme. It is concluded that structured teaching programme seems to be highly effective in improving knowledge and opinion towards primary prevention of mental disorders."
24649464,Benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes: to treat or not to treat,Soonhak Kwon,"Background and purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits and risks of oxcarbazepine (OXC) monotherapy in children with newly diagnosed, benign partial epilepsy based on clinico-electrical and neuropsychological evaluation over time. Methods: The study was open label, prospective, multicenter based. A total of 39 children with BRE were involved in the study. They were randomized into two groups (T; treatment with OXC, NT; No treatment) to compare the effectiveness of OXC treatment. All children underwent EEGs with quantification and a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests at the first visit and follow up visit at 6 months. Results: The subjects made a slight progress in general intelligence measures over time in both groups (95.4±10.5 to 97.6±7.5 for T, 107.6±17.3 to 111.4±18.6 for NT). Memory and frontal executive functions did not change over time in both groups in terms of the memory quotient (MQ) (106.7±27.5 to 103.4± 19.3 for T, 105.8±13.2 to 104.9±17.2 for NT) and executive intelligence quotient (EIQ) (114.7±18.3 to 108.9±12.5 for T, 100.6±25.1 to 101.2±13.9 for NT). However, when sub-domain scores were compared between the two groups, the treatment group got significantly worse over time in the verbal fluency test (11.5±3.8 to 8.0±1.4 for T, 10.3±3.9 to 11.5±2.1 for NT; p<0.05) and level 1 of Stroop test (9.3±3.0 to 7.5±1.3 for T, 11.0±3.7 to 11.2±2.6 for NT; p<0.05). The subjects might have cognitive and behavioral difficulties in association with frontal lobe dysfunctions, but these difficulties did not seem to be dependent on the number of seizures, the abundance of subclinical epileptiform discharges, or the anti-epileptic treatment. Conclusions: We think that OXC monotherapy is effective for children with BRE, but is to be given to the selected patients such as patients with prolonged or frequent seizures. However, further studies are needed to have a better understanding in this matter."
24645995,α-1 antitrypsin and chronic fatigue syndrome: a case study from pathophysiology to clinical practice,José Alegre,"SUMMARY Background: Several lines of evidence support the involvement of inflammatory and immunologic abnormalities in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Since recent studies have shown that α-1 antitrypsin (AAT) possesses anti-inflammatory properties, the potential therapeutic effect of AAT treatment on CFS has been investigated. Case presentation: A 49-year-old woman diagnosed with CFS was treated with intravenous infusions of a human plasma-derived AAT concentrate (60 mg/kg body weight weekly for 8 consecutive weeks). The patient's monocyte elastase, a regulator of inflammatory processes, was 1170 U/mg. At completion of treatment, improvement in maximal workload was observed (54.0-71.7% of predicted). Additionally, amelioration in working memory (scores: 83-94) and perceptual organization (scores: 75-83) were detected on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III test. Monocyte elastase decreased to a normal range (<150 U/mg). Improvement in functional capacity allowed the patient to work in part-time employment. Conclusion: These findings suggest a possible role for AAT in the treatment of CFS."
24644508,"Effectiveness of EEG-Biofeedback on Attentiveness, Working Memory and Quantitative Electroencephalography on Reading Disorder",Elnaz Mosanezhad Jeddi,"Objective: Cognitive factors are the important correlates of reading disorder and their impairments are established in children with reading disorder. Neurofeedback as an intervention has been reported to be useful in improvement of cognitive deficits. The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of this treatment on attentiveness and working memory and related electroencephalographic (EEG) changes in children with reading disorder. Methods: In this single subject study, six children with reading disorder aged 8-10 years old completed twenty 30-minunt sessions of treatment. Continuous performance task, the digit span subscale of the 3(rd) edition of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) and quantitative electroencephalography were used to evaluate the changes at pre and post-treatment. The data were evaluated by visual inspection of the graph, the mean percentage improvement and signal detection measures. Results: The results showed improvements in attention and working memory. Furthermore, EEG analysis did not show notable changes in the power of the targeted bands (delta, theta, and beta), rather the normalization of coherence was explicit in theta band at T3-T4, delta band at Cz-Fz, beta band at Cz-Fz, Cz-Pz and Cz-C4. Conclusions: These significant changes in coherence are possible indications of the connectivity between frontal and posterior association and integration between sensory and motor areas that explain the improvements in attention and working memory. Declaration of interest: None."
24633271,Factors affecting interest in respiratory medicine as a subspecialty of choice: survey of internal medicine residents in Nigeria,O O Desalu,"Aims and objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the factors that affect the interest in respiratory medicine (RM) as a subspecialty of choice among internal medicine residents in Nigeria. Subjects, materials and methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 136 internal medicine residents recruited from seven teaching hospitals from January 2011 to June 2011. A semi-structured questionnaire that was self administered by residents was used to obtain socio-demographic information and factors affecting residents' interest in respiratory medicine. Results: Out of 136 residents that completed the study, 78 (57.4 %) were junior residents (PG year 1-3) and 58(42.6%) were senior residents (PG year >3). Thirty four (43.6%) junior residents and 21(36.2%) senior residents considered respiratory medicine as a sub-specialty of choice. Only 2(3.5%) of the senior residents were presently committed to RM. In the junior residents, interest in respiratory medicine was correlated with personal intelligence and ability (RR=2.58, ;95% confidence interval(CI): 1.16-7.07, p-0.01) , availability of respiratory physician (RR=2.42; 95% CI 1.07-7.63 ,p-0.02) and postgraduate examiners in RM in training institutions RR= (2.20; 95% CI 1.06-5.45,p-0.03), experience during rotation in medical school and residency (RR=2.11 ; 95% CI 1.11-4.21,p-0.03) and future annual income (RR=2.04;C:I1.03-4.68,p-0.04). In the senior residents, interest in RM was correlated with the availability of postgraduate examiners in RM in training institutions (RR- 6.36; 95% CI 1.16-66.80, P-<0.01), future opportunity for scholarships and travel grants (RR- 4.23; 95% CI 1.19-25.92,p-< 0.01), personal intelligence and ability (RR= 3.41; 95% CI.16-13.87,p-0.01) and prospect for rapid elevation in career (RR=2.92; 95% CI 1.03-11.91,p -0.04). Provisions of modern facilities in training institutions, mentoring by senior colleagues and promotion of subspecialty by respiratory physicians were rated by the senior residents as the most important ways of increasing interest in respiratory medicine and making it a specialty of choice. Conclusion: The interest in respiratory medicine among internal medicine residents is low and decline as their level of training advances. The factors affecting the interest in respiratory medicine have been highlighted and the policy makers need to understand, and if possible modify these factors by formulating appropriate changes to our training programs so as to increase future numbers of respiratory physician."
24630325,A collaborative approach for incorporating forensic case data into crime investigation using criminal intelligence analysis and visualisation,Quentin Rossy,"There is an increasing awareness that the articulation of forensic science and criminal investigation is critical to the resolution of crimes. However, models and methods to support an effective collaboration between the partners are still poorly expressed or even lacking. Three propositions are borrowed from crime intelligence methods in order to bridge this gap: (a) the general intelligence process, (b) the analyses of investigative problems along principal perspectives: entities and their relationships, time and space, quantitative aspects and (c) visualisation methods as a mode of expression of a problem in these dimensions. Indeed, in a collaborative framework, different kinds of visualisations integrating forensic case data can play a central role for supporting decisions. Among them, link-charts are scrutinised for their abilities to structure and ease the analysis of a case by describing how relevant entities are connected. However, designing an informative chart that does not bias the reasoning process is not straightforward. Using visualisation as a catalyser for a collaborative approach integrating forensic data thus calls for better specifications."
24630282,Long-term neurocognitive outcome and quality of life in pediatric acute disseminated encephalomyelitis,Agnese Suppiej,"Background: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is an inflammatory-demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system usually with a monophasic course and a favorable neurological outcome. Long-term neurocognitive sequelae and quality of life have not yet been fully investigated. Aim: To examine neurocognitive outcome and quality of life in pediatric monophasic acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Methods: Of the 36 patients diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis at our institution, six were lost to follow-up and eight relapsed (two with multiphasic forms and six with multiple sclerosis). The outcome of the 22 remaining patients was evaluated using four subscales of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for estimation of IQ, a battery of neuropsychological tests, and semistructured and PedsQL questionnaires for quality of life. The effect of age at onset, neuroradiological recovery, and time elapsed from the acute event on outcome was also investigated. Results: Estimated IQ, neuropsychological mean group scores, and quality of life at follow-up were within the normal range, but 23% of the patients had pathological scores in various neuropsychological functions, among which attention was the most clearly affected. The neuroradiological recovery was not correlated with the result of the neuropsychological tests. Age at onset correlated with linguistic skills, whereas the time elapsed from the acute event had a significant effect on attention tasks: scores were worse in the group of patients with a follow-up shorter than 7 years. Conclusion: Our results suggest that pediatric monophasic acute disseminated encephalomyelitis has a favorable neurocognitive outcome. Patients with longer follow-up had a better outcome, suggesting a neurocognitive course that is different from that of multiple sclerosis and a potential for long-term recovery of affected functions."
24597444,National intelligence estimates and the Failed State Index,Martin Voracek,"Across 177 countries around the world, the Failed State Index, a measure of state vulnerability, was reliably negatively associated with the estimates of national intelligence. Psychometric analysis of the Failed State Index, compounded of 12 social, economic, and political indicators, suggested factorial unidimensionality of this index. The observed correspondence of higher national intelligence figures to lower state vulnerability might arise through these two macro-level variables possibly being proxies of even more pervasive historical and societal background variables that affect both."
24597373,"Consent, competence and lies to children: veracity in paediatric care",Maeve McMurdo,"Principles of consent and autonomy based on adult-oriented bioethics must be modified to take account of the cognitive development occurring in childhood. That development differentially affects executive and more theoretical intelligence and is greatly influenced by experience. Thus, a judgment about a matter of degree is required by clinicians dealing with children, particularly when children diverge from the choices that would be endorsed by the adults and clinicians surrounding them. If we accept that partnership and the evolution of consent away from a formal procedure are both indicative of current ethical and medico-legal thinking, then it follows that the involvement of a child in an open-ended conversation taking account of the realistic prospects and the subjective experiences associated with treatment is the right way to proceed and that it should reflect the ability of the child to understand what is at stake and how it will affect her or him. That carries implications for the child's access to adequate information about the condition, the treatment, and the decisions being made."
24597009,Emotional intelligence as a noncognitive factor in student registered nurse anesthetists,Shawn Collins,"Current nurse anesthesia program admissions requirements usually focus on high grade point averages, Graduate Record Examination scores, number of years of acute care experience, and a personal interview to assist in predicting those who will succeed in these intensive academic and clinical programs. Some people believe these criteria may not be sufficient in predicting success and have suggested that the use of noncognitive criteria such as emotional intelligence measurements may be helpful. The purpose of this cross-sectional correlational study was to explore the relationship between emotional intelligence and academic factors of student registered nurse anesthetists at 3 points in a program--matriculation, at 1 year of study, and in the last semester of study--and the relationship of these to clinical scores and National Certification Examination scores. An ex post facto cross-sectional study design was used to gather data at 3 critical times in nurse anesthesia programs to explore the relationships between emotional intelligence scores, preadmission demographics, clinical scores, and National Certification Examination scores. The online Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test instrument provided 15 individual emotional intelligence scores for each subject. The statistical relationship between variables was examined."
24592460,A survey on ambient-assisted living tools for older adults,Parisa Rashidi,"In recent years, we have witnessed a rapid surge in assisted living technologies due to a rapidly aging society. The aging population, the increasing cost of formal health care, the caregiver burden, and the importance that the individuals place on living independently, all motivate development of innovative-assisted living technologies for safe and independent aging. In this survey, we will summarize the emergence of 'ambient-assisted living"" (AAL) tools for older adults based on ambient intelligence paradigm. We will summarize the state-of-the-art AAL technologies, tools, and techniques, and we will look at current and future challenges."
24591081,Genome-wide copy number scan identifies disruption of PCDH11X in developmental dyslexia,Avinash M Veerappa,"Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a complex heritable disorder with unexpected difficulty in learning to read and spell despite adequate intelligence, education, environment, and normal senses. We performed a whole genome copy number variations (CNV) scan on 11 dyslexic families consisting of 14 dyslexic subjects and 24 non dyslexic members using 1.8 million combined SNP and CNV markers. We found CNVs affecting protocadherin genes in six dyslexics from three families, while none among the non-dyslexic control members showed any CNV in protocadherins. We identified duplications in five cases and a deletion in one case in Xq21.3 region bearing PCDH11X. Unequal recombination between the X-transposed region (XTR) of Yp11.2 and the X chromosome might be causing these structural changes. PCDH11X, expressed in brain is implicated in cell-cell communication, verbal ability, cerebral asymmetry, and dendritic synaptic plasticity, may be regarded as a new candidate gene for dyslexia."
24579285,Emotional intelligence subscales: are they correlated with child anxiety and behavior in the dental setting?,Naser Asl Aminabadi,"Objectives: The present study aimed at evaluating the correlation between emotional intelligence subscales and childs anxiety and behavior in the dental setting. Study design: The study included 123 children aged 7-12 years, who were scheduled to attend two consecutive sessions. In the first session, the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory: Youth Version (Bar-on EQ-I: YV) was administered to participants. The anxiety and behavior in children was evaluated during similar dental procedures in the second session using the Clinical Anxiety Rating Scale and the Frankl scale, respectively. Results: 23 children were eliminated from the study, leaving 100 participants (47 boys and 53 girls) with a mean age of 9.32 +/- 1.59 years for study. There were statistically significant positive correlations between Frankl score and EQ total score (p < 0.001), interpersonal scale (p < 0.001), intrapersonal scale (p < 0.001), stress management (p = 0.03) and adaptability scale (p < 0.001). Significant negative correlations were found between anxiety score and, EQ total score (p < 0.001), interpersonal scale (p < 0.001), intrapersonal scale (p < 0.001), and adaptability scale (p < 0.001). Anxiety and stress management were not correlated (p = 0.16). Total EQ and EQ subscales can predict significance variance of Frankl score (p < 0.05) and anxiety score (p < 0.05) without confounding effect of age and sex (p > 0.05). Conclusions: The results provide evidence that children with higher total EQ as well as higher scores of intrapersonal, interpersonal, adaptability and stress management scales can generally be flexible and effective in coping in the dental setting. Higher score in stress management subscale seems to be related to better control over affective information including anxiety compared with other subscales in stressful situations. Overall, they behave and cooperate better than children with lower scores."
24565439,A data-driven acute inflammation therapy,Vladan Radosavljevic,"Acute inflammation is a severe medical condition defined as an inflammatory response of the body to an infection. Its rapid progression requires quick and accurate decisions from clinicians. Inadequate and delayed decisions makes acute inflammation the 10th leading cause of death overall in United States with the estimated cost of treatment about $17 billion annually. However, despite the need, there are limited number of methods that could assist clinicians to determine optimal therapies for acute inflammation. We developed a data-driven method for suggesting optimal therapy by using machine learning model that is learned on historical patients' behaviors. To reduce both the risk of failure and the expense for clinical trials, our method is evaluated on a virtual patients generated by a mathematical model that emulates inflammatory response. In conducted experiments, acute inflammation was handled with two complimentary pro- and anti-inflammatory medications which adequate timing and doses are crucial for the successful outcome. Our experiments show that the dosage regimen assigned with our data-driven method significantly improves the percentage of healthy patients when compared to results by other methods used in clinical practice and found in literature. Our method saved 88% of patients that would otherwise die within a week, while the best method found in literature saved only 73% of patients. At the same time, our method used lower doses of medications than alternatives. In addition, our method achieved better results than alternatives when only incomplete or noisy measurements were available over time as well as it was less affected by therapy delay. The presented results provide strong evidence that models from the artificial intelligence community have a potential for development of personalized treatment strategies for acute inflammation."
24563565,Intelligence indexes generalist genes for cognitive abilities,Maciej Trzaskowski,"Twin research has supported the concept of intelligence (general cognitive ability, g) by showing that genetic correlations between diverse tests of verbal and nonverbal cognitive abilities are greater than 0.50. That is, most of the genes that affect cognitive abilities are highly pleiotropic in the sense that genes that affect one cognitive ability affect all cognitive abilities. The impact of this finding may have been blunted because it depends on the validity of the twin method. Although the assumptions of the twin method have survived indirect tests, it is now possible to test findings from the twin method directly using DNA alone in samples of unrelated individuals, without the assumptions of the twin method. We applied this DNA method, implemented in a software package called Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA), to estimate genetic variance and covariance for two verbal tests and two nonverbal tests using 1.7 million DNA markers genotyped on 2500 unrelated children at age 12; 1900 children also had cognitive data and DNA at age 7. Because each of these individuals is one member of a twin pair, we were able to compare GCTA estimates directly to twin study estimates using the same measures in the same sample. At age 12, GCTA confirmed the results of twin research in showing substantial genetic covariance between verbal and nonverbal composites. The GCTA genetic correlation at age 12 was 1.0 (SE = 0.32), not significantly different from the twin study estimate of 0.60 (SE = 0.09). At age 7, the genetic correlations were 0.31 (SE =0.32) from GCTA and 0.71 (SE = 0.15).from twin analysis. The results from the larger sample and stronger measures at age 12 confirm the twin study results that the genetic architecture of intelligence is driven by pleiotropic effects on diverse cognitive abilities. However, the results at age 7 and the large standard errors of GCTA bivariate genetic correlations suggest the need for further research with larger samples."
24561387,Quantitative multi-modal MRI of the Hippocampus and cognitive ability in community-dwelling older subjects,Benjamin S Aribisala,"Hippocampal structural integrity is commonly quantified using volumetric measurements derived from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Previously reported associations with cognitive decline have not been consistent. We investigate hippocampal integrity using quantitative MRI techniques and its association with cognitive abilities in older age. Participants from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 underwent brain MRI at mean age 73 years. Longitudinal relaxation time (T1), magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were measured in the hippocampus. General factors of fluid-type intelligence (g), cognitive processing speed (speed) and memory were obtained at age 73 years, as well as childhood IQ test results at age 11 years. Amongst 565 older adults, multivariate linear regression showed that, after correcting for ICV, gender and age 11 IQ, larger left hippocampal volume was significantly associated with better memory ability (β = .11, p = .003), but not with speed or g. Using quantitative MRI and after correcting for multiple testing, higher T1 and MD were significantly associated with lower scores of g (β range = -.11 to -.14, p < .001), speed (β range = -.15 to -.20, p < .001) and memory (β range = -.10 to -.12, p < .001). Higher MTR and FA in the hippocampus were also significantly associated with higher scores of g (β range = .17 to .18, p < .0001) and speed (β range = .10 to .15, p < .0001), but not memory. Quantitative multi-modal MRI assessments were more sensitive at detecting cognition-hippocampal integrity associations than volumetric measurements, resulting in stronger associations between MRI biomarkers and age-related cognition changes."
24558740,Robots and intellectual property],Jacques Larrieu,"This topic is part of the global issue concerning the necessity to adapt intellectual property law to constant changes in technology. The relationship between robots and IP is dual. On one hand, the robots may be regarded as objects of intellectual property. A robot, like any new machine, could qualify for a protection by a patent. A copyright may protect its appearance if it is original. Its memory, like a database, could be covered by a sui generis right. On the other hand, the question of the protection of the outputs of the robot must be raised. The robots, as the physical embodiment of artificial intelligence, are becoming more and more autonomous. Robot-generated works include less and less human inputs. Are these objects created or invented by a robot copyrightable or patentable? To whom the ownership of these IP rights will be allocated? To the person who manufactured the machine ? To the user of the robot? To the robot itself? All these questions are worth discussing."
24558738,Do androids need a legal status?],Xavier Bioy,"The existence of the subject of law is not an automatic allocation when the will and the autonomy are awarded, but a tool conferred by the legal system in order to protect the humanity (based on the presupposition of a consciousness that the human being remains to be the only one to have and to suppose at the others). He cannot involve thus of reducing the question of the status of the android to the simple recognition of an intelligence, besides artificial, but of denying the reasoning by analogy any real impact for the existence of a legal status. If specific status there would be, it will be only because the human being will have decided on it for his own legally protected interest. The status of the android will be metonymical, by inclusion in that of the human person, or will not be."
24558735,Robot companions and ethics a pragmatic approach of ethical design,Gérard Cornet,"From his experience as ethical expert for two Robot Companion prototype projects aiming at empowering older MCI persons to remain at home and to support their family carers, Gerard Cornet, Gerontologist, review the ethical rules, principles and pragmatic approaches in different cultures. The ethical process of these two funded projects, one European, Companionable (FP7 e-inclusion call1), the other French, Quo vadis (ANR tecsan) are described from the inclusion of the targeted end users in the process, to the assessment and ranking of their main needs and whishes to design the specifications, test the performance expected. Obstacles to turn round and limits for risks evaluation (directs or implicit), acceptability, utility, respect of intimacy and dignity, and balance with freedom and security and frontiers to artificial intelligence are discussed As quoted in the discussion with the French and Japanese experts attending the Toulouse Robotics and medicine symposium (March 26th 2011), the need of a new ethical approach, going further the present ethical rules is needed for the design and social status of ethical robots, having capacity cas factor of progress and global quality of innovation design in an ageing society."
24558734,"Brain, mind, body and society: autonomous system in robotics",Motomu Shimoda,"In this paper I examine the issues related to the robot with mind. To create a robot with mind aims to recreate neuro function by engineering. The robot with mind is expected not only to process external information by the built-in program and behave accordingly, but also to gain the consciousness activity responding multiple conditions and flexible and interactive communication skills coping with unknown situation. That prospect is based on the development of artificial intelligence in which self-organizing and self-emergent functions have been available in recent years. To date, controllable aspects in robotics have been restricted to data making and programming of cognitive abilities, while consciousness activities and communication skills have been regarded as uncontrollable aspects due to their contingency and uncertainty. However, some researchers of robotics claim that every activity of the mind can be recreated by engineering and is therefore controllable. Based on the development of the cognitive abilities of children and the findings of neuroscience, researchers have attempted to produce the latest artificial intelligence with autonomous learning systems. I conclude that controllability is inconsistent with autonomy in the genuine sense and autonomous robots recreated by engineering cannot be autonomous partners of humans."
24533427,"Direct and Indirect Effects of Brain Volume, Socioeconomic Status and Family Stress on Child IQ",Jade V Marcus Jenkins,"11 background: A large literature documents the detrimental effects of socioeconomic disparities on intelligence and neuropsychological development. Researchers typically measure environmental factors such as socioeconomic status (SES), using income, parent's occupation and education. However, SES is more complex, and this complexity may influence neuropsychological outcomes. 12 methods: This studyused principal components analysis to reduce 14 SES and 28 family stress indicators into their core dimensions (e.g. community and educational capital, financial resources, marital conflict). Core dimensions were used in path analyses to examine their relationships with parent IQ and cerebral volume (white matter, grey matter and total brain volume), to predict child IQ in a sample of typically developing children. 13 results: Parent IQ affected child IQ directly and indirectly through community and educational capital, demonstrating how environmental factors interact with familial factors in neuro-development. There were no intervening effects of cerebral white matter, grey matter, or total brain volume. 14 conclusions: Findings may suggest that improving community resources can foster the intellectual development of children."
24528593,Developmental validation of the HIrisPlex system: DNA-based eye and hair colour prediction for forensic and anthropological usage,Susan Walsh,"Forensic DNA Phenotyping or 'DNA intelligence' tools are expected to aid police investigations and find unknown individuals by providing information on externally visible characteristics of unknown suspects, perpetrators and missing persons from biological samples. This is especially useful in cases where conventional DNA profiling or other means remain non-informative. Recently, we introduced the HIrisPlex system, capable of predicting both eye and hair colour from DNA. In the present developmental validation study, we demonstrate that the HIrisPlex assay performs in full agreement with the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM) guidelines providing an essential prerequisite for future HIrisPlex applications to forensic casework. The HIrisPlex assay produces complete profiles down to only 63 pg of DNA. Species testing revealed human specificity for a complete HIrisPlex profile, while only non-human primates showed the closest full profile at 20 out of the 24 DNA markers, in all animals tested. Rigorous testing of simulated forensic casework samples such as blood, semen, saliva stains, hairs with roots as well as extremely low quantity touch (trace) DNA samples, produced complete profiles in 88% of cases. Concordance testing performed between five independent forensic laboratories displayed consistent reproducible results on varying types of DNA samples. Due to its design, the assay caters for degraded samples, underlined here by results from artificially degraded DNA and from simulated casework samples of degraded DNA. This aspect was also demonstrated previously on DNA samples from human remains up to several hundreds of years old. With this paper, we also introduce enhanced eye and hair colour prediction models based on enlarged underlying databases of HIrisPlex genotypes and eye/hair colour phenotypes (eye colour: N = 9188 and hair colour: N = 1601). Furthermore, we present an online web-based system for individual eye and hair colour prediction from full and partial HIrisPlex DNA profiles. By demonstrating that the HIrisPlex assay is fully compatible with the SWGDAM guidelines, we provide the first forensically validated DNA test system for parallel eye and hair colour prediction now available to forensic laboratories for immediate casework application, including missing person cases. Given the robustness and sensitivity described here and in previous work, the HIrisPlex system is also suitable for analysing old and ancient DNA in anthropological and evolutionary studies."
24523788,Evidence based administration of risperidone and paliperidone for the treating conduct disorder,Ahmad Ghanizadeh,"Background: This study evaluates the evidence-based administration of risperidone and paliperidone for the treating children and adolescents with conduct disorder (CD). Materials and methods: A review of the current literature from clinical trials that investigated the efficacy of risperidone and paliperidone on CD considering the inclusion criteria and search strategies was performed by a search of PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Results: Out of 53 titles, 31 were irrelevant. The abstract of 22 potentially related articles were studied. Only six articles reported the results of clinical trial. However, one of them reported the effect of risperidone on conduct behaviors in autistic disorders. One study was a re-analysis of two previous studies, one study reported the effects of maintenance versus withdrawal of risperidone treatment and two studies included children with sub-average intelligence. Headache, somnolence and increased appetite are among the most common reported adverse effects. No study examined the effect of paliperidone on CD was found. Conclusion: Current literature suggests that risperidone could be effective for treating some conduct behaviors in children and adolescents. The effect of risperidone on CD is not a well-researched area. There is no well-controlled evidence based reports about the safety and efficacy of risperidone for the treatment of CD. Further trials should examine the efficacy of these medications on CD rather than conduct behaviors or disruptive behavior disorders."
24505723,Voxelwise spectral diffusional connectivity and its applications to Alzheimer's disease and intelligence prediction,Junning Li,"Human brain connectivity can be studied using graph theory. Many connectivity studies parcellate the brain into regions and count fibres extracted between them. The resulting network analyses require validation of the tractography, as well as region and parameter selection. Here we investigate whole brain connectivity from a different perspective. We propose a mathematical formulation based on studying the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the diffusion tensor field at the voxel level. This voxelwise matrix has over a million parameters, but we derive the Kirchhoff complexity and eigen-spectrum through elegant mathematical theorems, without heavy computation. We use these novel measures to accurately estimate the voxelwise connectivity in multiple biomedical applications such as Alzheimer's disease and intelligence prediction."
24501639,"Prokaryotic Super Program Advisory Committee DOE Joint Genome Institute, Walnut Creek, CA, March 27, 2013",George M Garrity,"The Prokaryotic Super Program Advisory Committee met on March 27, 2013 for their annual review the Prokaryotic Super Program at the DOE Joint Genome Institute. As is the case with any site visit or program review, the objective is to evaluate progress in meeting organizational objectives, provide feedback to from the user-community and to assist the JGI in formulating plans for the coming year. The advisors want to commend the JGI for its central role in developing new technologies and capabilities, and for catalyzing the formation of new collaborative user communities. Highlights of the post-meeting exchanges among the advisors focused on the importance of programmatic initiatives including: • GEBA, which serves as a phylogenetic ""base-map"" on which our knowledge of functional diversity can be layered. • FEBA, which promises to provide new insights into the physiological capabilities of prokaryotes under highly standardized conditions. • Single-cell genomics technology, which is seen to significantly enhance our ability to interpret genomic and metagenomic data and broaden the scope of the GEBA program to encompass at least a part of the microbial ""dark-matter"". • IMG, which is seen to play a central role in JGI programs and is viewed as a strategically important asset in the JGI portfolio. On this latter point, the committee encourages the formation of a strategic relationship between IMG and the Kbase to ensure that the intelligence, deep knowledge and experience captured in the former is not lost. The committee strongly urges the DOE to continue its support for maintaining this critical resource."
24494534,The relationship between sleep-activated interictal epileptiform discharges and intelligence in children,Christine M Scott,"This study investigates the relationship between interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) during sleep in children with benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) and cognitive test scores as measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) with the hypothesis that, as IEDs increase, cognitive test scores decrease. Studies have shown that generalized seizures and status epilepticus can negatively impact cognition (Dodrill 2004), that children with epilepsy have lower cognitive function on average than children without epilepsy and that children with epilepsy and abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs) have lower cognitive function than children with epilepsy and normal EEGs (Bailet et al. 2000). Studies have also indicated that as IEDs decrease, neurocognitive test scores increase (Baglietto et al. 2001). The current study evaluated sleep-activated IEDs in children with the specific syndrome of benign rolandic epilepsy based on the frequency of LEDs in sleep in relation to cognitive test scores. Neuropsychological test scores from the WISC-IV were gathered along with the number of spikes per minute detected in EEG recordings. Statistical analysis revealed a negative correlation between spike frequency and both processing speed and coding scores, though the relationship did not reach statistical significance. This study concludes that there may be correlations between increased spike density and cognitive test scores, or there might be other factors impacting cognition in BRE, but a larger sample is needed to further investigate. In addition, it is possible that a negative result in the present study represents good news, that the number of IEDs in BRE does not harm the brain by negatively impacting cognition."
24493999,Emotional intelligence as an indicator of satisfaction with life of patients with psoriasis,Małgorzata A Basińska,"Introduction: Research reports confirm the existence of a relation between emotional intelligence and various aspects of human functioning. It protects psychical and physical health of an individual, helps to adapt to new conditions and, consequently, contributes to the increase in life quality expressed in satisfaction with life. Psoriasis, a chronic skin disease, may negatively influence the psychical state of a patient and his or her social functioning, which leads to the decrease in satisfaction with life. Aim: This research aimed at determining the relation between emotional intelligence and satisfaction with life in a group of patients with psoriasis. Material and methods: The research group consisted of 81 people with psoriasis (40 men and 41 women) with the average age of 41.22 (SD = 14.18). The research tools used included the Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire INTE, Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), personal questionnaire and PASI scale. Results: There is a positive correlation between emotional intelligence and satisfaction with life in the group of patients with psoriasis. Especially factor I - using emotions in thinking and operating - positively correlates with satisfaction with life. Conclusions: Emotional intelligence together with the percentage of body area taken by pathological changes are the indicators of satisfaction with life in patients with psoriasis."
24475528,Enhance hospital performance from intellectual capital to business intelligence,Mahtab Karami,"Business intelligence (BI) refers to technologies, tools, and practices for collecting, integrating, analyzing, and presenting large volumes of information to enable better decision making. The aim of this study is to provide a general overview of BI and its impacts on improving hospital performance. In this paper, literature is reviewed on the concept, classification, and structure of intellectual capital and BI. Research on the building of BI and its impact on the performance of hospitals are briefly summarized. Some areas in healthcare which can utilize BI benefits, including radiology, are also discussed. Used properly, BI is an effective communication tool that can enable hospitals to reach strategic goals and objectives and can also help eliminate information asymmetry."
24472488,Systems integrity in health and aging - an animal model approach,Marije Oostindjer,"Human lifespan is positively correlated with childhood intelligence, as measured by psychometric (IQ) tests. The strength of this correlation is similar to the negative effect that smoking has on the life course. This result suggests that people who perform well on psychometric tests in childhood may remain healthier and live longer. The correlation, however, is debated: is it caused exclusively by social-environmental factors or could it also have a biological component? Biological traits of systems integrity that might result in correlations between brain function and lifespan have been suggested but are not well-established, and it is questioned what useful knowledge can come from understanding such mechanisms. In a recent study, we found a positive correlation between brain function and longevity in honey bees. Honey bees are highly social, but relevant social-environmental factors that contribute to cognition-survival correlations in humans are largely absent from insect colonies. Our results, therefore, suggest a biological explanation for the correlation in the bee. Here, we argue that individual differences in stress handling (coping) mechanisms, which both affect the bees' performance in tests of brain function and their survival could be a trait of systems integrity. Individual differences in coping are much studied in vertebrates, and several species provide attractive models. Here, we discuss how pigs are an interesting model for studying behavioural, physiological and molecular mechanisms that are recruited during stress and that can drive correlations between health, cognition and longevity traits. By revealing biological factors that make individuals susceptible to stress, it might be possible to alleviate health and longevity disparities in people."
24467756,Is protein folding problem really a NP-complete one? First investigations,Christophe Guyeux,"To determine the 3D conformation of proteins is a necessity to understand their functions or interactions with other molecules. It is commonly admitted that, when proteins fold from their primary linear structures to their final 3D conformations, they tend to choose the ones that minimize their free energy. To find the 3D conformation of a protein knowing its amino acid sequence, bioinformaticians use various models of different resolutions and artificial intelligence tools, as the protein folding prediction problem is a NP complete one. More precisely, to determine the backbone structure of the protein using the low resolution models (2D HP square and 3D HP cubic), by finding the conformation that minimizes free energy, is intractable exactly. Both proofs of NP-completeness and the 2D prediction consider that acceptable conformations have to satisfy a self-avoiding walk (SAW) requirement, as two different amino acids cannot occupy a same position in the lattice. It is shown in this document that the SAW requirement considered when proving NP-completeness is different from the SAW requirement used in various prediction programs, and that they are different from the real biological requirement. Indeed, the proof of NP completeness and the predictions in silico consider conformations that are not possible in practice. Consequences of this fact are investigated in this research work."
24466572,"Children with cochlear implants: cognitive skills, adaptive behaviors, social and emotional skills",Andrea De Giacomo,"Objective: The aim of this study is to examine cognitive skills, adaptive behavior, social and emotional skills in deaf children with cochlear implant (CI) compared to normal hearing children. Methods: The study included twenty children affected by profound hearing loss implanted with a CI compared to 20 healthy children matched to chronological age and gender. Results: Results of this study indicated that 55% of children with CI showed a score in the normal range of nonverbal intelligence (IQ > 84), 40% in the borderline range (71 < IQ < 84) and 5% were in mild range(50 < IQ < 70). No significant differences were found after comparison with normal hearing children.Children with CI reported more abnormalities in emotional symptoms (p = .018) and peer problems(p = .037) than children with normal hearing. Age of CI was negatively correlated with IQ (p = .002),positively correlated with emotional symptoms (p = .04) and with peer problems (p = .02). Conclusions: CI has a positive effect on the lives of deaf children, especially if it is implanted in much earlier ages."
24460364,Multi-agent systems: effective approach for cancer care information management,Niloofar Mohammadzadeh,"Physicians, in order to study the causes of cancer, detect cancer earlier, prevent or determine the effectiveness of treatment, and specify the reasons for the treatment ineffectiveness, need to access accurate, comprehensive, and timely cancer data. The cancer care environment has become more complex because of the need for coordination and communication among health care professionals with different skills in a variety of roles and the existence of large amounts of data with various formats. The goals of health care systems in such a complex environment are correct health data management, providing appropriate information needs of users to enhance the integrity and quality of health care, timely access to accurate information and reducing medical errors. These roles in new systems with use of agents efficiently perform well. Because of the potential capability of agent systems to solve complex and dynamic health problems, health care system, in order to gain full advantage of E- health, steps must be taken to make use of this technology. Multi-agent systems have effective roles in health service quality improvement especially in telemedicine, emergency situations and management of chronic diseases such as cancer. In the design and implementation of agent based systems, planning items such as information confidentiality and privacy, architecture, communication standards, ethical and legal aspects, identification opportunities and barriers should be considered. It should be noted that usage of agent systems only with a technical view is associated with many problems such as lack of user acceptance. The aim of this commentary is to survey applications, opportunities and barriers of this new artificial intelligence tool for cancer care information as an approach to improve cancer care management."
24457322,Cyber security: a critical examination of information sharing versus data sensitivity issues for organisations at risk of cyber attack,Jason Mallinder,"Cyber threats are growing and evolving at an unprecedented rate.Consequently, it is becoming vitally important that organisations share information internally and externally before, during and after incidents they encounter so that lessons can be learned, good practice identified and new cyber resilience capabilities developed. Many organisations are reluctant to share such information for fear of divulging sensitive information or because it may be vague or incomplete. This provides organisations with a complex dilemma: how to share information as openly as possibly about cyber incidents, while protecting their confidentiality and focusing on service recovery from such incidents. This paper explores the dilemma of information sharing versus sensitivity and provides a practical overview of considerations every business continuity plan should address to plan effectively for information sharing in the event of a cyber incident."
24455660,Angelina's choice,Nishu Singh Goel,"This is an opinion piece on how a celebrity's personal choice to undergo prophylactic mastectomy on discovery of an aberrant gene, when publicly promoted, carries in itself the power to influence and impact healthcare trends and decisions. When celebrities advocate causes that are universally and uniformly acceptable and indisputable as the best in the realm of healthcare and cure (e.g. no smoking), it creates well-being and awareness in society at large. But those which are personal choices made out of a repertoire of other available and effective options may, because of celebrity preference, don the mantle of a norm. They thus run the danger of being blindly replicated by others without proper awareness and knowledge of the true potential of disease, risk factors, and other existing remedial or risk-reducing measures. Society should thus be encouraged to question, debate, and understand the validity, authenticity, and reason of the choices, especially those with a medical basis. This tempering of information with intelligence and rationale and making informed choices based on facts will serve humanity as a whole."
24453490,Effectiveness and safety of Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™ training in children with migraine without aura: a preliminary study,Maria Esposito,"Background: Migraine without aura (MoA) is a painful syndrome, particularly in childhood; it is often accompanied by severe impairments, including emotional dysfunction, absenteeism from school, and poor academic performance, as well as issues relating to poor cognitive function, sleep habits, and motor coordination. Materials and methods: The study population consisted of 71 patients affected by MoA (32 females, 39 males) (mean age: 9.13±1.94 years); the control group consisted of 93 normally developing children (44 females, 49 males) (mean age: 8.97±2.03 years) recruited in the Campania school region. The entire population underwent a clinical evaluation to assess total intelligence quotient level, visual-motor integration (VMI) skills, and motor coordination performance, the later using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC). Children underwent training using the Wii-balance board and Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™ software (Nintendo Co, Ltd, Kyoto, Japan); training lasted for 12 weeks and consisted of three 30-minute sessions per week at their home. Results: The two starting populations (MoA and controls) were not significantly different for age (P=0.899) and sex (P=0.611). M-ABC and VMI performances at baseline (T0) were significantly different in dexterity, balance, and total score for M-ABC (P<0.001) and visual (P=0.003) and motor (P<0.001) tasks for VMI. After 3 months of Wii training (T1), MoA children showed a significant improvement in M-ABC global performance (P<0.001), M-ABC dexterity (P<0.001), M-ABC balance (P<0.001), and VMI motor task (P<0.001). Conclusion: Our study reported the positive effects of the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™ system as a rehabilitative device for the visuomotor and balance skills impairments among children affected by MoA, even if further research and longer follow-up are needed."
24447453,Chemical analysis of pharmaceuticals and explosives in fingermarks using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry,Kimberly Kaplan-Sandquist,"Chemical analysis of latent fingermarks, ""touch chemistry,"" has the potential of providing intelligence or forensically relevant information. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF MS) was used as an analytical platform for obtaining mass spectra and chemical images of target drugs and explosives in fingermark residues following conventional fingerprint development methods and MALDI matrix processing. There were two main purposes of this research: (1) develop effective laboratory methods for detecting drugs and explosives in fingermark residues and (2) determine the feasibility of detecting drugs and explosives after casual contact with pills, powders, and residues. Further, synthetic latent print reference pads were evaluated as mimics of natural fingermark residue to determine if the pads could be used for method development and quality control. The results suggest that artificial amino acid and sebaceous oil residue pads are not suitable to adequately simulate natural fingermark chemistry for MALDI/TOF MS analysis. However, the pads were useful for designing experiments and setting instrumental parameters. Based on the natural fingermark residue experiments, handling whole or broken pills did not transfer sufficient quantities of drugs to allow for definitive detection. Transferring drugs or explosives in the form of powders and residues was successful for preparing analytes for detection after contact with fingers and deposition of fingermark residue. One downfall to handling powders was that the analyte particles were easily spread beyond the original fingermark during development. Analyte particles were confined in the original fingermark when using transfer residues. The MALDI/TOF MS was able to detect procaine, pseudoephedrine, TNT, and RDX from contact residue under laboratory conditions with the integration of conventional fingerprint development methods and MALDI matrix. MALDI/TOF MS is a nondestructive technique which provides chemical information in both the mass spectra and chemical images."
24438777,The spatial and temporal distribution of pollen in a room: forensic implications,R M Morgan,"This paper presents two experimental studies that deal with the spatial and temporal distribution of pollen grains within a room of a domestic dwelling. The findings concur with the preliminary work of Morgan et al. [1] and provide greater detail as to the behaviour of pollen grains within indoor locations that are pertinent for forensic investigations. The spatial distribution of pollen in a room exhibits strong distance decay trends, with the majority of pollen recovered within 0.8m of its source. The pollen was found to persist in increasing quantities during the time the flowers were in the room. This study also shows that 20days after the flowers were removed, 25-32% of the original pollen was still present within the room. The influence of disturbance was investigated and whilst areas of high disturbance were found to retain less pollen than undisturbed locations, the influence of the proximity to source was a more dominant factor. These findings have significant implications for forensic investigation protocols, particularly the collection and interpretation phases of trace evidence analysis. The distribution of pollen around a room ensures that viable sources of trace pollen are available for transfer if contact is made between a location in the room and a suspect. The persistence of pollen many days after the flowers have been removed from a room indicates that many rooms in domestic dwellings will have distinctive assemblages that reflect the history of the flowers that have been displayed within that room in the past, and that these assemblages will persist and therefore be available for transfer. These preliminary findings indicate that investigation by forensic palynology in indoor domestic settings may well be an underutilised technique that has the potential to provide accurate and valuable intelligence and evidence for forensic enquiry."
24438775,The use of organic and inorganic impurities found in MDMA police seizures in a drug intelligence perspective,Marie Morelato,"Traditional forensic drug profiling involves numerous analytical techniques, and the whole process is typically costly and may be time consuming. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of prioritising techniques utilised at the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for the chemical profiling of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA). The outcome would provide the AFP with the ability to obtain more timely and valuable results that could be used in an intelligence perspective. Correlation coefficients were used to obtain a similarity degree between a population of linked samples (within seizures) and a population of unlinked samples (between different seizures) and discrimination between the two populations was ultimately achieved. The results showed that gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was well suited as a single technique to detect links between seizures and could be used in priority for operational intelligence purposes. Furthermore, the method was applied to seizures known or suspected (through their case information) to be linked to each other to assess the chemical similarity between samples. It was found that half of the seizures previously linked by the case number were also linked by the chemical profile. This procedure was also able to highlight links between cases that were previously unsuspected and retrospectively confirmed by circumstantial information. The findings are finally discussed in the broader forensic intelligence context, with a focus on how they could be successfully incorporated into investigations and in an intelligence-led policing perspective in order to understand trafficking markets."
24431472,A Survey on Ambient Intelligence in Health Care,Giovanni Acampora,"Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a new paradigm in information technology aimed at empowering people's capabilities by the means of digital environments that are sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to human needs, habits, gestures, and emotions. This futuristic vision of daily environment will enable innovative human-machine interactions characterized by pervasive, unobtrusive and anticipatory communications. Such innovative interaction paradigms make ambient intelligence technology a suitable candidate for developing various real life solutions, including in the health care domain. This survey will discuss the emergence of ambient intelligence (AmI) techniques in the health care domain, in order to provide the research community with the necessary background. We will examine the infrastructure and technology required for achieving the vision of ambient intelligence, such as smart environments and wearable medical devices. We will summarize of the state of the art artificial intelligence methodologies used for developing AmI system in the health care domain, including various learning techniques (for learning from user interaction), reasoning techniques (for reasoning about users' goals and intensions) and planning techniques (for planning activities and interactions). We will also discuss how AmI technology might support people affected by various physical or mental disabilities or chronic disease. Finally, we will point to some of the successful case studies in the area and we will look at the current and future challenges to draw upon the possible future research paths."
24424102,Sleep disorders in children with cerebral palsy: neurodevelopmental and behavioral correlates,Domenico M Romeo,"Objectives: We aimed to estimate the frequency of sleep disorders in children with cerebral palsy (CP) using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) and to evaluate the relations between sleep disorders and motor, cognitive, and behavioral problems. Methods: One hundred and sixty-five children with CP ages 6-16 years (mean age, 11years) were assessed using the SDSC, the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children and the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) to assess sleep, motor, cognitive, and behavioral problems, respectively. Results: An abnormal total sleep score was found in 19% of children with CP; more than 40% of children had an abnormal score on at least one SDSC factor. The SDSC total score was significantly associated (P<.01) with mental retardation, epilepsy, CBCL scores, and level 5 on the GMFCS. Conclusions: Our results confirm that sleep disorders are common in children with cerebral palsy. The relationship between motor and cognitive behavior and epilepsy should be further explored to better understand how these factors influence one another to identify effective treatments and to improve the well-being of the child."
24408338,The use of nouns and verbs by children with Down syndrome in two different situations,Suelly Cecilia Olivan Limongi,"Purpose: To verify the use of nouns and verbs by children with Down syndrome and to compare this use between conditions of interaction with the mother and the Speech-language pathologist (SLP). Methods: Participants were 21 children aged between 5 and 11 years, divided into three groups, according to chronological and mental age as established by the results of the Primary Tests of Nonverbal Intelligence. The speech sample was obtained through free interaction situations that were videotaped during session of 30 minutes and transcribed in specific protocols. The first 100 utterances from the first five minutes were used. The interval between each situation ranged from 7 to 15 days. T-test and analysis of variance were used for statistical analysis and the significance level adopted was of 5%. Results: More verbs than nouns were used in both conditions; however, a higher number of nouns were observed during the interaction with the SLP. The between-group comparison in the interaction with the SLP shows significant differences for verbs and nouns, but during the interaction with the mother, there was tendency for difference only for the verbs. Conclusion: The data indicate the growing development on using of nouns and verbs according to the increase of age. There was a higher use of verbs when compared with nouns mainly in the condition of interaction with the SLP."
24408238,Phonological awareness and the working memory of children with and without literacy difficulties,Andreia Martins de Souza Cardoso,"Purpose: To investigate phonological awareness and working memory skills as well as their influence on the literacy process in a group of intellectually normal children. Methods: Forty intellectually normal children (7.6-8.0 years) from the second and third grades of elementary school participated. Children were organized in two groups (20 children each): one with and another without literacy difficulties. These participants underwent RAVEN's intelligence quotient test, audiometric assessment, CONFIAS test of phonological awareness, written spelling task, and working memory test. Results: Children in the alphabetic phase presented a good development of phonological awareness, and 85% of them showed a high-performance working memory. Children in the syllabic-alphabetic phase had changes in phonological awareness, and 91.6% of them showed an average working memory performance. The subjects at pre-syllabic and syllabic phases demonstrated more difficulties in phonological awareness than those at syllabic-alphabetic and had a poor working memory performance. Between-group differences were observed for CONFIAS and working memory tests (p<0.0001). There was also a significant correlation (r=0.78, p=0.01) between the skills of phonological awareness and working memory for the total sample of individuals. Conclusions: Based on these results, it was found that as phonological awareness and working memory levels increased, the literacy phase also advanced, therefore showing that these are directly proportional measures."
24407307,EEG/ERP adaptive noise canceller design with controlled search space (CSS) approach in cuckoo and other optimization algorithms,M K Ahirwal,"This paper explores the migration of adaptive filtering with swarm intelligence/evolutionary techniques employed in the field of electroencephalogram/event-related potential noise cancellation or extraction. A new approach is proposed in the form of controlled search space to stabilize the randomness of swarm intelligence techniques especially for the EEG signal. Swarm-based algorithms such as Particles Swarm Optimization, Artificial Bee Colony, and Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm with their variants are implemented to design optimized adaptive noise canceler. The proposed controlled search space technique is tested on each of the swarm intelligence techniques and is found to be more accurate and powerful. Adaptive noise canceler with traditional algorithms such as least-mean-square, normalized least-mean-square, and recursive least-mean-square algorithms are also implemented to compare the results. ERP signals such as simulated visual evoked potential, real visual evoked potential, and real sensorimotor evoked potential are used, due to their physiological importance in various EEG studies. Average computational time and shape measures of evolutionary techniques are observed 8.21E-01 sec and 1.73E-01, respectively. Though, traditional algorithms take negligible time consumption, but are unable to offer good shape preservation of ERP, noticed as average computational time and shape measure difference, 1.41E-02 sec and 2.60E+00, respectively."
24399975,Dysconnectivity in the frontoparietal attention network in schizophrenia,Jonathan P Roiser,"Cognitive impairment is common in patients with schizophrenia, and even those with relatively preserved function perform worse than healthy volunteers (HVs) on attentional tasks. This is consistent with the hypothesis that connectivity - in the frontoparietal network (FPN) activated during attention - is disrupted in schizophrenia. We examined attentional effects on connectivity in the FPN, in schizophrenia, using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Twenty-three HVs and 19 first-episode schizophrenia patients were scanned during a simple visual change test, known to activate the FPN, in which attention was monitored and directed with an orthogonal flicker-detection task. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) of evoked responses was used to assess effective connectivity - and its modulation by changes in the attended stimulus dimension - in the following network: higher visual area; temporoparietal junction (TPJ); intraparietal sulcus (IPS); dorsal anterior cingulate cortex; and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. The final MEG analysis included 18 HVs and 14 schizophrenia patients. While all participants were able to maintain attention, HVs responded slightly, but non-significantly, more accurately than schizophrenia patients. HVs, but not schizophrenia patients, exhibited greater cortical responses to attended visual changes. Bayesian model comparison revealed that a DCM with attention dependent changes in both top-down and bottom-up connections best explained responses by patients with schizophrenia, while in HVs the best model required only bottom-up changes. Quantitative comparison of connectivity estimates revealed a significant group difference in changes in the right IPS-TPJ connection: schizophrenia patients showed relative reductions in connectivity during attended stimulus changes. Crucially, this reduction predicted lower intelligence. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that functional dysconnections in the FPN contribute to cognitive impairment in schizophrenia."
24398256,Spatial working memory ability in individuals at ultra high risk for psychosis,Vina M Goghari,"The goal of this investigation was to clarify the nature of spatial working memory difficulties in individuals at ultra high risk (UHR) for psychosis. We evaluated spatial working memory and intelligence in 96 individuals at UHR for psychosis, 28 patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), and 23 healthy controls. Fourteen UHR individuals developed a psychotic disorder during follow-up. Compared to controls, the UHR group was impaired in both the short-term maintenance of material and in the effective use of strategy, but not more immediate memory. These impairments were not as severe as those in the FEP group, as the UHR group performed better than the FEP group. A similar pattern of results was found for the intelligence measures. Discriminant function analyses demonstrated short-term maintenance of material significantly differentiated the UHR and healthy control groups even when accounting for full scale intelligence quotient (IQ); whereas full scale IQ significantly differentiated the UHR and FEP groups and FEP and control groups. Notably, within the UHR group, impaired spatial working memory performance was associated with lower global functioning, but not full scale IQ. The subgroup of UHR individuals who later developed psychosis was not significantly more impaired on any aspect of working memory performance than the group of UHR individuals who did not develop psychosis. Given, the relationship between spatial working memory deficits and functional outcome, these results indicate that cognitive remediation could be useful in individuals at UHR for psychosis to potentially improve functioning."
24396685,Polyglandular Autoimmune Syndrome Type III with Primary Hypoparathyroidism,Sang Jin Kim,"Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome is defined as multiple endocrine gland insufficiencies accompanied by autoimmune diseases of the endocrine and nonendocrine system. After Schmidt introduced a case of nontuberculosis adrenal gland dysfunction with thyroiditis in 1926, Neufeld defined polyglandular autoimmune syndrome by I, II, and III subtypes in 1980 by their presentation of occurrence age, heredity methods, relationship with human leukocyte antigen, and accompanying diseases. We report a case of a 32-year-old female with polyglandular autoimmune syndrome III accompanied by type 1 diabetes mellitus that was treated with insulin (36 units per day) for 11 years. She had insulin deficiency and Hashimoto thyroiditis as an autoimmune disorder. In addition, she had several features similar to Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy including short stature, truncal obesity, round face, short neck, low intelligence (full IQ 84), and decreased memory. Although Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy is morphological evidence of pseudohypoparathyroidism or pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, she had primary hypoparathyroidism on laboratory results. Here, we report a case of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome III with type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune thyroiditis, and primary hypoparathyroidism, accompanied by clinical features similar to Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy."
24394878,Correlation between sleep disorder screening and executive dysfunction in children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder,Elizabeth Zambrano-Sánchez,"Objective: To compare frequency of sleep disorders (SD) and executive dysfunction (ED) in children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and a control group. Method: We studied 156 children with ADHD with a mean age of 8.5 years, and a control group with 111 children with a mean age of 8.3 years. We utilized the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) to screen SD and the working memory measurement from the Wechsler intelligence scale for children (WISC-IV) to screen ED. Results: We did not observe an increased frequency of SD in children with ADHD compared with the controls. However, we did identify ED in children with ADHD; additionally a significant correlation was observed between the type of ADHD and SD and among ED, WISC-IV measurements, and type of SD in children with ADHD. Conclusion: An increase of SD frequency in children with ADHD was not observed, but we did identify ED in children with ADHD. Additionally, a correlation among ADHD types, SD, ED, and WISC-IV measurements was observed in children with ADHD."
24391781,A critical meta-analysis of lens model studies in human judgment and decision-making,Esther Kaufmann,"Achieving accurate judgment ('judgmental achievement') is of utmost importance in daily life across multiple domains. The lens model and the lens model equation provide useful frameworks for modeling components of judgmental achievement and for creating tools to help decision makers (e.g., physicians, teachers) reach better judgments (e.g., a correct diagnosis, an accurate estimation of intelligence). Previous meta-analyses of judgment and decision-making studies have attempted to evaluate overall judgmental achievement and have provided the basis for evaluating the success of bootstrapping (i.e., replacing judges by linear models that guide decision making). However, previous meta-analyses have failed to appropriately correct for a number of study design artifacts (e.g., measurement error, dichotomization), which may have potentially biased estimations (e.g., of the variability between studies) and led to erroneous interpretations (e.g., with regards to moderator variables). In the current study we therefore conduct the first psychometric meta-analysis of judgmental achievement studies that corrects for a number of study design artifacts. We identified 31 lens model studies (N = 1,151, k = 49) that met our inclusion criteria. We evaluated overall judgmental achievement as well as whether judgmental achievement depended on decision domain (e.g., medicine, education) and/or the level of expertise (expert vs. novice). We also evaluated whether using corrected estimates affected conclusions with regards to the success of bootstrapping with psychometrically-corrected models. Further, we introduce a new psychometric trim-and-fill method to estimate the effect sizes of potentially missing studies correct psychometric meta-analyses for effects of publication bias. Comparison of the results of the psychometric meta-analysis with the results of a traditional meta-analysis (which only corrected for sampling error) indicated that artifact correction leads to a) an increase in values of the lens model components, b) reduced heterogeneity between studies, and c) increases the success of bootstrapping. We argue that psychometric meta-analysis is useful for accurately evaluating human judgment and show the success of bootstrapping."
24384325,Task structure complexity and goal neglect in typically developing children,Gareth Roberts,"Goal neglect is a failure to enact task requirements despite being able to accurately report them. In this study, we introduce a new child-appropriate experimental paradigm to measure goal neglect in children between 7 and 11 years of age and test the hypothesis that the complexity of an action plan, not real-time trial demands, increases goal neglect. A total of 66 children (Mage=9.50 years) were administered a Feature Match task. Half of the children were given four rules for matching, and half were given three rules for matching. After practice, the four-rules group was told to ignore the additional rule, and both groups completed an identical three-rules task. The results showed that the extra rule increased goal neglect and its correlation with fluid intelligence. Although intermittent trial errors were correlated with fluid intelligence for both groups, only in the four-rules group were systematic rule failures (i.e., goal neglect) correlated with fluid intelligence. Task performance improved with chronological age; however, when controlling for the influence of fluid intelligence, the relationship between age and task performance was effectively removed. This suggests that a child's current level of fluid intelligence (and not age) determines task performance. We suggest that the relationship among goal neglect, complex task instructions, and fluid intelligence is linked to the mental preparation for future events, that is, mentally compiling verbal instructions into a set of activated goal representations in working memory that represent what is to be done and under what circumstances."
24382822,Genetic associations between intelligence and cortical thickness emerge at the start of puberty,Rachel M Brouwer,"Cognitive abilities are related to (changes in) brain structure during adolescence and adulthood. Previous studies suggest that associations between cortical thickness and intelligence may be different at different ages. As both intelligence and cortical thickness are heritable traits, the question arises whether the association between cortical thickness development and intelligence is due to genes influencing both traits. We study this association in a longitudinal sample of young twins. Intelligence was assessed by standard IQ tests at age 9 in 224 twins, 190 of whom also underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Three years later at age 12, 177/125 twins returned for a follow-up measurement of intelligence/MRI scanning, respectively. We investigated whether cortical thickness was associated with intelligence and if so, whether this association was driven by genes. At age 9, there were no associations between cortical thickness and intelligence. At age 12, a negative relationship emerged. This association was mainly driven by verbal intelligence, and manifested itself most prominently in the left hemisphere. Cortical thickness and intelligence were explained by the same genes. As a post hoc analysis, we tested whether a specific allele (rs6265; Val66Met in the BDNF gene) contributed to this association. Met carriers showed lower intelligence and a thicker cortex, but only the association between the BDNF genotype and cortical thickness in the left superior parietal gyrus reached significance. In conclusion, it seems that brain areas contributing to (verbal) intellectual performance are specializing under the influence of genes around the onset of puberty."
24381888,"Emotional, behavioral and cognitive profile, and quality of life of Indian children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes",Kriti Puri,"Background and aims: The psychological stress associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D) may be higher in children from developing world due to limited health resources. The aims of the study were to assess the quality of life (QoL), emotional well-being, behavioral, and cognitive profile of children/adolescents with T1D diagnosed at least 6 months prior. Materials and methods: Forty-nine children with T1D, aged 6-18 years were assessed using DAWN Youth QoL questionnaire, WHO-5 Well-Being Index, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian children (MISIC). The association of the scores was studied with age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), frequency of hypoglycemia, HbA1c, and age of onset and duration of T1D. Results: The mean (standard deviation (SD)) for DAWN QoL, WHO-5, CBCL, and MISIC scores was 24.7 (16.7), 74.6 (19.4), 52.6 (8.8), and 96.0 (11.2), respectively. The significant associations noted were: Elevated HbA1c with poorer emotional well-being; higher negative impact on 'symptoms of disease' and 'future prospects' sub-areas of QoL; shorter duration of disease with more behavioral issues; lower maternal education with more 'withdrawn/depressed' behaviors and 'worry about future prospects'; and lower SES with lower MISIC scores. Earlier onset (age <5 years) was associated with fewer behavioral problems and less negative impact on QoL. Conclusion: Children with recent diagnosis, older age at onset, lower maternal educational level, elevated HbA1c, or belonging to lower SES were identified to have higher prevalence of various psychological and cognitive problems. In resource-limited settings, these children should be prioritized for behavioral and cognitive evaluation."
24380768,A prenatal case of split-hand malformation associated with 17p13.3 triplication - a dilemma in genetic counseling,H M Luk,"Copy number gain of 17p13.3 has been shown to be associated with developmental delay/autism and Split-Hand-Foot malformation. We report a case of fetus with bilateral split-hand malformation detected on prenatal ultrasound. Array comparative genomic hybridization detected 2 maternally inherited copy number gains in the 17p13.3 region with one of them involving the BHLHA9 gene and part of the YWHAE gene. The mother is normal in intelligence with mild right foot anomaly only. Although the BHLHA9 copy gain is known to be associated with split-hand-foot malformation, the penetrance and expressivity is highly variable. More challenging is the effect of partial YWHAE copy number gain on neurodevelopment is inconclusive based on current literature. This case highlights the difficulties of prenatal genetic counseling in array comparative genomic hybridization findings in clinical situation with incomplete understanding of genotype-phenotype correlation."
24380623,Factors related to academic success among nursing students: a descriptive correlational research study,Audrey M Beauvais,"Background: The current rise in employment is improving forecasts for the future supply of registered nurses; however sizeable shortages are still projected. With the intention of improving academic success in nursing students, related factors need to be better understood. Objectives: The purpose of the correlational study was to describe the relationship between emotional intelligence, psychological empowerment, resilience, spiritual well-being, and academic success in undergraduate and graduate nursing students. Design/setting: A descriptive correlational design was utilized. The study was set in a private Catholic university. Participants: There were 124 participants. There were 59% undergraduate and 41% graduate students. Methods: Background data, in addition to the Spreitzer Psychological Empowerment Scale, the Wagnild and Young Resilience Scale, and the Spiritual Well-Being Scale and the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test, was collected from students who met study criteria. Results: In a combined sample, academic success was correlated with overall spiritual well-being, empowerment and resilience. Although academic success was not correlated with overall emotional intelligence, it was correlated with the emotional intelligence branch four (managing emotions) score. When undergraduate and graduate students were considered separately, only one correlation was found to be significantly related to academic success in the undergraduate sample, namely, emotional intelligence branch one (perceiving emotions). When examining the data from just graduate level nurses, significant relationships were found between total emotional intelligence with academic success, resilience with academic success, and psychological empowerment with academic success. Conclusion: The significant relationship between psychological empowerment, resilience, spiritual well-being and academic success in this study supports the statements in the literature that these concepts may play an important role in persistence through the challenges of nursing education. Research is needed to examine if strategies to enhance empowerment, resilience, and spiritual well-being can increase academic success in a test-retest design."
24380312,Effect of tongluo xingnao effervescent tablet on learning and memory of AD rats and expression of insulin-degrading enzyme in hippocampus],Yin-Jie Zhang,"Objective: To study the effect of Tongluo Xingnao effervescent tablet on learning and memory of dementia rats induced by injection of Abeta25-35 in hippocampus and expression of insulin-degrading enzyme in hippocampus, in order to provide basis for preventing and treating senile dementia. Method: The dementia rat model was established by injecting Abeta25-35 in hippocampus. The rats were divided into the model control group, the Aricept (1.4 mg x kg(-1)) group, and Tongluo Xingnao effervescent tablet high dose (7.56 g x kg(-1)), middle dose (3.78 g x kg(-1)) and low dose (1.59 g x kg(-1)) groups. A sham operation group was established by injecting normal saline in hippocampus. The rats were orally given drugs for 90 days, once a day. Their learning and memory were tested by using Morris water maze. Immunohistochemistry and image analysis were utilized for a quantitative analysis on the expression of insulin-degrading enzyme in hippocampus. Result: Tongluo Xingnao effervescent tablet could significantly shorten the escape latency of rats in the directional navigation test, prolong the retention time in the first quadrant dwell, decrease the retention time in the third quadrant dwell, increase the frequency of crossing the platform, show a more notable statistical significance than the model control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, it could also remarkably increase the average optical density of insulin-degrading enzyme in hippocampus, promote the expression of insulin-degrading enzyme in hippocampus, and show a more notable statistical significance than the model control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Tongluo Xingnao effervescent tablet has the effects of improving learning and memory capacity of AD rats and promoting the expression of insulin-degrading enzyme in hippocampus. Its effect in promoting intelligence will be related to increased insulin-degrading enzyme in hippocampus."
28989348,The outcome competency framework for practitioners in infection prevention and control: use of the outcome logic model for evaluation,E Burnett,"Healthcare is delivered in a dynamic environment with frequent changes in populations, methods, equipment and settings. Infection prevention and control practitioners (IPCPs) must ensure that they are competent in addressing the challenges they face and are equipped to develop infection prevention and control (IPC) services in line with a changing world of healthcare provision. A multifaceted Framework was developed to assist IPCPs to enhance competence at an individual, team and organisational level to enable quality performance and improved quality of care. However, if these aspirations are to be met, it is vital that competency frameworks are fit for purpose or they risk being ignored. The aim of this unique study was to evaluate short and medium term outcomes as set out in the Outcome Logic Model to assist with the evaluation of the impact and success of the Framework. This study found that while the Framework is being used effectively in some areas, it is not being used as much or in the ways that were anticipated. The findings will enable future work on revision, communication and dissemination, and will provide intelligence to those initiating education and training in the utilisation of the competences."
24379945,Neurocognitive function differentiation from the effect of psychopathologic symptoms in the disability evaluation of patients with mild traumatic brain injury,Jin-Sung Kim,"Objective: We determined whether the relationship between the neuropsychological performance of patients with mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their psychopathological characteristics measured by disability evaluation are interrelated. In addition, we assessed which psychopathological variable was most influential on neuropsychological performance via statistical clustering of the same characteristics of mild TBI. Methods: A total of 219 disability evaluation participants with mild brain injury were selected. All participants were classified into three groups, based on their psychopathological characteristics, via a two-step cluster analysis using validity and clinical scales from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and Symptom Checklist-90-revised (SCL-90-R). The Korean Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (K-WAIS), Korean Memory Assessment Scale (K-MAS) and the Korean Boston Naming Test (K-BNT) were used to evaluate the neurocognitive functions of mild TBI patients. Results: Over a quarter (26.9%) experienced severe psychopathological symptoms and 43.4% experienced mild or moderate psychopathological symptoms, and all of the mild TBI patients showed a significant relationship between neurocognitive functions and subjective and/or objective psychopathic symptoms, but the degree of this relationship was moderate. Variances of neurocognitive function were explained by neurotic and psychotic symptoms, but the role of these factors were different to each other and participants did not show intelligence and other cognitive domain decrement except for global memory abilities compared to the non-psychopathology group. Conclusion: Certain patients with mild TBI showed psychopathological symptoms, but these were not directly related to cognitive decrement. Psychopathology and cognitive decrement are discrete aspects in patients with mild TBI. Furthermore, the neurotic symptoms of mild TBI patients made positive complements to decrements or impairments of neurocognitive functions, but the psychotic symptoms had a negative effect on neurocognitive functions."
24379031,Psychiatric approaches for disorders of sex development: experience of a multidisciplinary team,Burcu Özbaran,"Objective: Disorders of sex development (DSD) are a group of congenital medical conditions that affect life as a whole. In this study, we aimed to reflect the experience of a multidisciplinary team in the clinical/psychiatric follow-up of a group of children and adolescents with DSD. Methods: The study group consisted of 51 patients diagnosed with DSD. The Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised, Draw a Person Test and Children's Apperception Test, and the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS) were used for psychiatric evaluations. Results: The mean age of the patients was 7.8 years (median: 7.8; min: 1.0; max: 18.0). Genetic evaluation showed 46,XX configuration in 15 patients (29.4%) and 46,XY in 35 (68.6%). One patient (2.0%) was diagnosed to have a sex chromosome disorder. Forty patients (78.4%) had no problems with their given gender identity and gender role. Thirty-four (66.7%) patients had normal intellectual capacity. Twenty-eight (54.9%) patients did not have any psychiatric problem. Depression, anxiety disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and adjustment disorders were the common diagnoses. The mean score of symptom severity on CGIS-severity-baseline was 6.15±0.68 and after one year, it was 1.46±0.51 (Z=-3.236 p=0.001). The mean score of CGI-Improvement was 1.23±0.44. Conclusion: It is important to identify and treat the psychiatric disorders encountered in patients with DSD. A psychiatrist needs to be included in the professional team following these patients. Examination and observation results need to be shared by holding periodic team meetings to establish a wholesome point of view for every unique child."
24378088,Right hemisphere role in cognitive reserve,Ian H Robertson,"High levels of education, occupational complexity, and/or premorbid intelligence are associated with lower levels of cognitive impairment than would be expected from a given brain pathology. This has been observed across a range of conditions including Alzheimer's disease (Roe et al., 2010), stroke (Ojala-Oksala et al., 2012), traumatic brain injury (Kesler et al., 2003), and penetrating brain injury (Grafman, 1986). This cluster of factors, which seemingly protect the brain from expressing symptoms of damage, has been termed ""cognitive reserve"" (Stern, 2012). The current review considers one possible neural network, which may contribute to cognitive reserve. Based on the evidence that the neurotransmitter, noradrenaline mediates cognitive reserve's protective effects (Robertson, 2013) this review identifies the neurocognitive correlates of noradrenergic (NA) activity. These involve a set of inter-related cognitive processes (arousal, sustained attention, response to novelty, and awareness) with a strongly right hemisphere, fronto-parietal localization, along with working memory, which is also strongly modulated by NA. It is proposed that this set of processes is one plausible candidate for partially mediating the protective effects of cognitive reserve. In addition to its biological effects on brain structure and function, NA function may also facilitate networks for arousal, novelty, attention, awareness, and working memory, which collectively provide for a set of additional, cognitive, mechanisms that help the brain adapt to age-related changes and disease. It is hypothesized that to the extent that the lateral surface of the right prefrontal lobe and/or the right inferior parietal lobe maintain structural (white and gray matter) and functional integrity and connectivity, cognitive reserve should benefit and behavioral expression of pathologic damage should thus be mitigated."
24377440,A positive correlation between serum levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor and negative symptoms in schizophrenia,Tomihisa Niitsu,"A meta-analysis study reported serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels as a potential biomarker for schizophrenia. However, at the time, commercially available human ELISA kits were unable to distinguish between pro-BDNF (precursor BDNF) and mature BDNF, because of limited antibody specificity. Here, we used new ELISA kits, to examine serum levels of mature BDNF and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which converts pro-BDNF to mature BDNF in schizophrenia. Sixty-three patients with chronic schizophrenia and 52 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Patients were evaluated using the Brief Psychiatry Rating Scale, the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and neuropsychological tests. Neither serum mature BDNF nor MMP-9 levels differed between patients and controls. In male subgroups, serum MMP-9 levels of smoking patients were higher than those of non-smoking patients, but this was not observed in male controls or the female subgroup. In patients, serum mature BDNF levels were associated with SANS total scores and the Information subtest scores of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (WAIS-R), while serum MMP-9 levels were associated with smoking and category fluency scores. These findings suggest that neither mature BDNF nor MMP-9 is a suitable biomarker for schizophrenia, although further studies using large samples are needed."
24377176,Cognitive enhancement in Canadian medical students,Paul A Kudlow,"Background: Cognitive enhancing agents are substances that may augment functions such as memory, attention, concentration, wakefulness, and intelligence. Methods: An anonymous, online survey containing a series of questions on the actual and hypothetical use of cognitive enhancers was sent via email to 647 medical students across all four years in one Canadian MD program. Results: The response rate was 50% (326/647). Overall, 49 (15%, 95% CI: 11% to 19%) students admitted to non-medical and/or off-label use of one or more pharmaceutical stimulants, of whom 14 (4%, 95% CI: 2% to 6%) had used stimulants within the last year. Senior medical students reported recent use more often than junior students (8% vs. 2%, P = 0.04). Class seniority and male gender were both associated with positive attitudes towards use of these agents; favorable attitudes were associated with recent use of pharmaceutical stimulant and high-caffeine products. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of Canadian medical students have engaged at some point in non-medical and/or off-label use of stimulants for purposes of cognitive enhancement. Male students and those in upper years of the MD program were more likely to have used pharmaceutical stimulants in the last year, and have favorable attitudes concerning use of cognitive-enhancing agents."
24376697,Decision making under uncertainty: a quasimetric approach,Steve N'Guyen,"We propose a new approach for solving a class of discrete decision making problems under uncertainty with positive cost. This issue concerns multiple and diverse fields such as engineering, economics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science and many others. Basically, an agent has to choose a single or series of actions from a set of options, without knowing for sure their consequences. Schematically, two main approaches have been followed: either the agent learns which option is the correct one to choose in a given situation by trial and error, or the agent already has some knowledge on the possible consequences of his decisions; this knowledge being generally expressed as a conditional probability distribution. In the latter case, several optimal or suboptimal methods have been proposed to exploit this uncertain knowledge in various contexts. In this work, we propose following a different approach, based on the geometric intuition of distance. More precisely, we define a goal independent quasimetric structure on the state space, taking into account both cost function and transition probability. We then compare precision and computation time with classical approaches."
24376662,Aberrant interference of auditory negative words on attention in patients with schizophrenia,Norichika Iwashiro,"Previous research suggests that deficits in attention-emotion interaction are implicated in schizophrenia symptoms. Although disruption in auditory processing is crucial in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, deficits in interaction between emotional processing of auditorily presented language stimuli and auditory attention have not yet been clarified. To address this issue, the current study used a dichotic listening task to examine 22 patients with schizophrenia and 24 age-, sex-, parental socioeconomic background-, handedness-, dexterous ear-, and intelligence quotient-matched healthy controls. The participants completed a word recognition task on the attended side in which a word with emotionally valenced content (negative/positive/neutral) was presented to one ear and a different neutral word was presented to the other ear. Participants selectively attended to either ear. In the control subjects, presentation of negative but not positive word stimuli provoked a significantly prolonged reaction time compared with presentation of neutral word stimuli. This interference effect for negative words existed whether or not subjects directed attention to the negative words. This interference effect was significantly smaller in the patients with schizophrenia than in the healthy controls. Furthermore, the smaller interference effect was significantly correlated with severe positive symptoms and delusional behavior in the patients with schizophrenia. The present findings suggest that aberrant interaction between semantic processing of negative emotional content and auditory attention plays a role in production of positive symptoms in schizophrenia.

24375832,The early cognitive development of children at high risk of developing an eating disorder,Radha Kothari,"Diagnosis of an eating disorder (ED) has been associated with differences in cognition. Recent evidence suggests that differences may be present prior to onset. Children at familial high risk for ED show cognitive differences at ages 8-10 years. Research is required to investigate differences in cognitive development at various time points. This is the first study to investigate cognitive development in children at high risk at 18 months (Griffiths Mental Development Scale; n=982) and 4 years old (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Revised; n=582), in comparison with children not at risk, using a general population sample, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Children of women with lifetime anorexia nervosa revealed difficulties in social understanding, visual-motor function, planning and abstract reasoning. Cognitive differences observed here have also been observed in clinical groups. This suggests difficulties may be present prior to onset, potentially affecting risk status for development of ED. Findings contribute to an understanding of aetiology, and design of prevention/intervention strategies."
24374020,Independent effects of bilingualism and socioeconomic status on language ability and executive functioning,Alejandra Calvo,"One hundred and seventy-five children who were 6-years old were assigned to one of four groups that differed in socioeconomic status (SES; working class or middle class) and language background (monolingual or bilingual). The children completed tests of nonverbal intelligence, language tests assessing receptive vocabulary and attention based on picture naming, and two tests of executive functioning. All children performed equivalently on the basic intelligence tests, but performance on the language and executive functioning tasks was influenced by both SES and bilingualism. Middle-class children outperformed working-class children on all measures, and bilingual children obtained lower scores than monolingual children on language tests but higher scores than monolingual children on the executive functioning tasks. There were no interactions with either group factors or task factors. Thus, each of SES and bilingualism contribute significantly and independently to children's development irrespective of the child's level on the other factor."
24373930,Cognitive impairment among children at-risk for schizophrenia,Hannah Dickson,"Adults with schizophrenia present cognitive impairments, as do individuals at ultra-high risk for the disorder, youth with relatives with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and children with antecedents of schizophrenia. The present study aimed to determine if impairments in childhood differed depending on the definition of risk and/or on the degree of relatedness to an affected individual, and if impairments were explained by IQ. Four groups of children aged 9-12 years were studied: (1) 13 children with ≥1 first-degree or ≥2 second-degree affected relatives (high familial loading: FHx(H)); (2) 14 with ≥1 affected second-degree relative (lower familial loading: FHx(L)); (3) 32 with well-replicated antecedents of schizophrenia (ASz); and (4) 45 typically-developing (TD) children with neither a positive family history nor antecedents. Compared to TD children, both FHx(H) and ASz children exhibited significantly poorer verbal comprehension, scholastic achievement, and verbal working memory, while FHx(H) children additionally displayed significantly lower full-scale IQ, and verbal memory and executive function impairments. After adjusting statistical analyses for IQ, group differences were attenuated. Relative to TD children, FHx(L) children showed no significant differences in performance. The results imply that impairments in verbal comprehension, scholastic achievement, and verbal working memory may index vulnerability for schizophrenia among children with affected relatives with the disorder and among those with multiple antecedents of the disorder who have no affected relatives. More accurate identification of children at-risk for schizophrenia and the specific deficits that they present provides opportunities for interventions such as cognitive remediation that may impact the development of the illness."
24371326,Differential neurodevelopmental trajectories in patients with early-onset bipolar and schizophrenia disorders,Celso Arango,"Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders share not only clinical features but also some risk factors such as genetic markers and childhood adversity, while other risk factors such as urbanicity and obstetric complications seem to be specific to schizophrenia. An intriguing question is whether the well-established abnormal neurodevelopment present in many children and adolescents who eventually develop schizophrenia is also present in bipolar patients. The literature on adult bipolar patients is controversial. We report data on a subgroup of patients with pediatric-onset psychotic bipolar disorder who seem to share some developmental trajectories with patients with early-onset schizophrenia. These early-onset psychotic bipolar patients have low intelligence quotient, more neurological signs, reduced frontal gray matter at the time of their first psychotic episode, and greater brain changes than healthy controls in a pattern similar to early-onset schizophrenia cases. However, patients with early-onset schizophrenia seem to have more social impairment, developmental abnormalities (eg, language problems), and lower academic achievement in childhood than early-onset bipolar patients. We suggest that some of these abnormal developmental trajectories are more related to the phenotypic features (eg, early-onset psychotic symptoms) of these 2 syndromes than to categorically defined Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders disorders."
24370466,Auditory processing disorders: relationship to cognitive processes and underlying auditory neural integrity,Prudence Allen,"Background: Auditory processing disorder (APD) in children has been reported and discussed in the clinical and research literature for many years yet there remains poor agreement on diagnostic criteria, the relationship between APD and cognitive skills, and the importance of assessing underlying neural integrity. Purpose: The present study used a repeated measures design to examine the relationship between a clinical APD diagnosis achieved with behavioral tests used in many clinics, cognitive abilities measured with standardized tests of intelligence, academic achievement, language, phonology, memory and attention and measures of auditory neural integrity as measured with acoustic reflex thresholds and auditory brainstem responses. Method: Participants were 63 children, 7-17 years of age, who reported listening difficulties in spite of normal hearing thresholds. Parents/guardians completed surveys about the child's auditory and attention behavior while children completed an audiologic examination that included 5 behavioral tests of auditory processing ability. Standardized tests that examined intelligence, academic achievement, language, phonology, memory and attention, and objective tests auditory function included crossed and uncrossed acoustic reflex thresholds and auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were also administered to each child. Results: Forty of the children received an APD diagnosis based on the 5 behavioral tests and 23 did not. The groups of children performed similarly on intelligence measures but the children with an APD diagnosis tended to perform more poorly on other cognitive measures. Auditory brainstem responses and acoustic reflex thresholds were often abnormal in both groups of children. Summary: Results of this study suggest that a purely behavioral test battery may be insufficient to accurately identify all children with auditory processing disorders. Physiologic test measures, including acoustic reflex and auditory brainstem response tests, are important indicators of auditory function and may be the only indication of a problem. The results also suggest that performance on behavioral APD tests may be strongly influenced by the child's language levels."
24370334,Dysfunctional inhibitory control and impulsivity in Internet addiction,Jung-Seok Choi,"The purpose of this study was to explore a psychological profile of Internet addiction (IA) considering impulsivity as a key personality trait and as a key component of neuropsychological functioning. Twenty three subjects with IA (Young's Internet Addiction Test scores=70 or more) and 24 sex-, age-, and intelligence-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Participants filled out a questionnaire about trait impulsivity, the Trait Characteristic Inventory, depression, and anxiety. Next, we administered traditional neuropsychological tests including the Stroop et al. and computerized neuropsychological tests using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. The IA group exhibited more trait impulsivity than the healthy control group. They also scored higher for novelty seeking and harm avoidance. The IA group performed more poorly than the healthy control group in a computerized stop signal test, a test for inhibitory function and impulsivity; no group differences appeared for other neuropsychological tests. The IA group also scored higher for depression and anxiety, and lower for self-directedness and cooperativeness. In conclusion, individuals with IA exhibited impulsivity as a core personality trait and in their neuropsychological functioning."

The main clinical features of this condition include microsomia, poor sexual development, menoschesis, gigantorectum, absence of internal genitalia, sometimes with thyropenia and low intelligence. This disease can be easily diagnosed for its heterogeneous clinical manifestations."
24369035,Comparing the accuracy of syndrome surveillance systems in detecting influenza-like illness: GUARDIAN vs. RODS vs. electronic medical record reports,Julio C Silva,"Background: A highly sensitive real-time syndrome surveillance system is critical to detect, monitor, and control infectious disease outbreaks, such as influenza. Direct comparisons of diagnostic accuracy of various surveillance systems are scarce. Objective: To statistically compare sensitivity and specificity of multiple proprietary and open source syndrome surveillance systems to detect influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing data from 1122 patients seen during November 1–7, 2009 in the emergency department of a single urban academic medical center. The study compared the Geographic Utilization of Artificial Intelligence in Real-time for Disease Identification and Alert Notification (GUARDIAN) system to the Complaint Coder (CoCo) of the Real-time Outbreak Detection System (RODS), the Symptom Coder (SyCo) of RODS, and to a standardized report generated via a proprietary electronic medical record (EMR) system. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each classifier's ability to identify ILI cases were calculated and compared to a manual review by a board-certified emergency physician. Chi-square and McNemar's tests were used to evaluate the statistical difference between the various surveillance systems.ResultsThe performance of GUARDIAN in detecting ILI in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, as compared to a physician chart review, was 95.5%, 97.6%, and 97.1%, respectively. The EMR-generated reports were the next best system at identifying disease activity with a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 36.7%, 99.3%, and 83.2%, respectively. RODS (CoCo and SyCo) had similar sensitivity (35.3%) but slightly different specificity (CoCo = 98.9%; SyCo = 99.3%). The GUARDIAN surveillance system with its multiple data sources performed significantly better compared to CoCo (χ2 = 130.6, p < 0.05), SyCo (χ2 = 125.2, p < 0.05), and EMR-based reports (χ2 = 121.3, p < 0.05). In addition, similar significant improvements in the accuracy (>12%) and sensitivity (>47%) were observed for GUARDIAN with only chief complaint data as compared to RODS (CoCo and SyCo) and EMR-based reports. Conclusion: In our study population, the GUARDIAN surveillance system, with its ability to utilize multiple data sources from patient encounters and real-time automaticity, demonstrated a more robust performance when compared to standard EMR-based reports and the RODS systems in detecting ILI. More large-scale studies are needed to validate the study findings, and to compare the performance of GUARDIAN in detecting other infectious diseases."
24368742,A consecutive study on arsenic exposure and intelligence quotient (IQ) of children in Bangladesh,Mst Nasrin Nahar,"Objective: In a recent cross-sectional investigation, we reported the intellectual function of adolescents (aged 14 and 15 years) in Bangladesh who had been exposed to arsenic (As). Here, we report a consecutive investigation on the intelligence quotient (IQ) of 408 children who are living in the Sonargoan Thana of Bangladesh (two age groups: 9 and 10 years; 4 and 5 years) were exposed to high levels of As in the groundwater. Methods: Urine and water samples were collected to assess As exposure. The IQ of the children was estimated using the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test. Information on parents' socioeconomic status (SES) was collected as confounding factors. Results: The results indicate that As exposure was responsible for a lower IQ. The concentration of urinary As ([As]u) was associated with reduced intellectual function in a dose-response manner. A stronger association was found between reduced intellectual function (IQ) and [As]u than the level of As in the drinking water [As]w. There was no association between verbal IQ scores and [As]u of children in early childhood (aged 4 and 5 years). Conclusion: Based on these results, we conclude that current levels of As in the urine ([As]u), which we considered to reflect recent exposure to As from all possible sources, including groundwater, food, among others, were negatively associated to the IQ of the children tested, and that this adverse effect of As may also gradually accumulate over time among the poor."
24368261,Left fronto-parietal white matter correlates with individual differences in children's ability to solve additions and multiplications: a tractography study,Leen Van Beek,"Functional neuroimaging data have pointed to the activation of a fronto-parietal network during calculation tasks, the activity of which is modulated by arithmetic operation and arithmetical competence. As the cortical brain regions of this network are distant, it is crucial to investigate the white matter connections between them and to examine how these connections are related to different arithmetic operations and individual differences in arithmetical competence. By using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography in eighteen 12-year-olds, we tested whether white matter pathways connecting these distant regions were related to children's arithmetical competence and how this association was modulated by operation. For each child, we delineated the three subcomponents of the arcuate fasciculus, a bundle of pathways linking frontal and temporo-parietal regions that are commonly active during calculation tasks. Fractional anisotropy in the left anterior portion of the arcuate fasciculus was positively correlated with addition and multiplication, but not with subtraction and division, suggesting a specific role of this left anterior segment in the solution of those problems that are expected to be solved with fact retrieval. The observed correlation was not explained by age, intelligence and working memory. Follow-up control analyses using different types of reading measures revealed that the observed correlation only disappeared when measures that draw heavily on phonological processing, such as non-word reading, were controlled for, suggesting that the association between the left arcuate fasciculus-anterior and addition/multiplication reflects the involvement of phonological processing. These results are the first to demonstrate that individual differences in fronto-parietal white matter are associated with arithmetical competence in typically developing children of a very narrow age range and indicate that this association is modulated by arithmetic operation."
24199263,Nationwide Response Issues After an Improvised Nuclear Device Attack: Medical and Public Health Considerations for Neighboring Jurisdictions: Workshop Summary,Forum on Medical and Public Health Preparedness for Catastrophic Events,"Our nation faces the distinct possibility of a catastrophic terrorist attack using an improvised nuclear device (IND), according to international and U.S. intelligence. Detonation of an IND in a major U.S. city would result in tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of victims and would overwhelm public health, emergency response, and health care systems, not to mention creating unprecedented social and economic challenges. While preparing for an IND may seem futile at first glance, thousands of lives can be saved by informed planning and decision making prior to and following an attack. In 2009, the Institute of Medicine published the proceedings of a workshop assessing the health and medical preparedness for responding to an IND detonation. Since that time, multiple federal and other publications have added layers of detail to this conceptual framework, resulting in a significant body of literature and guidance. However, there has been only limited planning effort at the local level as much of the federal guidance has not been translated into action for states, cities and counties. According to an informal survey of community preparedness by the National Association of City and County Health Officials (NACCHO), planning for a radiation incident ranked lowest in priority among other hazards by 2,800 local health departments. The focus of Nationwide Response Issues After an Improvised Nuclear Device Attack: Medical and Public Health Considerations for Neighboring Jurisdictions: Workshop Summary is on key response requirements faced by public health and health care systems in response to an IND detonation, especially those planning needs of outlying state and local jurisdictions from the detonation site. The specific meeting objectives were as follows: - Understand the differences between types of radiation incidents and implications of an IND attack on outlying communities. -Highlight current planning efforts at the federal, state, and local level as well as challenges to the implementation of operational plans. -Examine gaps in planning efforts and possible challenges and solutions. -Identify considerations for public health reception centers: how public health and health care interface with functions and staffing and how radiological assessments and triage be handled. -Discuss the possibilities and benefits of integration of disaster transport systems. -Explore roles of regional health care coalitions in coordination of health care response."
24365456,"Psychosis prevalence and physical, metabolic and cognitive co-morbidity: data from the second Australian national survey of psychosis",V A Morgan,"Background: There are insufficient data from nationwide surveys on the prevalence of specific psychotic disorders and associated co-morbidities. Method: The 2010 Australian national psychosis survey used a two-phase design to draw a representative sample of adults aged 18-64 years with psychotic disorders in contact with public treatment services from an estimated resident population of 1 464 923 adults. This paper is based on data from 1642 participants with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 psychotic disorder. Its aim is to present estimates of treated prevalence and lifetime morbid risk of psychosis, and to describe the cognitive, physical health and substance use profiles of participants. Results: The 1-month treated prevalence of psychotic disorders was 3.10 cases per 1000 population aged 18-64 years, not accounting for people solely accessing primary care services; lifetime morbid risk was 3.45 per 1000. Mean premorbid intelligence quotient was approximately 0.5 s.d.s below the population mean; current cognitive ability (measured with a digit symbol coding task) was 1.6 s.d.s below the population mean. For both cognitive tests, higher scores were significantly associated with better independent functioning. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was high, affecting 60.8% of participants, and pervasive across diagnostic groups. Of the participants, two-thirds (65.9%) were current smokers, 47.4% were obese and 32.4% were sedentary. Of the participants, half (49.8%) had a lifetime history of alcohol abuse/dependence and 50.8% lifetime cannabis abuse/dependence. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive, integrative models of recovery to maximize the potential for good health and quality of life for people with psychotic illness."
24365404,Subjects at Ultra High Risk for psychosis have 'heterogeneous' intellectual functioning profile: a multiple-case study,Emilie Magaud,"In Ultra High Risk (UHR) studies, intellectual functioning is commonly assessed using premorbid IQ tools as a covariate. The aim of this study was to show that the use of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) could yield accurate neuropsychological profiling and that an alternative approach such as a multiple-case study could be a more interesting way to isolate discrete cognitive processes in the early stage of illness. The studied population consisted of 198 adolescents and young adults (16-30 y.o.) referred to our outpatient clinic. After the CAARMS' interview, we defined 3 subgroups: UHR (N=104), First Episode (FE; N=30), and Help-Seekers (HS; N=64) who were neither UHR nor psychotic. Intellectual functioning was assessed by the WAIS-III (9 subtests version) and 'heterogeneous' intellectual profiles were defined based on the existence of a 3-point difference in scoring at subtests constitutive of the same WAIS index. While UHR did not differ from FE or HS on WAIS' scores and sub-scores, the multiple-case study indicated a higher proportion of 'heterogeneous' profiles in the Verbal Comprehension Index in the UHR sample than in FE and HS (p=0.04). The disease progression could heterogeneously impact on specific domains, in patterns depending on the stage of the illness. This approach exploring intra-subject WAIS performances might be more relevant than the use of global scores in detecting the subtle cognitive alteration of emerging psychosis."
24364457,"Motor skills, cognitive development and balance functions of children with Down syndrome",Roksana Malak,"Introduction and objectives: Motor and cognitive development of children with Down syndrome (DS) is delayed and inharmonic. Neuro-muscular abnormalities, such as hypotonia, retained primary reflexes, and slow performance of volitional reaction, result in difficulties with body balance. The aim of the presented study is to assess the global motor functions and body balance of children with DS in relation to age and mental development. Material and methods: The study group consisted of 79 children with DS (42 boys, 37 girls), average age 6 years and 3 months ± 4 years and 6 months. Participants were divided according to age range into 3 groups: < 3 years old, 3-6 years old, > 6 years old. Children were assessed using Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) and Paediatric Balance Scale (PBS). Psychological diagnosis served to determine the degree of mental development using the Brunet-Lezine Scale for children younger than 3 years old, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) for those who are older than 3 years. Nine children in research group had not been diagnosed by psychologists, which is the reason why the analysis referring to mental development was performed in 70 children (34 girls, 36 boys), with an average age of 4 years and 6 months. Results: GMFM-88 scores were significantly lower in children with moderate psychomotor delay than in children with mild psychomotor delay, or normally developed children, p=0.043. GMFM-88 scores in children with profound mental impairment were lower than in children with mild or moderate mental impairment. There was a statistical significant correlation between GMFM-88 scores and the PBS scores, r= 0.7, p<0.0001. Conclusions: Motor development of children with Down syndrome from towns and villages in the Greater Poland region is associated with cognitive development, especially in the first three years of life, with the balance functions being closely related to motor skills."
24364401,Adolescent self-organization predicts midlife memory in a prospective birth cohort study,Man K Xu,"Childhood and adolescent mental health have a lasting impact on adult life chances, with strong implications for subsequent health, including cognitive aging. Using the British 1946 birth cohort, the authors tested associations between adolescent conduct problems, emotional problems and aspects of self-organization, and verbal memory at 43 years and rate of decline in verbal memory from 43 to 60-64 years. After controlling for childhood intelligence, adolescent self-organization was positively associated with verbal memory at 43 years, mainly through educational attainment, although not with rate of memory decline. Associations between adolescent conduct and emotional problems and future memory were of negligible magnitude. It has been suggested that interventions to improve self-organization may save a wide range of societal costs; this study also suggests that this might also benefit cognitive function in later life."
24364233,Pseudoachondroplasia: a case report,Vladimir Radlović,"Introduction: Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) is an autosomal dominant osteochondrodysplasia due to mutations in the gene encoding cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. It is characterized by rhizomelic dwarfism, limb and vertebral deformity, joint laxity and early onset osteoarthrosis. We present the girl with the early expressed and severe PSACH born to clinically and radiographically unaffected parents. Case outline: A 6.5-year-old girl presented with short-limbed dwarfism (body height 79.5 cm, < P5;-32%) and normal craniofacial appearance and intelligence. The girl was normal until 3 months of age when she expressed growth retardation with apparently shorter extremities in relation to the torso. With age, her rhizomelic dwarfism became increasingly visible, and since completed 15 months of age, when she started to walk, the disease was complicated with genu varum, lumbar lordosis and abnormal gait. Beside visibly short forearms, short, broad and ulnar deviation of the hands, brachydactyly and joint hyperlaxity, the radiographic picture showed markedly flared metaphyses, small and irregular epiphyses and poorly formed acetabulum. Conclusion: PSACH is an achondroplasia-like rhizomelic dwarfism recognized by the absence of abnormality at birth, normal craniofacial appearance, characteristic epiphyseal and metaphyseal radiographic finding and joint hyperlaxity."
24361815,Comparison of two nonverbal intelligence tests among children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing,Jannel Phillips,"The primary goal of the current study is to evaluate the concurrent validity of the Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised (Leiter-R Brief IQ) and Differential Ability Scales - Second Edition (DAS-II Nonverbal Reasoning Index) in a group of children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Knowing the breadth of cognitive tools appropriate for use in children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing is highly beneficial, given that clinical and school psychologists are often challenged to reliably assess cognitive functions in the context of hearing loss. Participants included 54 children between three and six years of age with permanent bilateral hearing loss. As part of the study, neurocognitive assessments were conducted by a pediatric neuropsychologist or licensed clinical psychologist with extensive experience administering assessments to children with developmental disabilities, including children with hearing loss. The Leiter-R Brief IQ score was similar to the DAS-II nonverbal reasoning index, with no significant difference in the mean scores across the two assessments. The severity of hearing loss was not correlated to either the Leiter-R or the DAS-II nonverbal IQ. Nearly a quarter of the children evaluated had meaningful intra-individual differences between scores on the Leiter-R and DAS-II that were more than one standard deviation from one another. Conducting accurate intellectual assessments in children who are deaf and hard-of-hearing is fundamental in determining and designing interventions and educational services. More comprehensive neuropsychological test batteries utilizing several tasks to assess a single domain (such as nonverbal reasoning) may be warranted for children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing."
24361380,Genetic modulation of working memory deficits by ankyrin 3 gene in schizophrenia,Chen Zhang,"Neuropsychological endophenotype approach is an emerging strategy in schizophrenia research to understand and identify the functional importance of genetically transmitted, brain-based deficits present in this disorder. Accumulating evidence indicated that working memory deficit is a core neuropsychological dysfunction in schizophrenia and a primary endophenotype indexing the liability to develop schizophrenia. Genetic variation in ankyrin 3 gene (ANK3) is likely to have widespread cognitive effects. Our previous study has identified a significant association of ANK3 SNPs and schizophrenia. In this study, we aimed to examine whether the schizophrenia-risk SNPs within ANK3 may affect working memory deficits in schizophrenia patients. Herein, we assess the working memory performance in 163 patients with first-episode, antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenia and 42 sex, age-matched healthy subjects using N-back task. Two SNPs rs10761482 and rs10994336 were genotyped among the patients and 209 controls. Our results showed that schizophrenia patients showed significantly poorer performance than healthy controls on N-back task (ps<0.01). After adjusting for the scores of intelligence quotient, memory quotient and the demographic factors, there was a significant genotype effect of the rs10994336 on the accuracy rate and reaction time of 2-back item (p=0.048 and 0.024, respectively). Post-hoc analyses showed that patients with rs10994336T/T genotype had significantly lower accuracy rate and more reaction time at 2-back task than those with T/C and C/C genotypes. The association of SNP rs10994336 with schizophrenia was replicated in our sample (genotypic p=0.024 and allelic p=0.006). However, we did not find any significant association of rs10761482 with schizophrenia and parameters in N-back task. Our results indicated that genetic variation within ANK3 may exert gene-specific modulating effects on working memory deficits in schizophrenia."
24359975,Safety intelligence: an exploration of senior managers' characteristics,L S Fruhen,"Senior managers can have a strong influence on organisational safety. But little is known about which of their personal attributes support their impact on safety. In this paper, we introduce the concept of 'safety intelligence' as related to senior managers' ability to develop and enact safety policies and explore possible characteristics related to it in two studies. Study 1 (N = 76) involved direct reports to chief executive officers (CEOs) of European air traffic management (ATM) organisations, who completed a short questionnaire asking about characteristics and behaviours that are ideal for a CEO's influence on safety. Study 2 involved senior ATM managers (N = 9) in various positions in interviews concerning their day-to-day work on safety. Both studies indicated six attributes of senior managers as relevant for their safety intelligence, particularly, social competence and safety knowledge, followed by motivation, problem-solving, personality and interpersonal leadership skills. These results have recently been applied in guidance for safety management practices in a White Paper published by EUROCONTROL."
24358581,How healthcare leaders can increase emotional intelligence,Jason Scott,"How leaders deal with a variety of feelings will deduce how successful they are in dealing with the daily challenges of being in a leadership position. Successful healthcare leaders are those who lead with heart and possess the soft skills needed to positively influence others. All humans have two minds: the rational one and the emotional one, which operate in tight harmony to assist in decision making. When passions surge, the emotional mind takes over and sometimes makes a decision before the rational mind has time to react. Some strategies to help leaders strengthen emotional intelligence include keeping an emotional journal, daily meditation, positive visualization, appreciative inquiry, thought before action, and empathetic listening. Four skills that will enhance an individual's emotional intelligence include self awareness, self management, social management, and relationship management."
24358358,Pathway evidence of how musical perception predicts word-level reading ability in children with reading difficulties,Hugo Cogo-Moreira,"Objective: To investigate whether specific domains of musical perception (temporal and melodic domains) predict the word-level reading skills of eight- to ten-year-old children (n = 235) with reading difficulties, normal quotient of intelligence, and no previous exposure to music education classes. Method: A general-specific solution of the Montreal Battery of Evaluation of Amusia (MBEA), which underlies a musical perception construct and is constituted by three latent factors (the general, temporal, and the melodic domain), was regressed on word-level reading skills (rate of correct isolated words/non-words read per minute). Results: General and melodic latent domains predicted word-level reading skills."
24357617,Self-affirmation among the poor: cognitive and behavioral implications,Crystal C Hall,"The poor are universally stigmatized. The stigma of poverty includes being perceived as incompetent and feeling shunned and disrespected. It can lead to cognitive distancing, diminish cognitive performance, and cause the poor to forego beneficial programs. In the present research, we examined how self-affirmation can mitigate the stigma of poverty through randomized field experiments involving low-income individuals at an inner-city soup kitchen. Because of low literacy levels, we used an oral rather than written affirmation procedure, in which participants verbally described a personal experience that made them feel successful or proud. Compared with nonaffirmed participants, affirmed individuals exhibited better executive control, higher fluid intelligence, and a greater willingness to avail themselves of benefits programs. The effects were not driven by elevated positive mood, and the same intervention did not affect the performance of wealthy participants. The findings suggest that self-affirmation can improve the cognitive performance and decisions of the poor, and it may have important policy implications."
24353613,Educating tomorrow's doctors: A cross sectional survey of emotional intelligence and empathy in medical students of Lahore,Nazish Imran,"Objective: Medical education in Pakistan traditionally emphasizes physician's biomedical knowledge with less emphasis on interpersonal skills and ability to relate to the patients. This study explored the emotional intelligence & empathy of undergraduate medical students and investigated its relationship with various factors to act as baseline for future work in this area. Methodology: The Schutte Emotional Intelligence scale and Davis' Interpersonal Reactivity Index in addition to socio demographic questionnaire were administered to first year and final year medical undergraduates of two medical Institutions in Lahore, Pakistan. Data was analyzed by using SPSS 17 version. Results: The overall mean scores for medical students both on emotional intelligence and empathy is significantly lower than that found in previous literature, highlighting that medical students do not appear to fare better than average people in EQ. Women showed statistically significant higher scores on Appraisal of emotions , Regulation of emotions, Empathic concern Scale & Personal distress scale. Comparison of EI & IRI of students according to medical college year did not show any statistical significance. Conclusion: Current medical curriculum and training in Pakistan does not appear to increase EI abilities which are building blocks that may allow students and residents to develop competence. Medical educators in Pakistan should look for ways to incorporate emotional intelligence in medical curriculum which will ultimately contribute towards patient centered practice, patient satisfaction as well as effective communication skills."
24351962,Neuropsychological abnormalities in children with the Panayiotopoulos syndrome point to parietal lobe dysfunction,Ricardo Lopes,"Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS) is a common epilepsy syndrome associated with rare clinical seizures and unknown localization of the epileptogenic area. Despite findings of normal development in patients with PS, recent neuropsychological studies point to subtle and diverse cognitive impairments. No well-outlined hypothesis about the localization of the brain dysfunction responsible for these impairments has been proposed. We further explored the cognitive dysfunctions in PS and made inferences on the most likely anatomical localization of brain impairment. A group of 19 patients (aged 6-12) with PS was rated according to spike activity and lateralization. The patients were submitted to a neuropsychological evaluation to assess general intelligence, memory, language, visual-perceptual abilities, attention, and executive functions. Using 35-channel scalp EEG recordings, the N170 face-evoked event-related potential (ERP) was obtained to assess the functional integrity of the ventral pathway. All patients with PS showed normal IQ but subtle and consistent neurocognitive impairments. Namely, we found abnormalities in the copy task of the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure and in the Narrative Memory Test. There was no correlation between neuropsychological impairments with spike activity and hemispheric spike lateralization. The N170 ERP was normal in all patients except for one. Our neuropsychological findings demonstrate impairments in visual-perceptual abilities and in semantic processing. These findings, paired with the absence of occipital lobe dysfunction in all neuropsychological studies of PS performed to this date, support the existence of parietal lobe dysfunction."
24349174,Psychosocial functioning and intelligence both partly explain socioeconomic inequalities in premature death. A population-based male cohort study,Daniel Falkstedt,"Objective: The possible contributions of psychosocial functioning and intelligence differences to socioeconomic status (SES)-related inequalities in premature death were investigated. None of the previous studies focusing on inequalities in mortality has included measures of both psychosocial functioning and intelligence. Methods: The study was based on a cohort of 49 321 men born 1949-1951 from the general community in Sweden. Data on psychosocial functioning and intelligence from military conscription at ∼18 years of age were linked with register data on education, occupational class, and income at 35-39 years of age. Psychosocial functioning was rated by psychologists as a summary measure of differences in level of activity, power of initiative, independence, and emotional stability. Intelligence was measured through a multidimensional test. Causes of death between 40 and 57 years of age were followed in registers. Results: The estimated inequalities in all-cause mortality by education and occupational class were attenuated with 32% (95% confidence interval: 20-45%) and 41% (29-52%) after adjustments for individual psychological differences; both psychosocial functioning and intelligence contributed to account for the inequalities. The inequalities in cardiovascular and injury mortality were attenuated by as much as 51% (24-76%) and 52% (35-68%) after the same adjustments, and the inequalities in alcohol-related mortality were attenuated by up to 33% (8-59%). Less of the inequalities were accounted for when those were measured by level of income, with which intelligence had a weaker correlation. The small SES-related inequalities in cancer mortality were not attenuated by adjustment for intelligence. Conclusions: Differences in psychosocial functioning and intelligence might both contribute to the explanation of observed SES-related inequalities in premature death, but the magnitude of their contributions likely varies with measure of socioeconomic status and cause of death. Both psychosocial functioning and intelligence should be considered in future studies."
24349040,Complex variation in measures of general intelligence and cognitive change,Suzanne J Rowe,"Combining information from multiple SNPs may capture a greater amount of genetic variation than from the sum of individual SNP effects and help identifying missing heritability. Regions may capture variation from multiple common variants of small effect, multiple rare variants or a combination of both. We describe regional heritability mapping of human cognition. Measures of crystallised (gc) and fluid intelligence (gf) in late adulthood (64-79 years) were available for 1806 individuals genotyped for 549,692 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The same individuals were tested at age 11, enabling us the rare opportunity to measure cognitive change across most of their lifespan. 547,750 SNPs ranked by position are divided into 10, 908 overlapping regions of 101 SNPs to estimate the genetic variance each region explains, an approach that resembles classical linkage methods. We also estimate the genetic variation explained by individual autosomes and by SNPs within genes. Empirical significance thresholds are estimated separately for each trait from whole genome scans of 500 permutated data sets. The 5% significance threshold for the likelihood ratio test of a single region ranged from 17-17.5 for the three traits. This is the equivalent to nominal significance under the expectation of a chi-squared distribution (between 1 df and 0) of P<1.44×10(-5). These thresholds indicate that the distribution of the likelihood ratio test from this type of variance component analysis should be estimated empirically. Furthermore, we show that estimates of variation explained by these regions can be grossly overestimated. After applying permutation thresholds, a region for gf on chromosome 5 spanning the PRRC1 gene is significant at a genome-wide 10% empirical threshold. Analysis of gene methylation on the temporal cortex provides support for the association of PRRC1 and fluid intelligence (P = 0.004), and provides a prime candidate gene for high throughput sequencing of these uniquely informative cohorts."

Although the patient presented left-sided hemiparesis for a week, no abnormal signals were indicated on diffusion-weighted imaging with repeated magnetic resonance scans. Carotid ultrasound and cerebral angiography were conducted, and they revealed hypoplasty of the left internal carotid artery with a low-lying carotid bifurcation at the level of the C6 vertebra. In addition, he was diagnosed with intellectual disabilities, evaluated by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III, and congenital velopharyngeal insufficiency. We herein present the first report of a patient with cardio-cerebrovascular abnormalities, intellectual disabilities, and an otorhinolaryngological abnormality."
24347947,Intelligence quotient is associated with epilepsy in children with intellectual disability in India,Ram Lakhan,"Background: Epilepsy is a disorder that is commonly found in people with intellectual disability (ID). The prevalence of epilepsy increases with the severity of ID. The objective of this study was to determine if there is an association between intelligence quotient (IQ) and epilepsy in children with ID. Materials and methods: A total of 262 children, aged 3-18 years, with ID were identified as part of a community-based rehabilitation project. These children were examined for epilepsy and diagnosed by a psychiatrist and physicians based on results of electroencephalogram tests. A Spearman's correlation (ρ) was used to determine if there was an association between IQ scores and the occurrence of epilepsy. X(2) statistics used to examine the relationship of epilepsy with gender, socioeconomic status, population type, severity of ID, family history of mental illness, mental retardation, epilepsy, and coexisting disorder. Results: Spearman's rho -0.605 demonstrates inverse association of IQ with epilepsy. X(2) demonstrates statistically significant association (P < 0.05) with gender, severity of ID, cerebral palsy, behavior problems, and family history of mental illness, mental retardation, and epilepsy. Conclusions: Lower IQ score in children with ID has association with occurrence of epilepsy. Epilepsy is also found highly associated with male gender and lower age."
24347255,High aspartate aminotransferase level predicts poor neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with meconium aspiration syndrome,I-Lun Chen,"Objective: The aim of our study is to clarify the perinatal predictive factors of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) with neurodevelopmental delay (ND) in infants. Materials and methods: In this retrospective study, data were collected from the infants born between 1990 and 2008. They all had primary diagnosis of MAS. Multivariable analyzed perinatal predictive factors of MAS with ND. The developmental status of these infants was followed at least 2 years with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Results: A total of 114 surviving babies met the criteria of MAS. Six babies were defined as ND group. Lower 5-minute Apgar score and diastolic blood pressure were significantly related to the ND group. Elevated asparatate aminotransferase (AST), nucleated red blood cells, and white blood cells at the time of admission were significantly high in ND group. Furthermore, AST had area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.879, (95% confidence interval: 0.801, 0.934), p < 0.0001. At 96 mg/dL, it had 83.33% sensitivity, 80.81% specificity, and negative predictive value of 98.8. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed AST was the only significant predictive factor for MAS with ND. Conclusion: Early intervention should be recommended in infants having MAS with high AST level at birth for improving their neurodevelopmental outcomes."
24346576,Fatality and hospitalization in hemodialysis patients in a health plan],Sérgio Adriano Loureiro Bersan,"Objective: To analyze clinical outcomes of patients on hemodialysis linked to health care plan provider. Methods: Cohort study of hemodialysis events in Belo Horizonte, MG, Southeastern Brazil, between 2004 and 2008, based on records from health care plan provider databases. The independent variables were: sex, age, time between first appointment with nephrologist and starting hemodialysis, type of first vascular access, diabetes mellitus, length of time spent in hospital/year of treatment and death. Dependent variables: time between starting hemodialysis and death and length of time spent in hospital/year of treatment > 7.5 days. Statistical analysis was carried out using Pearson's Chi-squared test in the univariate analysis for the outcomes 'death' and 'length of time spent in hospital/year of treatment'; the Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze survival; the Cox model and Poisson regression were used for risk of death and chance of length of time spent in hospital/year of treatment > 7.5 days. The Business Intelligence tool and Stata(r) 10.0 software were used to extract data. Results: There were 311 patients on hemodialysis included in the study, with a mean age of 62 (sd 16.6 years), of whom 55.5% were male. Prevalence increased 160% during the period in question. Survival analysis showed a higher mortality among older patients, patients that did not consult a nephrologists, those whose first vascular access was using a temporary catheter, those with diabetes mellitus, those admitted to hospital within a month of beginning hemodialysis. The Cox model showed that a higher risk of death was associated with age, diabetes mellitus, not consulting a nephrologists and those that were hospitalized within a month of beginning hemodialysis. Greater length of time spent in hospital/year of treatment was not associated with sex or diabetes. According to Poisson regression, the variables were not significant. Conclusions: Assessment by a specialist before starting hemodialysis decreases the risk of death in cases of chronic kidney disease, whereas the presence of diabetes and being hospitalized within a month of beginning hemodialysis are markers of risk of death."
24344962,A short note on extractive foraging behavior in gray snub-nosed monkeys,Zuofu Xiang,"Extractive foraging (EF) involves the exploitation of hidden or embedded foods, generally any food that is not visible to the naked eye. Therefore, EF is particularly important for survival in marginal habitats as it provides seasonal fallback foods in low food availability seasons. Although many studies consider primates' EF behavior and category, colobine species are usually categorized as non-extractive foragers and few studies quantitatively examine their EF behavior. In this study, we examined the EF behavior of one colobine species, the gray snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus brelichi), at Yangaoping in Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve, Guizhou. We recorded 6 categories of EF behaviors. The most frequently sought-out foods were seeds, young bamboo and invertebrates. Extracted foods accounted for an average of 26.02% of feeding records. As the monkey engages in little EF behavior in the winter when the food availability is low, these results seem to do not support the hypothesis that EF serves to secure additional resources during lean times in marginal or seasonal habitats. According to these findings, we suggest R. brelich should be considered as an extractive forager. Our study also highlights the need for increased representation of colobines in the EF literature to better inform the discussion concerning its link to primate brain evolution."
24344817,Atypical signed language development: a case study of challenges with visual-spatial processing,David Quinto-Pozos,"In signed languages, the articulatory space in front of the signer is used grammatically, topographically, and to depict a real or imagined space around a signer and thus is an important consideration in signed language acquisition. It has been suggested that children who acquire signed languages rely on concomitant visual-spatial development to support their linguistic development. We consider the case of a native-signing deaf adolescent female with average intelligence who had been reported to struggle with spatial aspects of American Sign Language (ASL) as a child. Results of a battery of linguistic and nonlinguistic tests suggest that she has relatively good ASL skills with the exception of some specific difficulties on spatial tasks that require attention to ASL and nonlinguistic topographic space or changes in visual perspective (e.g., classifiers and referential shift). This child has some difficulties with visual-spatial abilities, and we suggest that this has affected her acquisition of those aspects of ASL that are heavily dependent on visual-spatial processing."
24344103,Antenatal and postnatal growth and 5-year cognitive outcome in very preterm infants,Marika Leppänen,"Objectives: To study how antenatal growth affects cognitive outcome in very preterm infants and to determine whether there is an association between growth in any particular time period between birth and 5 years of age and cognitive outcome. Small for gestational age (SGA) and non-SGA infants were analyzed separately, because antenatal growth may affect postnatal growth. Methods: Very low birth weight (<1501 g) infants born between 2001 and 2006 and infants born at <32 gestational weeks between 2004 and 2006 who were treated at Turku University Hospital (n = 181) were followed. Weight, length, and head circumference (HC) of the infants were measured at 9 time points between birth and 5 years. The growth was determined as a z score change between measurement points. Cognitive development was assessed at 5 years of age with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence-Revised. The association between growth and full-scale IQ (FSIQ) was studied. Results: Growth in length and height was not associated with 5-year cognitive outcome. However, weight (r = 0.18, P = .04) and HC growth (r = 0.25, P = .01) between birth and 2 years of corrected age correlated to FSIQ in non-SGA children. In SGA children, HC growth (r = 0.33, P = .03) around term age correlated to FSIQ. Conclusions: Cognitive outcome was similar in SGA and non-SGA very preterm infants. Growth affected cognition positively in both subgroups, but the critical time period was different."
24343940,"Bold, smart, dangerous and evil: perceived correlates of core psychopathic traits among jury panel members",John F Edens,"Relatively few studies have investigated how laypersons perceive psychopathy, what factors they believe to be commonly associated with this disorder, or what rater personality characteristics might predict perceived psychopathic traits of the target person. An ethnically diverse sample of 285 US community members attending jury duty reviewed a case vignette regarding a capital murder trial and then rated (1) their perceptions of the defendant's psychopathic characteristics loosely based on trait indicators from the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised; (2) other characteristics of the defendant that might be associated with psychopathy (e.g. intelligence, violence potential); and (3) their own personality, using a very brief measure of Five Factor traits. Multivariate regression analyses indicated that participant ratings of psychopathy pertaining to the defendant were strongly associated with ratings on measures of his perceived boldness (i.e. social dominance and fearlessness), intelligence, violence potential, and perceptions that he was 'evil'. Big Five personality characteristics of the layperson raters, however, were only modestly associated with their ratings of psychopathy for the defendant. We review these results in terms of the potential stigmatization of individuals labelled as 'psychopaths' in forensic settings."
24342773,"Bullying in elementary school and psychotic experiences at 18 years: a longitudinal, population-based cohort study",D Wolke,"Background: Victims of bullying are at risk for psychotic experiences in early adolescence. It is unclear if this elevated risk extends into late adolescence. The aim of this study was to test whether bullying perpetration and victimization in elementary school predict psychotic experiences in late adolescence. Method: The current study is based on the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a prospective community-based study. A total of 4720 subjects with bullying perpetration and victimization were repeatedly assessed between the ages of 8 and 11 years by child and mother reports. Suspected or definite psychotic experiences were assessed with the Psychosis-Like Symptoms semi-structured interview at age 18 years. Results: Controlling for child's gender, intelligence quotient at age 8 years, childhood behavioural and emotional problems, and also depression symptoms and psychotic experiences in early adolescence, victims [child report at 10 years: odds ratio (OR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-3.4; mother report: OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.3], bully/victims (child report at 10 years: OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.7-5.8; mother: OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.7-5.0) and bullies (child report at 10 years: OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.3-17.7; mother: OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.46-3.1, n.s.) had a higher prevalence of psychotic experiences at age 18 years. Path analysis revealed that the association between peer victimization in childhood and psychotic experiences at age 18 years was only partially mediated by psychotic or depression symptoms in early adolescence. Conclusions: Involvement in bullying, whether as victim, bully/victim or bully, may increase the risk of developing psychotic experiences in adolescence. Health professionals should ask routinely during consultations with children about their bullying of and by peers."
24341857,Cognitive profile in patients with a first-ever lacunar infarct with and without silent lacunes: a comparative study,Lorena Blanco-Rojas,"Background: The detection of early neuropsychological abnormalities as precursors of cognitive decline of vascular origin in patients with lacunar stroke is a subject of increasing interest. The objective of this study was to assess whether there were differences in the performance of a battery of neuropsychological tests in first-ever lacunar stroke patients with and without associated silent multiple lacunar infarctions found incidentally on the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Methods: A total of 72 consecutive patients with first-ever lacunar infarction were studied 1 month after stroke. All patients underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, which included the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), Phonetic Verbal Fluency Test (PMR), Semantic Verbal Fluency Test (category ""animals""), Digit Span Forward and Backward from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results: A total of 38 patients (52.7%) had silent multiple lacunar infarcts, with corona radiata as the most frequent topography (P < 0.023). White matter hyperintensities (leukoaraiosis) were observed in 81.1% of patients with silent multiple lacunar infarcts and in 50% with a single lacunar infarction (P < 0.007). Patients in both groups showed similar scores in the MMSE, but those with associated silent lacunar infarctions showed a poorer performance in the semantic fluency test (P < 0.008) and in short delayed verbal memory (P < 0.001). In both cases, however, leukoaraiosis was not statistically significant in multivariate linear regression models adjusted by confounding covariates. In these models, multiple silent lacunar infarctions and education were independent predictors of poor performance in the semantic fluency test and in short delayed verbal memory. Conclusions: The presence of silent multiple lacunar infarctions documented on brain MRI scans in patients with first-ever lacunar stroke was associated with mild neuropsychological abnormalities, particularly in the performance of executive functions (semantic fluency) and short delayed verbal memory. According to these findings, in the initial stages of small vessel disease, mild neuropsychological abnormalities appear to be related to lacunes rather than to leukoaraiosis or perivascular hyperintensities of vascular cause."
24341786,Emotional intelligence is a second-stratum factor of intelligence: evidence from hierarchical and bifactor models,Carolyn MacCann,"This article examines the status of emotional intelligence (EI) within the structure of human cognitive abilities. To evaluate whether EI is a 2nd-stratum factor of intelligence, data were fit to a series of structural models involving 3 indicators each for fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, quantitative reasoning, visual processing, and broad retrieval ability, as well as 2 indicators each for emotion perception, emotion understanding, and emotion management. Unidimensional, multidimensional, hierarchical, and bifactor solutions were estimated in a sample of 688 college and community college students. Results suggest adequate fit for 2 models: (a) an oblique 8-factor model (with 5 traditional cognitive ability factors and 3 EI factors) and (b) a hierarchical solution (with cognitive g at the highest level and EI representing a 2nd-stratum factor that loads onto g at λ = .80). The acceptable relative fit of the hierarchical model confirms the notion that EI is a group factor of cognitive ability, marking the expression of intelligence in the emotion domain. The discussion proposes a possible expansion of Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory to include EI as a 2nd-stratum factor of similar standing to factors such as fluid intelligence and visual processing."
24341741,"Individual differences in working memory, secondary memory, and fluid intelligence: evidence from the levels-of-processing span task",Nathan S Rose,"Individual differences in working memory (WM) are related to performance on secondary memory (SM), and fluid intelligence (gF) tests. However, the source of the relation remains unclear, in part because few studies have controlled for the nature of encoding; therefore, it is unclear whether individual variation is due to encoding, maintenance, or retrieval processes. In the current study, participants performed a WM task (the levels-of-processing span task; Rose, Myerson, Roediger III, & Hale, 2010) and a SM test that tested for both targets and the distracting processing words from the initial WM task. Deeper levels of processing at encoding did not benefit WM, but did benefit subsequent SM, although the amount of benefit was smaller for those with lower WM spans. This result suggests that, despite encoding cues that facilitate retrieval from SM, low spans may have engaged in shallower, maintenance-focused processing to maintain the words in WM. Low spans also recalled fewer targets, more distractors, and more extralist intrusions than high spans, although this was partially due to low spans' poorer recall of targets, which resulted in a greater number of opportunities to commit recall errors. Delayed recall of intrusions and commission of source errors (labeling targets as processing words and vice versa) were significant negative predictors of gF. These results suggest that the ability to use source information to recall relevant information and withhold recall of irrelevant information is a critical source of both individual variation in WM and the relation between WM, SM, and gF.

24340804,"Regional intelligence and suicide rate in Germany, revisited",Martin Voracek,"Across the 10 westerly and 6 easterly states of Germany, better-than-average school-end grades, taken as a proxy for intelligence, corresponded to higher regional suicide rates. This finding adds to similar evidence from other countries (Austria, Belarus, British Isles, Denmark, Netherlands, and USA), suggestive of positive ecologic (group-level) associations between indicators for cognitive ability and suicide prevalence, whilst offsetting prior inconclusive evidence for Germany from Voracek (2006) on the same question."
24339339,Gut permeability in autism spectrum disorders,Neil Dalton,"Objective: To test whether gut permeability is increased in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) by evaluating gut permeability in a population-derived cohort of children with ASD compared with age- and intelligence quotient-matched controls without ASD but with special educational needs (SEN). Patients and methods: One hundred thirty-three children aged 10-14 years, 103 with ASD and 30 with SEN, were given an oral test dose of mannitol and lactulose and urine collected for 6 hr. Gut permeability was assessed by measuring the urine lactulose/mannitol (L/M) recovery ratio by electrospray mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry. The ASD group was subcategorized for comparison into those without (n = 83) and with (n = 20) regression. Results: There was no significant difference in L/M recovery ratio (mean (95% confidence interval)) between the groups with ASD: 0.015 (0.013-0.018), and SEN: 0.014 (0.009-0.019), nor in lactulose, mannitol, or creatinine recovery. No significant differences were observed in any parameter for the regressed versus non-regressed ASD groups. Results were consistent with previously published normal ranges. Eleven children (9/103 = 8.7% ASD and 2/30 = 6.7% SEN) had L/M recovery ratio > 0.03 (the accepted normal range cut-off), of whom two (one ASD and one SEN) had more definitely pathological L/M recovery ratios > 0.04. Conclusion: There is no statistically significant group difference in small intestine permeability in a population cohort-derived group of children with ASD compared with a control group with SEN. Of the two children (one ASD and one SEN) with an L/M recovery ratio of > 0.04, one had undiagnosed asymptomatic celiac disease (ASD) and the other (SEN) past extensive surgery for gastroschisis."
24339055,"IQ and obesity in adolescence: a population-based, cross-sectional study",S Goldberg,"What is already known about this subject: Low IQ is associated with high BMI in childhood. There are inconsistent findings on the association between low SES and high BMI. Youth with low IQ have been reported to have poorer health behaviors, such as poor nutrition and less physical activity. What this study adds: Low IQ is significantly associated with obesity for both male and female adolescents, though more strongly for female adolescents. Physical activity has a mediating effect on the association between low IQ and obesity among both male and female adolescents, though more strongly for male adolescents. The association between low IQ and obesity is strongest among adolescents from high SES backgrounds. Background: Previous studies have shown an association between low intelligence quotient (IQ), high body mass index and low socioeconomic status (SES). Objectives: This study examined the cross-sectional association between IQ and obesity, exploring the roles of gender, SES and physical activity in this association. Methods: Subjects were 235,663 male and 169,259 female adolescents assessed by the Israeli military draft board. Results: Low IQ was significantly associated with increased odds of obesity among male (odds ratio [OR] = 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36-1.52) and female adolescents (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.51-1.73); this association was significantly stronger among female adolescents. Sobel tests indicated that physical activity had a significant mediating effect on this association for male and female adolescents, although more strongly for male adolescents. Dividing the sample according to SES, the association between low IQ and obesity was strongest in the high SES group (male adolescents: OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.10-1.43, female adolescents: OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.38-1.89), even when controlling for physical activity. Conclusions: The findings suggest that low IQ is associated with increased odds of obesity, particularly in female adolescents and in adolescents with high SES. Physical activity has a mediating effect on this association, although more strongly for male than for female adolescents. Public health measures on decreasing obesity might focus on these groups."
24337449,"Paediatric European Risperidone Studies (PERS): context, rationale, objectives, strategy, and challenges",Jeffrey Glennon,"In children and adolescents with conduct disorder (CD), pharmacotherapy is considered when non-pharmacological interventions do not improve symptoms and functional impairment. Risperidone, a second-generation antipsychotic is increasingly prescribed off-label in this indication, but its efficacy and tolerability is poorly studied in CD, especially in young people with normal intelligence. The Paediatric European Risperidone Studies (PERS) include a series of trials to assess short-term efficacy, tolerability and maintenance effects of risperidone in children and adolescents with CD and normal intelligence as well as long-term tolerability in a 2-year pharmacovigilance. In addition to its core studies, secondary PERS analyses will examine moderators of drug effects. As PERS is a large-scale academic project involving a collaborative network of expert centres from different countries, it is expected that results will lead to strengthen the evidence base for the use of risperidone in CD and improve standards of care. Challenging issues faced by the PERS consortium are described to facilitate future developments in paediatric neuropsychopharmacology."
24334113,"Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) from genesis to senescence: the influence of LCPUFA on neural development, aging, and neurodegeneration",Carola I F Janssen,"Many clinical and animal studies demonstrate the importance of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) in neural development and neurodegeneration. This review will focus on involvement of LCPUFA from genesis to senescence. The LCPUFA docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid are important components of neuronal membranes, while eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and arachidonic acid also affect cardiovascular health and inflammation. In neural development, LCPUFA deficiency can lead to severe disorders like schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Perinatal LCPUFA supplementation demonstrated beneficial effects in neural development in humans and rodents resulting in improved cognition and sensorimotor integration. In normal aging, the effect of LCPUFA on prevention of cognitive impairment will be discussed. LCPUFA are important for neuronal membrane integrity and function, and also contribute in prevention of brain hypoperfusion. Cerebral perfusion can be compromised as result of obesity, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus type 2. Last, we will focus on the role of LCPUFA in most common neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. These disorders are characterized by impaired cognition and connectivity and both clinical and animal supplementation studies have shown the potential of LCPUFA to decrease neurodegeneration and inflammation. This review shows that LCPUFA are essential throughout life."
24333926,White matter connectivity and aerobic fitness in male adolescents,Megan M Herting,"Exercise has been shown to have positive effects on the brain and behavior throughout various stages of the lifespan. However, little is known about the impact of exercise on neurodevelopment during the adolescent years, particularly with regard to white matter microstructure, as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Both tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and tractography-based along-tract statistics were utilized to examine the relationship between white matter microstructure and aerobic exercise in adolescent males, ages 15-18. Furthermore, we examined the data by both (1) grouping individuals based on aerobic fitness self-reports (high fit (HF) vs. low fit (LF)), and (2) using VO2 peak as a continuous variable across the entire sample. Results showed that HF youth had an overall higher number of streamline counts compared to LF peers, which was driven by group differences in corticospinal tract (CST) and anterior corpus callosum (Fminor). In addition, VO2 peak was negatively related to FA in the left CST. Together, these results suggest that aerobic fitness relates to white matter connectivity and microstructure in tracts carrying frontal and motor fibers during adolescence. Furthermore, the current study highlights the importance of considering the environmental factor of aerobic exercise when examining adolescent brain development."
24331886,Service provision for autism in mainland China: preliminary mapping of service pathways,Xiang Sun,"Few data on healthcare services for individuals with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are available from mainland China. This article is based on findings from 69 semi-structured interviews with parents of children with ASC in three intervention centres. The respondents are from 19 regions in mainland China. A service-mapping questionnaire containing 50 questions is developed and used as an interview schedule for service mapping. The pathway to diagnosis and intervention for children with ASC is presented according to parents' experience. The findings report considerable delay along the pathway which may be partly due to the under-developed service system. Several cultural issues are identified which may also contribute to the delay, such as the perception of mental illness, folk beliefs equating delayed development of language skills in early childhood with future high intelligence, and the state-imposed one-child policy. Delays in recognising ASC and a lack of support are also considered to be associated with the considerable financial burden placed on parents of children with ASC in mainland China."
24331306,Brief report: Associations between adolescent girls' social-emotional intelligence and violence perpetration,Amy L Gower,"This study examined associations between social-emotional intelligence (SEI) and two measures of violence perpetration (relational aggression and physical violence) in a cross-sectional sample of high-risk adolescent girls (N = 253). We evaluated three aspects of SEI: stress management, intrapersonal, and interpersonal skills. Results of a multiple linear regression model accounting for participants' age, race/ethnicity, and experiences of relational aggression victimization indicated that girls with better stress management skills were less likely to perpetrate relational aggression. A parallel model for perpetration of physical violence showed a similar pattern of results. Study findings suggest that SEI, and stress management skills in particular, may protect adolescent girls - including those who have been victims of violence - from perpetrating relational aggression and physical violence. Interventions that build adolescent girls' social and emotional skills may be an effective strategy for reducing their perpetration of violence."
24331303,Feasibility and validity of ecological momentary assessment in adolescents with high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder,Angela S Khor,"Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) may increase accuracy of data compared with retrospective questionnaires by assessing behaviours as they occur, hence decreasing recall biases and increasing ecological validity. This study examined the feasibility and concurrent validity of an EMA tool for adolescents with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders (HFASD). Thirty-one adolescents with HFASD completed a mobile phone EMA application that assessed stressors and coping for two weeks. Parents and adolescents also completed retrospective measures of the adolescent's coping/stressors. Moderate compliance with the EMA tool was achieved and some concurrent validity was established with the retrospective measure of coping. Concordance was found between the types of stressors reported by parents and adolescents but not the quantity. The results suggest adolescents with HFASD are capable of reporting on their stressors and coping via EMA. EMA has the potential to be a valuable research tool in this population."
24330620,Metabarcoding avian diets at airports: implications for birdstrike hazard management planning,Megan L Coghlan,"Background: Wildlife collisions with aircraft cost the airline industry billions of dollars per annum and represent a public safety risk. Clearly, adapting aerodrome habitats to become less attractive to hazardous wildlife will reduce the incidence of collisions. Formulating effective habitat management strategies relies on accurate species identification of high-risk species. This can be successfully achieved for all strikes either through morphology and/or DNA-based identifications. Beyond species identification, dietary analysis of birdstrike gut contents can provide valuable intelligence for airport hazard management practices in regards to what food is attracting which species to aerodromes. Here, we present birdstrike identification and dietary data from Perth Airport, Western Australia, an aerodrome that saw approximately 140,000 aircraft movements in 2012. Next-generation high throughput DNA sequencing was employed to investigate 77 carcasses from 16 bird species collected over a 12-month period. Five DNA markers, which broadly characterize vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, were used to target three animal mitochondrial genes (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and COI) and a plastid gene (trnL) from DNA extracted from birdstrike carcass gastrointestinal tracts. Results: Over 151,000 DNA sequences were generated, filtered and analyzed by a fusion-tag amplicon sequencing approach. Across the 77 carcasses, the most commonly identified vertebrate was Mus musculus (house mouse). Acrididae (grasshoppers) was the most common invertebrate family identified, and Poaceae (grasses) the most commonly identified plant family. The DNA-based dietary data has the potential to provide some key insights into feeding ecologies within and around the aerodrome. Conclusions: The data generated here, together with the methodological approach, will greatly assist in the development of hazard management plans and, in combination with existing observational studies, provide an improved way to monitor the effectiveness of mitigation strategies (for example, netting of water, grass type, insecticides and so on) at aerodromes. It is hoped that with the insights provided by dietary data, airports will be able to allocate financial resources to the areas that will achieve the best outcomes for birdstrike reduction."
24330132,Alterations in white matter microstructures and cognitive dysfunctions in benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes,S E Kim,"Background and purpose: Although benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is known to have good prognosis, patients often manifest neuropsychological impairments. This study aimed to investigate cognitive dysfunctions and their relationship with white matter microstructural changes in BECTS patients. Methods: Nineteen BECTS and 25 normal subjects aged 7-16 years were included. Neuropsychological performances were assessed by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III, executive function tests, verbal and visuospatial memory tests, the verbal fluency and Boston naming tests. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed to measure the fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD), radial (RD), and mean diffusivities (MD). The voxel-wise tract-based spatial statistics and region of interest methods were used for DTI, and their correlations with cognitive variables were analyzed. Results: Patients with BECTS had lower intelligence quotient (IQ) scores compared with those of the control group. Higher AD and MD values were found in the left superior longitudinal fasciculus, the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule, posterior thalamic radiation, sagittal stratum and the body of the corpus callosum in BECTS patients compared with controls. Lower performances in verbal IQ, freedom from distractibility and processing speed were correlated with higher AD in the left superior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and lower verbal IQ scores were correlated with decreased FA values in the splenium of the corpus callosum in these patients. Conclusions: White matter microstructural changes predominantly in the left hemisphere might contribute to their cognitive abnormalities especially verbal IQ in BECTS patients."
24326300,Universal coverage challenges require health system approaches; the case of India,Antonio Duran,"This paper uses the case of India to demonstrate that Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is about not only health financing; personal and population services production issues, stewardship of the health system and generation of the necessary resources and inputs need to accompany the health financing proposals. In order to help policy makers address UHC in India and sort out implementation issues, the framework developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the World Health Report 2000 and its subsequent extensions are advocated. The framework includes final goals, generic intermediate objectives and four inter-dependent functions which interact as a system; it can be useful by diagnosing current shortcomings and facilitating the filling up of gaps between functions and goals. Different positions are being defended in India re the preconditions for UHC to succeed. This paper argues that more (public) money will be important, but not enough; it needs to be supplemented with broad interventions at various health system levels. The paper analyzes some of the most important issues in relation to the functions of service production, generation of inputs and the necessary stewardship. It also pays attention to reform implementation, as different from its design, and suggests critical aspects emanating from a review of recent health system reforms. Precisely because of the lack of comparative reference for India, emphasis is made on the need to accompany implementation with analysis, so that the ""solutions"" (""what to do?"", ""how to do it?"") are found through policy analysis and research embedded into flexible implementation. Strengthening ""evidence-to-policy"" links and the intelligence dimension of stewardship/leadership as well as accountability during implementation are considered paramount. Countries facing similar challenges to those faced by India can also benefit from the above approaches."
24324325,Are the somatic mutation and tissue organization field theories of carcinogenesis incompatible?,Simon Rosenfeld,"Two drastically different approaches to understanding the forces driving carcinogenesis have crystallized through years of research. These are the somatic mutation theory (SMT) and the tissue organization field theory (TOFT). The essence of SMT is that cancer is derived from a single somatic cell that has successively accumulated multiple DNA mutations, and that those mutations occur on genes which control cell proliferation and cell cycle. Thus, according to SMT, neoplastic lesions are the results of DNA-level events. Conversely, according to TOFT, carcinogenesis is primarily a problem of tissue organization: carcinogenic agents destroy the normal tissue architecture thus disrupting cell-to-cell signaling and compromising genomic integrity. Hence, in TOFT the DNA mutations are the effect, and not the cause, of the tissue-level events. Cardinal importance of successful resolution of the TOFT versus SMT controversy dwells in the fact that, according to SMT, cancer is a unidirectional and mostly irreversible disease; whereas, according to TOFT, it is curable and reversible. In this paper, our goal is to outline a plausible scenario in which TOFT and SMT can be reconciled using the framework and concepts of the self-organized criticality (SOC), the principle proven to be extremely fruitful in a wide range of disciplines pertaining to natural phenomena, to biological communities, to large-scale social developments, to technological networks, and to many other subjects of research."
24321198,Assessment of cognitive function across pregnancy using CANTAB: a longitudinal study,Diane Farrar,"Significant changes in endogenous plasma hormone levels are required to sustain pregnancy which provides a unique opportunity to study their effect on cognitive function. Four carefully selected tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Test Battery (CANTAB) were administered to assess the cognitive function of a group of 23 women during each trimester of pregnancy and at three months following birth. Test scores were compared with a control group of 24 non-pregnant women. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was administered to assess anxiety and risk of depression. The National Adult Reading Test (NART) was used as a measure of verbal intelligence. Plasma hormone levels were measured at each time-point. The pregnant group scored significantly lower than the control group on the Spatial Recognition Memory (SRM) test at the second trimester and postpartum assessments (p⩽0.004). A significant pregnant group-time interaction (p=0.005) for SRM performance was demonstrated. Compared to their first trimester assessment, the pregnant group scored on average 11.7% less on each subsequent SRM test. The pregnant group reported more symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to the control group (EPDS-4 point increase in mean score at each assessment, p=0.002). There were no plasma hormone levels and test score associations identified. These data suggest SRM performance is adversely affected by pregnancy. Other aspects of executive function seem to be unaffected. Although the pregnant group reported more symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to the control group, analysis indicates that this confounder is not responsible for the SRM differences."
24320872,"Modeling complex metabolic reactions, ecological systems, and financial and legal networks with MIANN models based on Markov-Wiener node descriptors",Aliuska Duardo-Sánchez,"The use of numerical parameters in Complex Network analysis is expanding to new fields of application. At a molecular level, we can use them to describe the molecular structure of chemical entities, protein interactions, or metabolic networks. However, the applications are not restricted to the world of molecules and can be extended to the study of macroscopic nonliving systems, organisms, or even legal or social networks. On the other hand, the development of the field of Artificial Intelligence has led to the formulation of computational algorithms whose design is based on the structure and functioning of networks of biological neurons. These algorithms, called Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), can be useful for the study of complex networks, since the numerical parameters that encode information of the network (for example centralities/node descriptors) can be used as inputs for the ANNs. The Wiener index (W) is a graph invariant widely used in chemoinformatics to quantify the molecular structure of drugs and to study complex networks. In this work, we explore for the first time the possibility of using Markov chains to calculate analogues of node distance numbers/W to describe complex networks from the point of view of their nodes. These parameters are called Markov-Wiener node descriptors of order k(th) (W(k)). Please, note that these descriptors are not related to Markov-Wiener stochastic processes. Here, we calculated the W(k)(i) values for a very high number of nodes (>100,000) in more than 100 different complex networks using the software MI-NODES. These networks were grouped according to the field of application. Molecular networks include the Metabolic Reaction Networks (MRNs) of 40 different organisms. In addition, we analyzed other biological and legal and social networks. These include the Interaction Web Database Biological Networks (IWDBNs), with 75 food webs or ecological systems and the Spanish Financial Law Network (SFLN). The calculated W(k)(i) values were used as inputs for different ANNs in order to discriminate correct node connectivity patterns from incorrect random patterns. The MIANN models obtained present good values of Sensitivity/Specificity (%): MRNs (78/78), IWDBNs (90/88), and SFLN (86/84). These preliminary results are very promising from the point of view of a first exploratory study and suggest that the use of these models could be extended to the high-throughput re-evaluation of connectivity in known complex networks (collation)."
24319434,Getting into the musical zone: trait emotional intelligence and amount of practice predict flow in pianists,Manuela M Marin,"Being ""in flow"" or ""in the zone"" is defined as an extremely focused state of consciousness which occurs during intense engagement in an activity. In general, flow has been linked to peak performances (high achievement) and feelings of intense pleasure and happiness. However, empirical research on flow in music performance is scarce, although it may offer novel insights into the question of why musicians engage in musical activities for extensive periods of time. Here, we focused on individual differences in a group of 76 piano performance students and assessed their flow experience in piano performance as well as their trait emotional intelligence. Multiple regression analysis revealed that flow was predicted by the amount of daily practice and trait emotional intelligence. Other background variables (gender, age, duration of piano training and age of first piano training) were not predictive. To predict high achievement in piano performance (i.e., winning a prize in a piano competition), a seven-predictor logistic regression model was fitted to the data, and we found that the odds of winning a prize in a piano competition were predicted by the amount of daily practice and the age at which piano training began. Interestingly, a positive relationship between flow and high achievement was not supported. Further, we explored the role of musical emotions and musical styles in the induction of flow by a self-developed questionnaire. Results suggest that besides individual differences among pianists, specific structural and compositional features of musical pieces and related emotional expressions may facilitate flow experiences. Altogether, these findings highlight the role of emotion in the experience of flow during music performance and call for further experiments addressing emotion in relation to the performer and the music alike."
24319323,Predictors of Response and Mechanisms of Change in an Organizational Skills Intervention for Students with ADHD,Joshua M Langberg,"The purpose of the study was to evaluate predictors of response and mechanisms of change for the Homework, Organization, and Planning Skills (HOPS) intervention for middle school students with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Twenty-three middle school students with ADHD (grades 6-8) received the HOPS intervention implemented by school mental health providers and made significant improvements in parent-rated materials organization and planning skills, impairment due to organizational skills problems, and homework problems. Predictors of response examined included demographic and child characteristics, such as gender, ethnicity, intelligence, ADHD and ODD symptom severity, and ADHD medication use. Mechanisms of change examined included the therapeutic alliance and adoption of the organization and planning skills taught during the HOPS intervention. Participant implementation of the HOPS binder materials organization system and the therapeutic alliance as rated by the student significantly predicted post-intervention outcomes after controlling for pre-intervention severity. Adoption of the binder materials organization system predicted parent-rated improvements in organization, planning, and homework problems above and beyond the impact of the therapeutic alliance. These findings demonstrate the importance of teaching students with ADHD to use a structured binder organization system for organizing and filing homework and classwork materials and for transferring work to and from school."
24318857,National critical incident reporting systems relevant to anaesthesia: a European survey,S Reed,"Background: Critical incident reporting is a key tool in the promotion of patient safety in anaesthesia. Methods: We surveyed representatives of national incident reporting systems in six European countries, inviting information on scope and organization, and intelligence on factors determining success and failure. Results: Some systems are government-run and nationally conceived; others started out as small, specialty-focused initiatives, which have since acquired a national reach. However, both national co-ordination and specialty enthusiasts seem to be necessary for an optimally functioning system. The role of reporting culture, definitional issues, and dissemination is discussed. Conclusions: We make recommendations for others intending to start new systems and speculate on the prospects for sharing patient safety lessons relevant to anaesthesia at European level."
24317790,"Accelerated baccalaureate nursing students use of emotional intelligence in nursing as ""caring for a human being"": a mixed methods grounded theory study",Lisa Sherry Ball,"Accelerated nursing students are ideal informants regarding abstract nursing concepts. How emotional intelligence (EI) is used in nursing remains a relatively elusive process that has yet to be empirically modeled. The purpose of this study was to generate a theoretical model that explains how EI is used in nursing by accelerated baccalaureate nursing students. Using a mixed methods grounded theory study design, theoretical sampling of EI scores directed sampling for individual interviews and focus groups. Caring for a human being emerged as the basic social process at the heart of which all other processes--Getting it; Being caring; The essence of professional nurse caring; Doing something to make someone feel better; and Dealing with difficulty--are interconnected. In addition to a theoretical explanation of the use of EI in nursing, this study corroborates findings from other qualitative studies in nursing and contributes a rich description of accelerated baccalaureate nursing students and an example of a mixed methods study design to the small but growing literature in these areas."
24315583,I-DNASE21 system: development and SWGDAM validation of a new STR 21-plex reaction,Jose María Aznar,"I-DNASE21 is a new STR multiplex system that amplifies 21 STR autosomal loci, plus the amelogenin locus in one reaction. This system has been designed to analyze all the STR loci included in the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), Interpol Standard Set of Loci (ISSL), Extended European Standard Set (ESS-Extended), UK National Criminal Intelligence DNA Database (NDNAD) and German Core loci (GCL). This manuscript presents the validation of the I-DNASE21 system according to the revised guidelines issued by the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM). The results of this validation, added to the extremely high discriminatory power showed, suggest that I-DNASE21 could be a potentially helpful tool for identification and kinship determination even in complex paternity cases."
24315582,Familial searching: a specialist forensic DNA profiling service utilising the National DNA Database to identify unknown offenders via their relatives--the UK experience,C N Maguire,"The National DNA Database (NDNAD) of England and Wales was established on April 10th 1995. The NDNAD is governed by a variety of legislative instruments that mean that DNA samples can be taken if an individual is arrested and detained in a police station. The biological samples and the DNA profiles derived from them can be used for purposes related to the prevention and detection of crime, the investigation of an offence and for the conduct of a prosecution. Following the South East Asian Tsunami of December 2004, the legislation was amended to allow the use of the NDNAD to assist in the identification of a deceased person or of a body part where death has occurred from natural causes or from a natural disaster. The UK NDNAD now contains the DNA profiles of approximately 6 million individuals representing 9.6% of the UK population. As the science of DNA profiling advanced, the National DNA Database provided a potential resource for increased intelligence beyond the direct matching for which it was originally created. The familial searching service offered to the police by several UK forensic science providers exploits the size and geographic coverage of the NDNAD and the fact that close relatives of an offender may share a significant proportion of that offender's DNA profile and will often reside in close geographic proximity to him or her. Between 2002 and 2011 Forensic Science Service Ltd. (FSS) provided familial search services to support 188 police investigations, 70 of which are still active cases. This technique, which may be used in serious crime cases or in 'cold case' reviews when there are few or no investigative leads, has led to the identification of 41 perpetrators or suspects. In this paper we discuss the processes, utility, and governance of the familial search service in which the NDNAD is searched for close genetic relatives of an offender who has left DNA evidence at a crime scene, but whose DNA profile is not represented within the NDNAD. We discuss the scientific basis of the familial search approach, other DNA-based methods for eliminating individuals from the candidate lists generated by these NDNAD searches, the value of filtering these lists by age, ethnic appearance and geography and the governance required by the NDNAD Strategy Board when a police force commissions a familial search. We present the FSS data in relation to the utility of the familial searching service and demonstrate the power of the technique by reference to casework examples. We comment on the uptake of familial searching of DNA databases in the USA, the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand. Finally, following the adverse ruling by the European Court of Human Rights against the UK in regard to the S & Marper cases and the consequent introduction of the Protection of Freedoms Act (2012), we discuss the impact that changes to regulations concerning the storage of DNA samples will have on the continuing provision of familial searching of the National DNA Database in England and Wales."
24314521,"Impact of reaction parameters on the chemical profile of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine synthesized via reductive amination: target analysis based on GC-qMS compared to non-targeted analysis based on GC×GC-TOF-MS",M Schäffer,"The most common clandestine manufacturing procedure for the ecstasy derivative 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), is the reductive amination of piperonylmethylketone (PMK) via platinum(IV) oxide/hydrogen. Deviations of the reaction conditions during the synthesis may result in different chemical profiles of the products. The chemical analysis of these profiles is an important objective for forensic drug intelligence. In this work we studied the impact of a systematic variation of the hydrogenation time, the reaction temperature and the precursor batch on the resulting organic chemical profiles of the MDMA bases and MDMA hydrochlorides. Target analysis was based on a gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method which was harmonized during the European project CHAMP.(2) In addition, samples were analyzed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC-TOFMS) and subjected to non-targeted data analysis for a comprehensive analysis of the complete profiles. The reaction temperature, followed by the used precursor batch, revealed the highest impact on the chemical profile. The effect on individual impurity compounds is discussed in detail. With respect to the interpretation of the data, the profiles were compared to the profiles of MDMA samples obtained by reductive amination using sodium borohydride (""cold method"") and aluminium/mercury amalgam as alternative reducing agents. Non-targeted analysis revealed that the discrimination according to the synthetic route and the batch of precursor used for the synthesis strongly depends on the selected target compounds."
24313878,Predicting young adult outcome among more and less cognitively able individuals with autism spectrum disorders,Deborah K Anderson,"Background: The range of outcomes for young adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and the early childhood factors associated with this diversity have implications for clinicians and scientists. Methods: This prospective study provided a unique opportunity to predict outcome 17 years later for a relatively large sample of children diagnosed with ASD at 2 years old. Diagnostic and psychometric instruments were administered between 2 and 19 with data from 2, 3, and 19 included in this study. Clinicians administered tests without knowledge of previous assessments whenever possible. Caregivers provided additional information through questionnaires. Results: Significant intellectual disabilities at 19 were predicted by age 2 about 85% of the time from VIQ and NVIQ scores together, though prediction of young adult outcome for youths with average or higher intelligence was more complex. By 19, 9% of participants had largely overcome core difficulties associated with ASD and no longer retained a diagnosis. These youths with Very Positive Outcomes were more likely to have participated in treatment and had a greater reduction in repetitive behaviors between age 2 and 3 compared to other Cognitively Able youths (VIQ ≥70) with ASD. Very Positive Outcome youths did not differ phenotypically from Cognitively Able ASD individuals at 2 but both groups differed from Cognitively Less Able individuals (VIQ <70). Conclusion: Those most at risk for intellectual disabilities and ASD can be reliably identified at an early age to receive comprehensive treatment. Findings also suggest that some cognitively able children with ASD who participate in early intervention have very positive outcomes, although replication with randomized, larger samples is needed. In order to improve understanding of very positive outcomes in ASD, future research will need to identify how variations in child characteristics and environmental factors contribute to the nature and timing of growth across individuals and areas of development."
24313635,"Diagnostic delays in children with early onset epilepsy: impact, reasons, and opportunities to improve care",Anne T Berg,"Purpose: Delayed diagnosis of early onset epilepsy is a potentially important and avoidable complication in epilepsy care. We examined the frequency of diagnostic delays in young children with newly presenting epilepsy, their developmental impact, and reasons for delays. Methods: Children who developed epilepsy before their third birthday were identified in a prospective community-based cohort. An interval ≥1 month from second seizure to diagnosis was considered a delay. Testing of development at baseline and for up to 3 years after and of intelligence quotient (IQ) 8-9 years later was performed. Detailed parental baseline interview accounts and medical records were reviewed to identify potential reasons for delays. Factors associated with delays included the parent, child, pediatrician, neurologist, and scheduling. Results: Diagnostic delays occurred in 70 (41%) of 172 children. Delays occurred less often if children had received medical attention for the first seizure (p < 0.0001), previously had neonatal or febrile seizures (p = 0.02), had only convulsions before diagnosis (p = 0.005), or had a college-educated parent (p = 0.01). A ≥1 month diagnostic delay was associated with an average 7.4 point drop (p = 0.02) in the Vineland Scales of Adaptive Behavior motor score. The effect was present at diagnosis, persisted for at least 3 years, and was also apparent in IQ scores 8-9 years later, which were lower in association with a diagnostic delay by 8.4 points (p = 0.06) for processing speed up to 14.5 points (p = 0.004) for full scale IQ, after adjustment for parental education and other epilepsy-related clinical factors. Factors associated with delayed diagnosis included parents not recognizing events as seizures (N = 47), pediatricians missing or deferring diagnosis (N = 15), neurologists deferring diagnosis (N = 7), and scheduling problems (N = 11). Significance: Diagnostic delays occur in many young children with epilepsy. They are associated with substantial decrements in development and IQ later in childhood. Several factors influence diagnostic delays and may represent opportunities for intervention and improved care."
24313598,Relation between remission status and attention in patients with schizophrenia,Motoyuki Fukumoto,"Aim: Patients with schizophrenia in remission have shown significantly higher levels of neurocognitive function than patients not in remission. However, previous studies have mainly examined the association between neurocognitive function and the remission status of schizophrenia without considering the time component of the definition for remission using cross-sectional methods. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relations between remission status with considering time components and three cognitive functions of intellectual ability, memory and attention, which were examined before fulfilling the remission criteria, using longitudinal methods. Methods: We assessed the remission status using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) on the same patients twice: at recruitment and at 6 months after the first PANSS assessment. Cognitive tests were performed within 3 months after recruitment. At recruitment, 337 patients were enrolled. Of the patients, 63 patients were followed up and completedthe first and second PANSS assessments and three cognitive tests at the end of study. Results: Of the patients, 33 patients fulfilled the remission criteria, while 30 patients did not fulfill the criteria. Patients in remission showed significantly higher levels of 2-digit (P = 0.020) and 3-digit (P = 0.015) Continuous Performance Test scores, attention/concentration in the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (P = 0.034) and processing speeds in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (P = 0.047) than patients not in remission. Additionally, these cognitive scores were positively correlated with each other (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that patients who achieve remission may demonstrate a pre-existing higher level of attention than patients who do not achieve remission."
24313565,"Impaired emotional state, quality of life and cognitive functions in young hypogonadal men",L Lašaitė,"The study aimed to analyse emotional state, quality of life and cognitive functions in young hypogonadal men. Thirty-four males with hypogonadism (age 29.1 ± 10.5 years) and 34 age-matched healthy males (age 30.5 ± 11.0 years) were recruited. Their emotional state was evaluated by Profile of Mood States, quality of life - by WHO Brief Quality of Life Questionnaire - and cognitive functioning - by Trail Making Test and Digit Span Test of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. It was found that young men with hypogonadism had higher depression-dejection (13.1 ± 8.8 versus 7.4 ± 5.9, P = 0.003), fatigue-inertia (10.0 ± 5.8 versus 7.0 ± 4.9, P = 0.030), confusion-bewilderment (5.1 ± 4.6 versus 2.3 ± 3.1, P = 0.004) and lower vigour-activity (14.3 ± 5.1 versus 17.7 ± 4.3, P = 0.008) levels than age- and sex-matched controls. Quality of life psychological (13.1 ± 2.8 versus 15.1 ± 1.9, P = 0.005) and social (13.6 ± 2.4 versus 15.7 ± 2.0, P < 0.001) domains were significantly worse in men with hypogonadism than in controls. Cognitive functions were significantly worse (P < 0.001) in men with hypogonadism than in controls, showing worse executive function, attention, visual scanning abilities and psychomotor speed. A significant correlation was found between testosterone concentration and quality of life psychological domain. Cognitive functioning scores were significantly related with FT4 concentration. It is concluded that young hypogonadal patients have impaired emotional state and quality of life, but the most severe impairment was found in cognitive functioning."
24312240,Planning steps forward in development: in girls earlier than in boys,Josef M Unterrainer,"The development of planning ability in children initially aged four and five was examined longitudinally with a retest-interval of 12 months using the Tower of London task. As expected, problems to solve straightforward without mental look-ahead were mastered by most, even the youngest children. Problems demanding look-ahead were more difficult and accuracy improved significantly with age and over time. This development was strongly moderated by sex: In contrast to coeval boys, four year old girls showed an impressive performance enhancement at age five, reaching the performance of six year olds, whereas four year old boys lagged behind and caught up with girls at the age of six, the typical age of school enrollment. This sex-specific development of planning was clearly separated from overall intelligence: young boys showed a steeper increase in raw intelligence scores than girls, whereas in the older groups scores developed similarly. The observed sex differences in planning development are evident even within a narrow time window of twelve months and may relate to differences in maturational trajectories for girls and boys in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex."
24311027,"Bulimia nervosa patient diagnosed with previously unsuspected ADHD in adulthood: clinical case report, literature review, and diagnostic challenges",Konstantinos Ioannidis,"There is increasing literature suggesting a link between attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and eating disorders (EDs), especially bulimia nervosa. ADHD is under-diagnosed in girls and children of high intelligence are typically missed. We identified a case of a 23-year-old woman suffering from severe bulimia nervosa and previously unsuspected ADHD in adulthood; we diagnosed and treated her with extended-release methylphenidate. We performed a literature review on the ADHD and bulimia nervosa comorbidity. We discuss the reasons why her ADHD remained undiagnosed and the difficulties in diagnosing ADHD in patients with EDs. We suggest that identifying comorbid ADHD is crucial for these patients and argue for the use of a structured interview, collateral history and investigation of onset of symptoms to establish a diagnosis of ADHD in adults with bulimia nervosa. Comorbidities and overlap of symptomatology need to be taken into account."
24305033,Long-term effects of stimulants on neurocognitive performance of Taiwanese children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,Ching-Shu Tsai,"Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common behavioral and neurocognitive disorder in school-age children. Methylphenidate (MPH) is the most frequently prescribed CNS stimulant for ADHD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the changes in intelligence quotient and domains of neurocognitive function after long-term MPH treatment of Taiwanese children with ADHD. Methods: The Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WISC-III) was administrated twice at an interval of at least one year for all 171 subjects (6-12 years) and 47 age- and gender-matched children without ADHD. The ADHD-Rating scale and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) were also used at the time of enrolment, and at 6 months and one year later. Results: Taiwanese children with ADHD had lower Verbal IQ (VIQ) and Full IQ (FIQ) and performed poorly on several subtests of the WISC-III, including Similarities, Vocabulary, and Coding, compared to healthy children without ADHD. After one year of MPH treatment, significant decrements in all scores of the ADHD-Rating scale and CGI-S and increments in several domains of the WISC-III, including FIQ, VIQ, PIQ, Perceptual Organization Index (POI), Picture Completion, Picture Arrangement, Object Assembly, and Digit Span were observed. When the ADHD children under MPH treatment were subdivided into two age groups (6-8 years and 9-12 years), significantly better performance in some subtests and subscales of the WISC-III (such as Similarities, Comprehension, and Object assembly) was found in the 6-8 years age group. Conclusions: Long-term MPH treatment may improve the neurocognitive profiles of the ADHD children, as seen in their performance in several subtests and in the IQ scores on the WISC-III. And this improvement had no correlation with the decrement of ADHD symptoms. Starting stimulant treatment at as young an age as possible is advised due to the greater benefits in the 6-8 years age group, as seen in this study. More research in this area is also needed to confirm these results."
24304439,Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors: a model for examining the effects of pathology versus seizures on cognitive dysfunction in epilepsy,Sallie Baxendale,"Purpose: Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs) provide a unique model for studying the effects of seizures on cognitive development. Epilepsy and antiepileptic medications are prominent features in the lives and schooling of people who develop seizures in childhood. People with an adult onset share the same underlying brain pathology, but their childhood development is unaffected by seizures. Therefore, DNTs provide a model to examine the specific influence of seizures and their treatment on cognitive development, over and above the effects of the underlying pathology in epilepsy. Methods: We examined the neuropsychological characteristics of 56 adults with DNT and medically intractable epilepsy (mean age 32.7 years). Twenty-two adults (39%) had an age of onset of epilepsy before the age of 12 years (childhood-onset group). Scores on tests of intelligence (Verbal IQ and Performance IQ), reading, working memory, verbal learning, verbal recall, visual learning, and expressive and receptive language ability were analyzed. Key findings: There were no significant localization effects (right vs. left vs. extratemporal) on any of the neuropsychological test scores. In the group as a whole, the neuropsychological test scores were significantly lower than healthy, age-matched controls on measures of Verbal IQ (p < 0.01), naming p < 0.01, verbal learning (p < 0.01), and working memory (p < 0.05). The childhood-onset group had significantly lower scores on the measures of Verbal IQ (p < 0.01), Performance IQ (p < 0.05), reading (p < 0.05), naming (p = 0.05), and verbal retention (p < 0.05) than those with an onset of seizures at the age of 12 or older. Significance: The traditional pattern of lateralized memory deficits seen in people with hippocampal sclerosis may not be present in people with temporal lobe epilepsy associated with a DNT. The presence of seizures and their treatment in early childhood may adversely influence the development of these core cognitive abilities, resulting in patterns of cognitive deficits that remain apparent in adulthood."
24304435,Neurobehavioral comorbidities of pediatric epilepsies are linked to thalamic structural abnormalities,Jack J Lin,"Purpose: Neurobehavioral comorbidities are common in pediatric epilepsy with enduring adverse effects on functioning, but their neuroanatomic underpinning is unclear. Striatal and thalamic abnormalities have been associated with childhood-onset epilepsies, suggesting that epilepsy-related changes in the subcortical circuit might be associated with the comorbidities of children with epilepsy. We aimed to compare subcortical volumes and their relationship with age in children with complex partial seizures (CPS), childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), and healthy controls (HC). We examined the shared versus unique structural-functional relationships of these volumes with behavior problems, intelligence, language, peer interaction, and epilepsy variables in these two epilepsy syndromes. Methods: We investigated volumetric differences of caudate, putamen, pallidum, and thalamus in children with CPS (N = 21), CAE (N = 20), and HC (N = 27). Study subjects underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), intelligence, and language testing. Parent-completed Child Behavior Checklists provided behavior problem and peer interaction scores. We examined the association of age, intelligence quotient (IQ), language, behavioral problems, and epilepsy variables with subcortical volumes that were significantly different between the children with epilepsy and HC. Key findings: Both children with CPS and CAE exhibited significantly smaller left thalamic volume compared to HC. In terms of developmental trajectory, greater thalamic volume was significantly correlated with increasing age in children with CPS and CAE but not in HC. With regard to the comorbidities, reduced left thalamic volumes were related to more social problems in children with CPS and CAE. Smaller left thalamic volumes in children with CPS were also associated with poor attention, lower IQ and language scores, and impaired peer interaction. Significance: Our study is the first to directly compare and detect shared thalamic structural abnormalities in children with CPS and CAE. These findings highlight the vulnerability of the thalamus and provide important new insights on its possible role in the neurobehavioral comorbidities of childhood-onset epilepsy."
24303769,Statistical prediction methods in violence risk assessment and its application],Yuan-Yuan Liu,"It is an urgent global problem how to improve the violence risk assessment. As a necessary part of risk assessment, statistical methods have remarkable impacts and effects. In this study, the predicted methods in violence risk assessment from the point of statistics are reviewed. The application of Logistic regression as the sample of multivariate statistical model, decision tree model as the sample of data mining technique, and neural networks model as the sample of artificial intelligence technology are all reviewed. This study provides data in order to contribute the further research of violence risk assessment."
24303578,"Gender, g, gender identity concepts, and self-constructs as predictors of the self-estimated IQ",Josephine Storek,"In all 102 participants completed 2 intelligence tests, a self-estimated domain-masculine (DMIQ) intelligence rating (which is a composite of self-rated mathematical-logical and spatial intelligence), a measure of self-esteem, and of self-control. The aim was to confirm and extend previous findings about the role of general intelligence and gender identity in self-assessed intelligence. It aimed to examine further correlates of the Hubris-Humility Effect that shows men believe they are more intelligent than women. The DMIQ scores were correlated significantly with gender, psychometrically assessed IQ, and masculinity but not self-esteem or self-control. Stepwise regressions indicated that gender and gender role were the strongest predictors of DMIQ accounting for a third of the variance."
24302930,A functional model of sensemaking in a neurocognitive architecture,Christian Lebiere,"Sensemaking is the active process of constructing a meaningful representation (i.e., making sense) of some complex aspect of the world. In relation to intelligence analysis, sensemaking is the act of finding and interpreting relevant facts amongst the sea of incoming reports, images, and intelligence. We present a cognitive model of core information-foraging and hypothesis-updating sensemaking processes applied to complex spatial probability estimation and decision-making tasks. While the model was developed in a hybrid symbolic-statistical cognitive architecture, its correspondence to neural frameworks in terms of both structure and mechanisms provided a direct bridge between rational and neural levels of description. Compared against data from two participant groups, the model correctly predicted both the presence and degree of four biases: confirmation, anchoring and adjustment, representativeness, and probability matching. It also favorably predicted human performance in generating probability distributions across categories, assigning resources based on these distributions, and selecting relevant features given a prior probability distribution. This model provides a constrained theoretical framework describing cognitive biases as arising from three interacting factors: the structure of the task environment, the mechanisms and limitations of the cognitive architecture, and the use of strategies to adapt to the dual constraints of cognition and the environment."
24296286,Cognitively inspired reinforcement learning architecture and its application to giant-swing motion control,Daisuke Uragami,"Many algorithms and methods in artificial intelligence or machine learning were inspired by human cognition. As a mechanism to handle the exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning, the loosely symmetric (LS) value function that models causal intuition of humans was proposed (Shinohara et al., 2007). While LS shows the highest correlation with causal induction by humans, it has been reported that it effectively works in multi-armed bandit problems that form the simplest class of tasks representing the dilemma. However, the scope of application of LS was limited to the reinforcement learning problems that have K actions with only one state (K-armed bandit problems). This study proposes LS-Q learning architecture that can deal with general reinforcement learning tasks with multiple states and delayed reward. We tested the learning performance of the new architecture in giant-swing robot motion learning, where uncertainty and unknown-ness of the environment is huge. In the test, the help of ready-made internal models or functional approximation of the state space were not given. The simulations showed that while the ordinary Q-learning agent does not reach giant-swing motion because of stagnant loops (local optima with low rewards), LS-Q escapes such loops and acquires giant-swing. It is confirmed that the smaller number of states is, in other words, the more coarse-grained the division of states and the more incomplete the state observation is, the better LS-Q performs in comparison with Q-learning. We also showed that the high performance of LS-Q depends comparatively little on parameter tuning and learning time. This suggests that the proposed method inspired by human cognition works adaptively in real environments."
24295537,"Psychopathy, intelligence, and impulsivity in German violent offenders",Fanny de Tribolet-Hardy,"Previous studies have reported numerous correlations between psychopathy and various personality traits, behavioural tendencies or clinical characteristics. The present study examined in greater depth the relationships between the components of psychopathy as measured by the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) and intelligence as well as impulsivity. A total of ninety male violent offenders were recruited from a prison and a forensic-psychiatric hospital in Germany. All of the subjects were assessed using the PCL-R, the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), and a short version of the German Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WIP). As expected, a canonical correlation analysis showed a negative association between spatial intelligence and the Factor 2 subtotal on the PCL-R (reckless lifestyle/antisociality). In addition, our results agreed with the assumption of an association between impulsivity and the subtotal for PCL-R Factor 2. The positive relationship between verbal intelligence and the subtotal for Factor 1 of the PCL-R (insincere, manipulative conduct/affective deficits) vanished after controlling for educational level. The results indicate that there is a relationship between the spatial components of intelligence and the concept of psychopathy as described by Hare. This result supports the spatial impairment aetiological model of antisocial behaviour."
24295424,Executive functioning in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients without comorbidities: focus on the fractionation of executive functions,Juliane Goldoni Borges,"Purpose: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with impaired cognition, especially executive functions. However, various of its comorbid conditions are also known to cause cognitive impairment, so it is unclear whether OSAS itself is responsible for cognitive deficits. Our aim was to determine the effects of OSAS on executive functions in otherwise healthy patients. Method: This was a parallel group design study, which involved 22 patients aged 36-65 years diagnosed with moderate to severe OSAS, whose body mass index was below 26, and who did not have diabetes, hypertension, or depression. Controls were 22 healthy individuals with similar age, gender, intelligence quotient, and schooling to those of the patients. Participants completed a test battery that included measures of 6 distinct executive domains (shifting, inhibition, updating, dual-task performance, planning, and access to long-term memory), of all subsystems of the multiple-component working memory model, attention, and mood. Results: OSAS and controls were equivalent in all demographic variables and test scores. The apnea-hypopnea index did not significantly correlate with executive performance, but mean oxygen saturation did so with measurements of executive shifting and access to long-term memory. Conclusions: OSAS without comorbidities did not lead to cognitive impairment."
24293310,Neuropsychological findings in childhood narcolepsy,Annio Posar,"Narcolepsy with cataplexy is a severely disabling disorder very often arising in childhood. Data on neuropsychological impairment in children are scant. We administered standardized neuropsychological tests to 13 children with narcolepsy with cataplexy. Overall, our patients displayed multiple patterns of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction, and often academic failure (7 cases out of 13). All children had a normal full intelligence quotient (IQ), but 3 patients presented a significantly higher and 2 a significantly lower Verbal IQ compared to Performance IQ, respectively. Mean sleep latency was significantly correlated (P < .05) to alertness functions. Eight patients displayed behavioral problems: emotional symptoms and conduct problems prevailed. Childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy represents a risk factor for subtle and heterogeneous cognitive impairments potentially resulting in academic failure, despite the normal IQ. These children also have a certain psychopathological risk. All this seems to be at least partially detached from the direct effects of daytime sleepiness."
24293267,Neural mechanisms of discourse comprehension: a human lesion study,Aron K Barbey,"Discourse comprehension is a hallmark of human social behaviour and refers to the act of interpreting a written or spoken message by constructing mental representations that integrate incoming language with prior knowledge and experience. Here, we report a human lesion study (n = 145) that investigates the neural mechanisms underlying discourse comprehension (measured by the Discourse Comprehension Test) and systematically examine its relation to a broad range of psychological factors, including psychometric intelligence (measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), emotional intelligence (measured by the Mayer, Salovey, Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test), and personality traits (measured by the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Personality Inventory). Scores obtained from these factors were submitted to voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to elucidate their neural substrates. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that working memory and extraversion reliably predict individual differences in discourse comprehension: higher working memory scores and lower extraversion levels predict better discourse comprehension performance. Lesion mapping results indicated that these convergent variables depend on a shared network of frontal and parietal regions, including white matter association tracts that bind these areas into a coordinated system. The observed findings motivate an integrative framework for understanding the neural foundations of discourse comprehension, suggesting that core elements of discourse processing emerge from a distributed network of brain regions that support specific competencies for executive and social function."
24291524,Correlation between interictal cerebral glucose hypometabolism and IQ in children with epilepsy,Zhihong Tang,"The aim of this study was to understand the relationship between IQ and glucose metabolism in brain cells in a wide variety of subjects with epilepsy. The study participants were 78 children with epilepsy and 15 healthy children for comparison. All participants were administered the Chinese Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (C-WISC). The verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ), performance intelligence quotient (PIQ), and full-scale intelligence quotient (FIQ) were compared between children with epilepsy and typically developing children. Seventy-eight patients underwent interictal positron emission computed tomography (PET) using 2-deoxy-2[(18)F]fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) as the tracer for evaluating brain glucose metabolism. Verbal intelligence quotient, PIQ, and FIQ based on the C-WISC were significantly lower in children with epilepsy than those in the healthy comparison group (P<0.001, P=0.001, and P<0.001, respectively). The IQ of patients with normal metabolism, unifocal abnormal hypometabolism, and multifocal abnormal hypometabolism determined by PET differed significantly. The extent of the abnormal hypometabolism was negatively correlated with the FIQ (rs=-0.549, P<0.001). In patients with lateralized hypometabolism based on PET, the VIQ/PIQ discrepancy scores (|VIQ-PIQ|≥15 points) differed significantly between the left hemisphere abnormal hypometabolism and right hemisphere abnormal hypometabolism subgroups, with negative values in the left and positive values in the right subgroups (P=0.004). In conclusion, brain metabolic abnormalities are correlated with IQ, and performing interictal PET along with C-WISC can better assess the extent of severity of cognitive impairment and VIQ/PIQ discrepancy."
24291503,"The SEMA5A gene is associated with hippocampal volume, and their interaction is associated with performance on Raven's Progressive Matrices",Bi Zhu,"The Allen Brain Atlas shows that the semaphorin 5A (SEMA5A) gene, which encodes an important protein for neurogenesis and neuronal apoptosis, is predominantly expressed in the human hippocampus. Structural and functional neuroimaging studies have further shown that the hippocampus plays an important role in the performance on Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), a measure of reasoning ability and general fluid intelligence. Thus far, however, no study has examined the relationships between the SEMA5A gene polymorphism, hippocampal volume, and RPM performance. The current study collected both structural MRI, genetic, and behavioral data in 329 healthy Chinese adults, and examined associations between SEMA5A variants, hippocampal volume, and performance on RAPM (the advanced form of RPM). After controlling for intracranial volume (ICV), sex, and age, SEMA5A genetic polymorphism at the SNP rs42352 had the strongest association with hippocampal volume (p=0.00000552 and 0.000103 for right and left hippocampal volumes, respectively), with TT homozygotes having higher hippocampal volume than the other genotypes. Furthermore, there was a high correlation between right hippocampal volume and RAPM performance (r=0.42, p=0.0000509) for SEMA5A rs42352 TT homozygotes. This study provides the first evidence for the involvement of the SEMA5A gene in hippocampal structure and their interaction on RAPM performance. Future studies of the hippocampus-RPM associations should consider genetic factors as potential moderators."
24291026,Array CGH analysis of a cohort of Russian patients with intellectual disability,Anna A Kashevarova,"The use of array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) as a diagnostic tool in molecular genetics has facilitated the identification of many new microdeletion/microduplication syndromes (MMSs). Furthermore, this method has allowed for the identification of copy number variations (CNVs) whose pathogenic role has yet to be uncovered. Here, we report on our application of array CGH for the identification of pathogenic CNVs in 79 Russian children with intellectual disability (ID). Twenty-six pathogenic or likely pathogenic changes in copy number were detected in 22 patients (28%): 8 CNVs corresponded to known MMSs, and 17 were not associated with previously described syndromes. In this report, we describe our findings and comment on genes potentially associated with ID that are located within the CNV regions."
24290921,Support vector machine algorithms in the search of KIR gene associations with disease,Juan C Cuevas Tello,"Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are membrane proteins expressed by natural killer cells and CD8 lymphocytes. The KIR system consists of 17 genes and 614 alleles, some of which bind human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Both KIR and HLA modulate susceptibility to haematological malignancies, viral infections and autoimmune diseases. Molecular epidemiology studies employ traditional statistical methods to identify links between KIR genes and disease. Here we describe our results at applying artificial intelligence algorithms (support vector machines) to identify associations between KIR genes and disease. We demonstrate that these algorithms are capable of classifying samples into healthy and diseased groups based solely on KIR genotype with potential use in clinical decision support systems."
24289983,The relation between cognitive and motor performance and their relevance for children's transition to school: a latent variable approach,Claudia M Roebers,"Both theoretically and empirically there is a continuous interest in understanding the specific relation between cognitive and motor development in childhood. In the present longitudinal study including three measurement points, this relation was targeted. At the beginning of the study, the participating children were 5-6-year-olds. By assessing participants' fine motor skills, their executive functioning, and their non-verbal intelligence, their cross-sectional and cross-lagged interrelations were examined. Additionally, performance in these three areas was used to predict early school achievement (in terms of mathematics, reading, and spelling) at the end of participants' first grade. Correlational analyses and structural equation modeling revealed that fine motor skills, non-verbal intelligence and executive functioning were significantly interrelated. Both fine motor skills and intelligence had significant links to later school achievement. However, when executive functioning was additionally included into the prediction of early academic achievement, fine motor skills and non-verbal intelligence were no longer significantly associated with later school performance suggesting that executive functioning plays an important role for the motor-cognitive performance link."
27000477,Neuropsychological assessment before and after radiotherapy in a child with an intracranial tumor: case report,Alessandra Pereira Lopes,"Introduction: Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors and the second largest group of neoplasms diagnosed in childhood. Treatment includes surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, radiotherapy can cause complications, e.g., cognitive deficits. Case description: We describe the case of a child diagnosed with a brain tumor evaluated before and after radiotherapy to investigate cognitive decline after treatment. The results showed a decline in Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores and reversal of the predominance of verbal and nonverbal skills. After radiotherapy, the subject showed slowness, academic deficits, and difficulties learning new information. Comments: Even though the post-treatment evaluation showed scores compatible with the average, comparison between pre- and post-treatment evaluations demonstrated the impact of radiotherapy on the subject's cognitive profile. These results highlight the importance of evaluating patients who undergo radiotherapy before and after treatment and understanding neuropsychological scores associated with the subjects' complaints."
26494932,Effects of an emotional literacy intervention for students identified with bullying behaviour,Claire Knowler,"The effectiveness of a 12-week, small group emotional literacy (EL) intervention in reducing bullying behaviour in school was evaluated. Participants were 50 primary school pupils identified through peer nomination as engaging in bullying behaviours. The intervention was implemented in schools already engaged with a universal social and emotional learning initiative, including an anti-bullying component. Within schools, participants were randomly assigned to an intervention or a wait-list comparison group. Response to the intervention was found to be dependent on baseline levels of EL. Only children whose baseline level was low showed a significant reduction in peer-rated bullying behaviour. No effect of the intervention was detected on victimisation or adjustment scores, although positive changes in adjustment were associated with increased EL."
24288472,Intelligence deficits in Chinese patients with brain tumor: the impact of tumor resection,Chao Shen,"Background: Intelligence is much important for brain tumor patients after their operation, while the reports about surgical related intelligence deficits are not frequent. It is not only theoretically important but also meaningful for clinical practice. Methods: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale was employed to evaluate the intelligence of 103 patients with intracranial tumor and to compare the intelligence quotient (IQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), and performance IQ (PIQ) between the intracerebral and extracerebral subgroups. Results: Although preoperative intelligence deficits appeared in all subgroups, IQ, VIQ, and PIQ were not found to have any significant difference between the intracerebral and extracerebral subgroups, but with VIQ lower than PIQ in all the subgroups. An immediate postoperative follow-up demonstrated a decline of IQ and PIQ in the extracerebral subgroup, but an improvement of VIQ in the right intracerebral subgroup. Pituitary adenoma resection exerted no effect on intelligence. In addition, age, years of education, and tumor size were found to play important roles. Conclusions: Brain tumors will impair IQ, VIQ, and PIQ. The extracerebral tumor resection can deteriorate IQ and PIQ. However, right intracerebral tumor resection is beneficial to VIQ, and transsphenoidal pituitary adenoma resection performs no effect on intelligence."
24286093,Solid parotid tumors: an individual and integrative analysis of various ultrasonographic criteria. A prospective and observational study,Alexandru Florin Badea,"Objectives: The purpose of the study is to identify and validate ultrasound criteria for parotid tumors evaluation, as well as to elaborate a multimodal, multi-criteria and integrative ultrasound approach for allowing tumor discrimination in a non-invasive manner. Material and method: Twenty patients with solid parotid tumors (12 benign, 8 malignant) were examined by ultrasound: real-time ""grey scale"" ultrasound, Doppler ultrasound, elastography, harmonic ultrasound imaging with i.v. contrast (CEUS). The study focused on tumor morphology and circulation. The analysis of the results was observational, enhanced by statistical methods and artificial intelligence (decision trees). Results: All malignant tumors showed increased hypoechogenicity, tumoral cervical adenopathies, increased stiffness and ""in block"" mobility with the parotid gland upon palpation with the transducer, uneven distribution of the contrast material during the arterial phase (8/8). To varying degrees, they showed imprecise delineation (7/8), structural heterogeneity (6/8) and disorganized flow pattern (6/8). All cases of benign tumors showed heterogeneous echostructure, clear delineation and no capsule (12). They also showed moderate hypoechogenicity (9/12), no cervical lymph nodes (11/12) and variable rigidity (increased 6/12; low 3/12). A selection and ranking of relevant ultrasound parameters was also made. Some of them were included in a transparent and easy-to-use decision tree model with 100% data accuracy. Conclusions: The characterization and discrimination of solid parotid tumors require a multimodal and multicriteria approach. Ultrasound criteria can be divided into criteria of certainty and criteria of diagnosis probability. CEUS examination of parotid tumors did not reveal significant differences between benign and malignant circulatory bed. Decision trees discovered by artificial intelligence from the data may represent intelligent diagnosis support systems with very high accuracy, up to 100%."
24286066,Cognitive Performance in Men and Women Infected with HIV-1,José María Faílde Garrido,"Introduction. Very few studies have examined the neuropsychological performance of HIV-positive women, and even fewer have attempted a comparison of cognitive functioning by gender. The aim of this study was to describe the nature of the neuropsychological performance of HIV seropositive patients by gender. Methods. A clinical sample made up of 151 subjects was recruited to participate in this study. All of the subjects underwent the same assessment process, consisting of a neuropsychological evaluation and an interview to gather sociodemographic, toxicological, and clinical data. Results and Discussion. Despite the fact that men obtained higher scores in visual memory, attention/psychomotor speed, and abstract reasoning/verbal intelligence, these differences were not statistically significant. In contrast, significant differences were found depending on subjects' serological status. Seropositive participants' neuropsychological performance was significantly lower than that of the seronegative participants in all of the areas assessed as follows: (1) visual memory; (2) attention/psychomotor speed; (3) abstract reasoning/verbal intelligence; (4) verbal memory for texts; (5) verbal memory for digits and words. Conclusions. The results from this study reveal no significant gender differences in the cognitive performance of patients infected with HIV-1."
24285080,Abstract rule neurons in the endbrain support intelligent behaviour in corvid songbirds,Lena Veit,"Despite the lack of a layered neocortex and fundamental differences in endbrain organization in birds compared with mammals, intelligent species evolved from both vertebrate classes. Among birds, corvids show exceptional cognitive flexibility. Here we explore the neuronal foundation of corvid cognition by recording single-unit activity from an association area known as the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) while carrion crows make flexible rule-guided decisions, a hallmark of executive control functions. The most prevalent activity in NCL represents the behavioural rules, while abstracting over sample images and sensory modalities of the rule cues. Rule coding is weaker in error trials, thus predicting the crows' behavioural decisions. This suggests that the abstraction of general principles may be an important function of the NCL, mirroring the function of primate prefrontal cortex. These findings emphasize that intelligence in vertebrates does not necessarily rely on a neocortex but can be realized in endbrain circuitries that developed independently via convergent evolution."
24284030,The one and the many: effects of the cell adhesion molecule pathway on neuropsychological function in psychosis,A Hargreaves,"Background: Genetic studies of single gene variants have been criticized as providing a simplistic characterization of the genetic basis of illness risk that ignores the effects of other variants within the same biological pathways. Of candidate biological pathways for schizophrenia (SZ), the cell adhesion molecule (CAM) pathway has repeatedly been linked to both psychosis and neurocognitive dysfunction. Here we tested, using risk allele scores derived from the Schizophrenia Psychiatric Genome-Wide Association Study Consortium (PGC-SCZ), whether alleles within the CAM pathway were correlated with poorer neuropsychological function in patients. Method: In total, 424 patients with psychosis were assessed in areas of cognitive ability typically found to be impaired in SZ: intelligence quotient, memory, working memory and attentional control. CAM pathway genes were identified using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Alleles within these genes identified as significantly associated with SZ risk in the PGC-SCZ were then used to calculate a CAM pathway-based polygenic risk allele score for each patient and these scores were tested for association with cognitive ability. Results: Increased CAM pathway polygenic risk scores were significantly associated with poorer performance on measures of memory and attention, explaining 1-3% of variation on these measures. Notably, the most strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CAM pathway (rs9272105 within HLA-DQA1) explained a similar amount of variance in attentional control, but not memory, as the polygenic risk analysis. Conclusions: These data support a role for the CAM pathway in cognitive function, both at the level of individual SNPs and the wider pathway. In so doing these data highlight the value of pathway-based polygenic risk score studies as well as single gene studies for understanding SZ-associated deficits in cognition."
24281765,Biogenic amines and collective organization in a superorganism: neuromodulation of social behavior in ants,J Frances Kamhi,"The ecological dominance of ants has to a great extent been achieved through their collective action and complex social organization. Ants provide diverse model systems to examine the neural underpinnings of individual behavior and group action that contribute to their evolutionary success. Core elements of ant colony structure such as reproductive and ergonomic division of labor, task specialization, and social integration are beginning to be understood in terms of cellular neuroanatomy and neurochemistry. In this review we discuss the neuroethology of colony organization by focusing on the role of biogenic amines in the control of social behavior in ants. We examine the role of neuromodulation in significant sociobiological characteristics of ants, including reproductive hierarchies, colony foundation, social food flow, nestmate recognition, territoriality, and size- and age-related sensory perception and task performance as well as the involvement of monoamines in collective intelligence, the ultimate key to the global dominance of these remarkable superorganisms. We conclude by suggesting future directions for the analysis of the aminergic regulation of behavior and social complexity in ants."
24280694,A cluster analytic study of the Wechsler Intelligence Test for Children-IV in children referred for psychoeducational assessment due to persistent academic difficulties,Corinne R Hale,"Wechsler Intelligence Test for Children-IV core subtest scores of 472 children were cluster analyzed to determine if reliable and valid subgroups would emerge. Three subgroups were identified. Clusters were reliable across different stages of the analysis as well as across algorithms and samples. With respect to external validity, the Globally Low cluster differed from the other two clusters on Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-II Word Reading, Numerical Operations, and Spelling subtests, whereas the latter two clusters did not differ from one another. The clusters derived have been identified in studies using previous WISC editions. Clusters characterized by poor performance on subtests historically associated with the VIQ (i.e., VCI + WMI) and PIQ (i.e., POI + PSI) did not emerge, nor did a cluster characterized by low scores on PRI subtests. Picture Concepts represented the highest subtest score in every cluster, failing to vary in a predictable manner with the other PRI subtests."
24279481,Neuropsychological profile of duchenne muscular dystrophy,Anna Roshini Perumal,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an inherited myogenic disorder characterized by progressive muscle wasting. DMD is a fatal X-linked recessive disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 3,500 male live births. This disease has long been associated with intellectual impairment. Research has shown that boys with DMD have variable intellectual performance, indicating the presence of specific cognitive deficits. The aim of the study was to use a battery of intelligence, learning, and memory tests to identify a neuropsychological profile in boys with DMD. A total of 22 boys diagnosed with DMD in the age range of 6 to 10 years old were evaluated using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition, Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and the Memory for Designs Test. The data were interpreted using means, standard deviations, percentages, and percentiles. Normative data were also used for further interpretation. The results showed that boys with DMD had a significantly lower IQ (88.5). Verbal IQ (86.59) was found to be lower than Performance IQ (92.64). There was evidence of impaired performance on the Processing Speed, Freedom From Distractibility, and Verbal Comprehension Indexes. Specific deficits in information processing, complex attention, immediate verbal memory span, verbal working memory, verbal comprehension, vocabulary, visuoconstruction ability, and verbal learning and encoding were observed. However, perceptional organization, general fund of information, abstract reasoning, visual discrimination and acuity, visual learning and memory, and verbal memory were adequate. The neuropsychological findings support the hypothesis that these children have specific cognitive deficits as opposed to a global intellectual deficit."
24278878,Effect of complex treatment using visual and auditory stimuli on the symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children,Mi-Sook Park,"We investigated the effects of complex treatment using visual and auditory stimuli on the symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. Forty-seven male children (7-13 yr old), who were clinically diagnosed with ADHD at the Balance Brain Center in Seoul, Korea, were included in this study. The complex treatment consisted of visual and auditory stimuli, core muscle exercise, targeting ball exercise, ocular motor exercise, and visual motor integration. All subjects completed the complex treatment for 60 min/day, 2-3 times/week for more than 12 weeks. Data regarding visual and auditory reaction time and cognitive function were obtained using the Neurosync program, Stroop Color-Word Test, and test of nonverbal intelligence (TONI) at pre- and post-treatment. The complex treatment significantly decreased the total reaction time, while it increased the number of combo actions on visual and auditory stimuli (P< 0.05). The Stroop color, word, and color-word scores were significantly increased at post-treatment compared to the scores at pretreatment (P< 0.05). There was no significant change in the TONI scores, although a tendency toward an increase in these scores was observed. In conclusion, complex treatment using visual and auditory stimuli alleviated the symptoms of ADHD and improved cognitive function in children. In addition, visual and auditory function might be possible indicators for demonstrating effective ADHD intervention."
24275680,"Hysteria, race, and phlogiston. A model of ontological elimination in the human sciences",David Ludwig,"Elimination controversies are ubiquitous in philosophy and the human sciences. For example, it has been suggested that human races, hysteria, intelligence, mental disorder, propositional attitudes such as beliefs and desires, the self, and the super-ego should be eliminated from the list of respectable entities in the human sciences. I argue that eliminativist proposals are often presented in the framework of an oversimplified ""phlogiston model"" and suggest an alternative account that describes ontological elimination on a gradual scale between criticism of empirical assumptions and conceptual choices."
24275075,Distinct effects of duration of untreated psychosis on brain cortical activities in different treatment phases of schizophrenia: a multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy study,Po-Han Chou,"Background: Duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) has been shown to be associated with both poor short-term and long-term outcomes in schizophrenia. Even so, few studies have used functional neuroimaging to investigate DUP in schizophrenia. In the present study, we used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to investigate the influence of DUP on brain functions during a verbal fluency test (VFT) in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: A total of 62 patients with schizophrenia were included. They were categorized into either short treatment (≤6months, n=33) or long treatment (>6months, n=29) groups based on their duration of treatment. Hemodynamic changes over the frontotemporal regions during a VFT were measured using multi-channel NIRS. We examined the associations between DUP and hemodynamic changes in each group to explore if there were different effects of DUP on brain cortical activity at different treatment durations. Results: In the long treatment group, we found significant associations between a longer DUP and decreased cortical activity approximately at the left inferior frontal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right precentral gyrus, bilateral superior temporal gyrus, and bilateral middle temporal gyrus, whereas no associations between DUP and brain cortical activity were observed in the short treatment group. Conclusions: Our results indicated that longer DUP may be associated with decreased level of cortical activities over the frontotemporal regions in the long-term. Early detection and intervention of psychosis that shortens DUP might help to improve the long-term outcomes in patients with schizophrenia."
24275020,Understanding the gap between cognitive abilities and daily living skills in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders with average intelligence,Amie W Duncan,"Daily living skills standard scores on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-2nd edition were examined in 417 adolescents from the Simons Simplex Collection. All participants had at least average intelligence and a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regressions were used to examine the prevalence and predictors of a ""daily living skills deficit,"" defined as below average daily living skills in the context of average intelligence quotient. Approximately half of the adolescents were identified as having a daily living skills deficit. Autism symptomatology, intelligence quotient, maternal education, age, and sex accounted for only 10% of the variance in predicting a daily living skills deficit. Identifying factors associated with better or worse daily living skills may help shed light on the variability in adult outcome in individuals with autism spectrum disorder with average intelligence."
24273536,Are Myxobacteria intelligent?,Dale Kaiser,"""Intelligence"" is understood in different ways. Because humans are proud of their ability to speak, intelligence often includes the ability to communicate with others, to plan for the future, and to solve frequently encountered problems. Myxobacteria are among the most socially adept and ubiquitous of bacteria that live in the soil. To survive in nature, Myxobacteria communicate with their peers, using signals that elicit specific responses. Both swarming-growth and starvation-induced fruiting body development depend upon the specificity and effectiveness of signals passed between cells. Dynamic swarms spread outward, forming regular multi-cellular and multi-layered structures as they spread. Several different extra-cellular signals have been identified for fruiting body development and one is hypothesized for swarm development. Some extra-cellular signals are small, diffusible molecules. Others are protein molecules. The swarm signal appears to consist of structurally complex, protein to protein, contact junctions between pairs of side by side aligned cells. Each junction persists for less than a minute before disconnecting. After separating, both cells move on to make similar, transient connections with other cells. Eventually, the signal spreads across a prescribed population of communicating cells."
24273503,Exceptional visuospatial imagery in schizophrenia; implications for madness and creativity,Taylor L Benson,"Biographical and historical accounts suggest a link between scientific creativity and schizophrenia. Longitudinal studies of gifted children indicate that visuospatial imagery plays a pivotal role in exceptional achievements in science and mathematics. We asked whether visuospatial imagery is enhanced in individuals with schizophrenia (SZ). We compared SZ and matched healthy controls (HC) on five visuospatial tasks tapping parietal and frontoparietal functions. Two aspects of visuospatial transformation, spatial location and mental imagery manipulation were examined with Paper Folding Test (PFT) and jigsaw puzzle task (JPT), respectively. Visuospatial intelligence was assessed with Ravens Progressive Matrices, which is associated with frontoparietal network activity. Hemispatial inattention implicating parietal function was assessed with line bisection (LB) task. Mediated by prefrontal cortex, spatial delayed response task (DRT) was used to index working memory maintenance, which was impaired in SZ compared to HC. In contrast, SZ showed intact visuospatial intelligence and transformation of location. Further, SZ performed significantly better than HC on JPT indicating enhanced mental imagery manipulation. Spatial working memory (SWM) maintenance and mental imagery manipulation were strongly associated in HC but dissociated in SZ. Thus, we observed enhanced mental imagery manipulation in SZ but the dissociation of mental imagery from working memory suggests a disrupted frontoparietal network. Finally, while HC showed the expected leftward pseudoneglect, SZ showed increased rightward LB bias implicating left hemispatial inattention and impaired right parietal control of spatial attention. The current results chart a unique profile of impaired, spared and enhanced parietal-mediated visuospatial functions implicating parietal abnormalities as a biobehavioral marker for SZ. We discuss these results in relation to creative cognition."
24273408,Brain volumes and neuropsychological performance are related to current smoking and alcoholism history,Riya B Luhar,"Background: Dual dependence on alcohol and nicotine is common, with many reports suggesting that more than 80% of alcoholics also smoke cigarettes. Even after cessation of alcohol consumption, many recovering alcoholics continue to smoke. In this exploratory study, we examined how current smoking and a history of alcoholism interacted in relation to brain volumes and neuropsychological performance. Methods: Participants were 14 abstinent long-term alcoholics (seven current smokers and seven nonsmokers), and 13 nonalcoholics (six current smokers and seven nonsmokers). The groups were equivalent in age, gender, education, and intelligence quotient. Two multiecho magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MP-RAGE) scans were collected for all participants using a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scanner with a 32 channel head coil. Brain volumes for each gray and white matter region of interest were derived using FreeSurfer. Participants completed a battery of neuropsychological tests measuring intelligence quotient, memory, executive functions, personality variables, and affect. Results: COMPARED TO NONSMOKING NONALCOHOLICS, ALCOHOLICS WHO SMOKE (THE COMORBID GROUP) HAD VOLUMETRIC ABNORMALITIES IN: pre- and para-central frontal cortical areas and rostral middle frontal white matter; parahippocampal and temporal pole regions; the amygdala; the pallidum; the ventral diencephalic region; and the lateral ventricle. The comorbid group performed worse than nonsmoking nonalcoholics on tests of executive functioning and on visually-based memory tests. History of alcoholism was associated with higher neuroticism scores among smokers, and current smoking was associated with higher sensation seeking scores and lower extraversion scores among nonalcoholics. Conclusion: Results from this exploratory study support and extend prior reports showing that alcoholism and smoking, alone and in combination, are associated with structural brain abnormalities and poorer performance on neuropsychological tests. Therefore, it is important to consider smoking status in alcoholism studies and vice versa."
24273359,An Increase of Intelligence in China 1986-2012,Jianghong Liu,"The Flynn effect has been widely researched in Western and European nations, while it has been comparatively understudied in Asian countries. This study examines possible Flynn effects in China from 1985-86 and to 2011-12. Results are reported for an IQ increase among 12 year olds on the Full Scale IQ WISC-R (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children- Revised) of 6.19 IQ points, a gain on the Performance IQ of 6.55 IQ points, and a gain on the Verbal IQ of 1.91 IQ points."
24273089,"Using classification and regression trees, liquid-based cytology and nuclear morphometry for the discrimination of endometrial lesions",Abraham Pouliakis,"'The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of classification and regression trees (CARTs) in discriminating benign from malignant endometrial nuclei and lesions. The study was performed on 222 histologically confirmed liquid based cytological smears, specifically: 117 benign cases, 62 malignant cases and 43 hyperplasias with or without atypia. About 100 nuclei were measured from each case using an image analysis system; in total, we collected 22783 nuclei. The nuclei from 50% of the cases (the training set) were used to construct a CART model that was used for knowledge extraction. The nuclei from the remaining 50% of cases (test set) were used to evaluate the stability and performance of the CART on unknown data. Based on the results of the CART for nuclei classification, we propose two classification methods to discriminate benign from malignant cases. The CART model had an overall accuracy for the classification of endometrial nuclei equal to 85%, specificity 90.68%, and sensitivity 72.05%. Both methods for case classification had similar performance: overall accuracy in the range 94-95%, specificity 95%, and sensitivity 91-94%. The results of the proposed system outperform the standard cytological diagnosis of endometrial lesions. This study highlights interesting diagnostic features of endometrial nuclear morphology and provides a new classification approach for endometrial nuclei and cases. The proposed method can be a useful tool for the everyday practice of the cytological laboratory."
24269298,Longitudinal processing speed impairments in males with autism and the effects of white matter microstructure,Brittany G Travers,"The present study used an accelerated longitudinal design to examine group differences and age-related changes in processing speed in 81 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to 56 age-matched individuals with typical development (ages 6-39 years). Processing speed was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-3rd edition (WISC-III) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-3rd edition (WAIS-III). Follow-up analyses examined processing speed subtest performance and relations between processing speed and white matter microstructure (as measured with diffusion tensor imaging [DTI] in a subset of these participants). After controlling for full scale IQ, the present results show that processing speed index standard scores were on average 12 points lower in the group with ASD compared to the group with typical development. There were, however, no significant group differences in standard score age-related changes within this age range. For subtest raw scores, the group with ASD demonstrated robustly slower processing speeds in the adult versions of the IQ test (i.e., WAIS-III) but not in the child versions (WISC-III), even though age-related changes were similar in both the ASD and typically developing groups. This pattern of results may reflect difficulties that become increasingly evident in ASD on more complex measures of processing speed. Finally, DTI measures of whole-brain white matter microstructure suggested that fractional anisotropy (but not mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, or axial diffusivity) made significant but small-sized contributions to processing speed standard scores across our entire sample. Taken together, the present findings suggest that robust decreases in processing speed may be present in ASD, more pronounced in adulthood, and partially attributable to white matter microstructural integrity."
24269297,Association of basal forebrain volumes and cognition in normal aging,D Wolf,"The basal forebrain cholinergic system (BFCS) is known to undergo moderate neurodegenerative alterations during normal aging and severe atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been suggested that functional and structural alterations of the BFCS mediate cognitive performance in normal aging and AD. But, it is still unclear to what extend age-associated cognitive decline can be related to BFCS in normal aging. We analyzed the relationship between BFCS volume and cognition using MRI and a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery in a cohort of 43 healthy elderly subjects spanning the age range from 60 to 85 years. Most notably, we found significant associations between general intelligence and BFCS volumes, specifically within areas corresponding to posterior nuclei of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (Ch4p) and the nucleus subputaminalis (NSP). Associations between specific cognitive domains and BFCS volumes were less pronounced. Supplementary analyses demonstrated that especially the volume of NSP but also the volume of Ch4p was related to the volume of widespread temporal, frontal, and parietal gray and white matter regions. Volumes of these gray and white matter regions were also related to general intelligence. Higher volumes of Ch4p and NSP may enhance the effectiveness of acetylcholine supply in related gray and white matter regions underlying general intelligence and hence explain the observed association between the volume of Ch4p as well as NSP and general intelligence. Since general intelligence is known to attenuate the degree of age-associated cognitive decline and the risk of developing late-onset AD, the BFCS might, besides the specific contribution to the pathophysiology in AD, constitute a mechanism of brain resilience in normal aging."
24267436,Urbanization and international trade and investment policies as determinants of noncommunicable diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa,Ashley Schram,"There are three dominant globalization pathways affecting noncommunicable diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA): urbanization, trade liberalization, and investment liberalization. Urbanization carries potential health benefits due to improved access to an increased variety of food imports, although for the growing number of urban poor, this has often meant increased reliance on cheap, highly processed food commodities. Reduced barriers to trade have eased the importation of such commodities, while investment liberalization has increased corporate consolidation over global and domestic food chains. Higher profit margins on processed foods have promoted the creation of 'obesogenic' environments, which through progressively integrated global food systems have been increasingly 'exported' to developing nations. This article explores globalization processes, the food environment, and dietary health outcomes in SSA through the use of trend analyses and structural equation modelling. The findings are considered in the context of global barriers and facilitators for healthy public policy."
24267233,IQ in childhood and atherosclerosis in middle-age: 40 Year follow-up of the Newcastle Thousand Families Cohort Study,Beverly A Roberts,"Objective: Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) is a known precursor to coronary heart disease (CHD) and other relevant health outcomes such as stroke and cognitive impairment. In addition, higher childhood intelligence has been associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease events in later life, although the mechanisms of effect are unclear. We therefore examined the association between childhood intelligence and atherosclerosis using carotid IMT as a marker of the atherosclerotic process. Approach: Participants were 412 members of the Newcastle Thousand Families Study, a prospective cohort study of all 1142 births in the city of Newcastle in May and June 1947, who took an IQ test and English and arithmetic tests at age 11 years. Study members participated in a medical examination and lifestyle assessment at age 49-51 years during which IMT was measured using ultrasound techniques. Results: Individuals with higher childhood IQ score had a lower mean IMT in middle-age. A standard deviation higher score in childhood overall IQ was associated with a 0.053 mm (95% CI -0.102, -0.004) lower IMT in men and a 0.039 mm (95% CI -0.080, -0.002) lower IMT in women. Similar levels of association were found for the English and arithmetic tests. After adjustment for a range of covariates including education, the size of effect was undiminished in men but increased in women. Conclusions: In the present study, higher childhood IQ scores were associated with a lower degree of atherosclerosis by middle-age."
24266398,Performance on the dimensional change card sort and backward digit span by young children with autism without intellectual disability,Susan Faja,"The early development of executive function (EF) and its relation to autism symptom expression is of considerable theoretical interest, particularly in children without general cognitive delay. Executive function was tested in 23 children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) without intellectual disability and 20 age- and IQ-matched typically developing children. Even though performance was equivalent between the two groups on tests of general intelligence, flexibility in card sorting was lower for children with ASD. Verbal working memory during the backward digit span did not differ between groups. Among children with ASD, poorer performance on card sorting distinguished a subgroup with worse social-communication functioning above and beyond IQ. Controlling for IQ social and repetitive symptoms of ASD did not differ based on card sorting ability."
24266052,KCNJ11 in-frame 15-bp deletion leading to glibenclamide-responsive neonatal diabetes mellitus in a Chinese child,Wenli Yang,"The ATP-sensitive K+ channel controls insulin secretion from the islet. Mutations in KCNJ11 can cause permanent and transient neonatal diabetes. To date, more than 30 KCNJ11 mutations have been revealed as related to the onset of neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), most of which are responsive to glibenclamide treatment. In the present study, we sequenced the KCNJ11 gene in a Chinese girl diagnosed with NDM and in her parents. An in-frame 15-bp KCNJ11 deletion was identified in the patient, whereas no KCNJ11 deletions were found in her parents, indicating that this deletion was de novo. The patient was responsive to the treatment of glibenclamide. Ten months of follow-up showed that, besides permanent NDM, the motor and intelligence development of the girl was normal and she suffered no onset of convulsions. The result, to some degree, improved our knowledge on NDM."
24265700,Impact of chemotherapy for childhood leukemia on brain morphology and function,Marina Genschaft,"Objective: Using multidisciplinary treatment modalities the majority of children with cancer can be cured but we are increasingly faced with therapy-related toxicities. We studied brain morphology and neurocognitive functions in adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood acute, low and standard risk lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which was successfully treated with chemotherapy. We expected that intravenous and intrathecal chemotherapy administered in childhood will affect grey matter structures, including hippocampus and olfactory bulbs, areas where postnatal neurogenesis is ongoing. Methods: We examined 27 ALL-survivors and 27 age-matched healthy controls, ages 15-22 years. ALL-survivors developed disease prior to their 11th birthday without central nervous system involvement, were treated with intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy and received no radiation. Volumes of grey, white matter and olfactory bulbs were measured on T1 and T2 magnetic resonance images manually, using FIRST (FMRIB's integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Memory, executive functions, attention, intelligence and olfaction were assessed. Results: Mean volumes of left hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and nucleus accumbens were smaller in the ALL group. VBM analysis revealed significantly smaller volumes of the left calcarine gyrus, both lingual gyri and the left precuneus. DTI data analysis provided no evidence for white matter pathology. Lower scores in hippocampus-dependent memory were measured in ALL-subjects, while lower figural memory correlated with smaller hippocampal volumes. Interpretation: Findings demonstrate that childhood ALL, treated with chemotherapy, is associated with smaller grey matter volumes of neocortical and subcortical grey matter and lower hippocampal memory performance in adolescence and adulthood."
24265581,Association between loss of dp140 and cognitive impairment in duchenne and becker dystrophies,T Chamova,"The presence of variable degrees of non progressive cognitive impairment is recognized as a clinical feature of patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies (DMD and BMD), but its pathogenesis still remains a matter of debate. A number of findings have proved that rearrangements located in the second part of the dystrophin ( DMD ) gene seem to be preferentially associated with cognitive impairment. Dp140 is a distal dystrophin isoform, mainly expressed during fetal brain development, whose role for neuropsychological functioning was suggested. The aims of the current study were to explore the possible association between cognitive impairment and DNA mutations affecting the regulatory regions of Dp140, as well as to compare the neuropsychological functioning of patients affected with DMD and Intermediate muscular dystrophy (IMD) with those affected by Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Fiftythree patients genetically diagnosed with DMD, IMD and BMD, subdivided according to sites of mutations along the DMD gene, underwent a neuropsychological assessment, evaluating their general cognitive abilities, verbal memory, attention and executive functions. Twenty patients with mutations, terminating in exon 44 or starting at exon 45 were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of microsatellites STR44, SK12, SK21 and P20 DXS269, in order to evaluate the integrity of the Dp140 promoter region. According to our statistical results, there was not a significant difference in terms of general intelligence between the allelic forms of the disease, a higher frequency of mental retardation was observed in DMD patients. The patients with BMD had better results on tests, measuring long-term verbal learning memory and executive functions. We found that patients lacking Dp140 performed more poorly on all neuropsychological tests compared to those with preserved Dp140. Overall, our findings suggest that the loss of Dp140 is associated with a higher risk of intellectual impairment among patients with dystrophinopathies and highlights the possible role of this distal isoform in normal cognitive development."
24265146,Neuropsychology of perpetrators of domestic violence: the role of traumatic brain injury and alcohol abuse and/or dependence,Ángel Romero-Martínez,"Introduction: Neuropsychological impairments of the executive functions, memory, attention, intelligence quotient, and empathy have been found in perpetrators of domestic violence (intimate partner violence). These impairments could be partially explained by alcohol abuse, dependence, or traumatic brain injuries. Aims: This study reviews the neuropsychological deficits of perpetrators of intimate partner violence. At the same it seeks to integrate and relate these main points with their neuroanatomical correlates. We have also established the relationship between alcohol abuse, dependence, brain damage (including traumatic brain injuries) and those deficits. Development: Scientific literature has been reviewed by means of Google Scholar, PsycINFO, PubMed, Medline and ISI Web of Knowledge. Conclusions: Perpetrators of domestic violence present high mental rigidity, as well as low levels of inhibition, processing speed, verbal and attention skills, and abstract reasoning. Additionally, perpetrators show working and long play memory impairments. Moreover, those deficits could be impaired by traumatic brain injuries and alcohol abuse and/or dependence. Nonetheless, these both variables are not enough to explain the deficits. Functional abnormalities on the prefrontal and occipital cortex, fusiform gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, thalamus and amygdala could be associated with these impairments. An analysis of these mechanisms may assist in the development of neuropsychological rehabilitation programmes that could help improve current therapies."
24262122,Autobiographical memory and its association with neuropsychological function in bipolar disorder,Woo Jung Kim,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the overgeneralization of autobiographical memory (AM) in bipolar disorder (BD) and assess its association with multiple cognitive domains. Method: Twenty-eight clinically stable bipolar I patients and an equal number of age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) were included. All participants were examined using the autobiographical memory test (AMT) and the neuropsychological battery including the general intelligence, attention, verbal memory, verbal fluency, visual memory, and executive functions domain. Demographic, clinical, and test variables were compared between BD and HC groups. Correlation analyses of AMT scores with cognitive functions were performed within each group, controlling for demographic and clinical variables. Results: Total and negative scores of AMT were significantly lower in BD patients compared to HC individuals. AMT scores were significantly correlated with WAIS similarities, WCST perseverative errors, and WCST categories completed in BD, whereas AMT scores were correlated with verbal memory and verbal fluency in HC. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that overgeneral AM is a characteristic of BD and is related to executive function. Future studies should investigate the benefit of additional treatment focusing on overgeneral AM in BD."
24257227,Normative data for the Stroop color word test for a North American population,Sarah A Morrow,"Background: Cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) often involves attentional deficits. The Stroop colour word test, a measure of attention, lacks current normative data for an english-speaking North american MS population. Further some authors suggest the Stroop actually measures processing speed. Objective: To generate normative data for the Stroop colour word test that can be used for a Canadian or North american MS population and to examine the relationship between processing speed tests--the Paced auditory Serial addition Test (PASAT) and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)--and the Stroop. Results: Data from 146 healthy subjects aged 18-56 was collected. age was significantly although weakly correlated with general intelligence (r=0.168, p=0.043) assessed with the North american adult Reading Test (NAART), and education (r=-0.313, p<0.001). No demographic variables were associated with SDMT or PASAT. age had a low-moderate negative correlation (r=-0.403, p<0.001) with Stroop scores. The mean (±standard deviation, SD) Stroop score was 45.4(10.4). The z-score can thus be calculated as [(X-45.4)/10.4]. if adjusted for age, Xadj = [X-(-0.47)(age-37.5)] and is substituted for X. in a comparison MS population consisting of 75 randomly selected patients from the MS Cognitive clinic, Stroop and PASAT performance were not related. a relationship existed between Stroop and SDMT scores but only 12.2% of the Stroop score variance was explained by the SDMT. Therefore, the Stroop measures selective attention independently of processing speed. Conclusion: This data can be used to determine impaired attention in MS patients.

24256892,The impact of television viewing on brain structures: cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses,Hikaru Takeuchi,"Television (TV) viewing is known to affect children's verbal abilities and other physical, cognitive, and emotional development in psychological studies. However, the brain structural development associated with TV viewing has never been investigated. Here we examined cross-sectional correlations between the duration of TV viewing and regional gray/white matter volume (rGMV/rWMV) among 133 boys and 143 girls as well as correlations between the duration of TV viewing and longitudinal changes that occurred a few years later among 111 boys and 105 girls. After correcting for confounding factors, we found positive effects of TV viewing on rGMV of the frontopolar and medial prefrontal areas in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, positive effects of TV viewing on rGMV/rWMV of areas of the visual cortex in cross-sectional analyses, and positive effects of TV viewing on rGMV of the hypothalamus/septum and sensorimotor areas in longitudinal analyses. We also confirmed negative effects of TV viewing on verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. These anatomical correlates may be linked to previously known effects of TV viewing on verbal competence, aggression, and physical activity. In particular, the present results showed effects of TV viewing on the frontopolar area of the brain, which has been associated with intellectual abilities."
24254803,Arsenic contamination in groundwater and its effects on adolescent intelligence and social competence in Bangladesh with special reference to daily drinking/cooking water intake,Mst Nasrin Nahar,"Objective: The present study aims to investigate the relationship between arsenic (As) exposure and intelligence quotient (IQ) or social competence (SC) of Bangladeshi adolescents (aged 14 or 15 years) in Sonargaon thana. Methods: Information about socioeconomic status (SES) was collected as confounding factors. To evaluate the relative contribution of As sources to total As intake, the As concentrations in urine and drinking/cooking water, and the amount of water added in cooking, were assessed on site using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Results: The results confirmed that As exposure was essential to lower adolescent IQ or SC because they were negatively associated with As exposure after controlling for SES (particularly household income). Except for cooking water, the amount of drinking water varied with season and appeared to be the major As source because the As concentration in water was generally correlated with the As concentration in urine, and they were related to lower IQ or SC (even after controlling for SES). The FFQ survey revealed that rice was consumed the most frequently (more than once daily), followed by daal (bean) soup and nonleafy vegetables, but fish, meat, and eggs were consumed approximately once a week. Water intake per meal from cooked rice was estimated to be 616 mL/person, followed by bean soup (258 mL/person) and cooked vegetables (82 mL/person). Conclusions: Our results suggest that water used for cooking might be an important source of As, and the cooking process can affect the amount of As in cooked food."
24250828,"Personality traits, education, physical exercise, and childhood neurological function as independent predictors of adult obesity",Helen Cheng,"Objective: To investigate whether personality traits, education, physical exercise, parental socio-economic conditions, and childhood neurological function are independently associated with obesity in 50 year old adults in a longitudinal birth cohort study. Method: The sample consisted of 5,921 participants born in Great Britain in 1958 and followed up at 7, 11, 33, 42, and 50 years with data on body mass index measured at 42 and 50 years. Results: There was an increase of adult obesity from 14.2% at age 42 to 23.6% at 50 years. Cohort members who were reported by teachers on overall clumsiness as ""certainly applied"" at age 7 were more likely to become obese at age 50. In addition, educational qualifications, traits Conscientiousness and Extraversion, psychological distress, and physical exercise were all significantly associated with adult obesity. The associations remained to be significant after controlling for birth weight and gestation, maternal and paternal BMI, childhood BMI, childhood intelligence and behavioural adjustment, as well as diet. Conclusion: Neurological function in childhood, education, trait Conscientiousness, and exercise were all significantly and independently associated with adult obesity, each explained unique individual variability."
24247912,"Relationship between polysomnographic sleep architecture and behavior in medication-free children with TS, ADHD, TS and ADHD, and controls",Robyn J Stephens,"Objective: To describe the relationship between sleep architecture and behavioral measures in unmedicated children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome (TS), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), TS and comorbid ADHD (TS + ADHD), and healthy controls. The study also set out to examine differences in sleep architecture with each diagnosis. Method: A cross-sectional, 2-night consecutive polysomnographic sleep study was conducted in 90 children. All participants were matched for age, gender, and level of intelligence. Results: Scores on the Child Behavior Checklist delinquency measure were modestly but significantly correlated with the number of movements during REM sleep (r = .36, p = .003). Significant correlations were also noted among the number of total arousals and arousals from slow wave sleep (SWS), and scores on the measures of conduct disorder, hyperactivity/immaturity, and restless/disorganized behaviors. There were a few significant differences in sleep architecture among the diagnostic groups. The ADHD-only group exhibited a significantly higher number of total arousals (p < .01) and arousals from SWS (p < .01) compared with the other three study groups. Discussion: Our findings indicate that children with TS and/or ADHD and who have more arousals from sleep are significantly more likely to have issues with conduct disorder, hyperactivity/immaturity, and restless/disorganized behavior. It was also noted that having ADHD, alone or comorbid with TS, is associated with a significantly greater number of movements during both non-REM and REM sleep. This study underscores the compelling need for the diagnosis and treatment of any sleep disorders in children with TS and/or ADHD so as to facilitate better management of problem behaviors."
24246094,Determinants of academic performance in children with sickle cell anaemia,Osita U Ezenwosu,"Background: Some factors are known to influence the academic performance of children with Sickle Cell Anaemia (SCA). Information on their effects in these children is limited in Nigeria. The factors which influence academic performance of children with SCA in Enugu, Nigeria are determined in this study. Methods: Consecutive children with SCA aged 5-11 years were recruited at the weekly sickle cell clinic of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH) Enugu, Nigeria. Their age- and sex- matched normal classmates were recruited as controls. The total number of days of school absence for 2009/2010 academic session was obtained for each pair of pupils from the class attendance register. Academic performance was assessed using the average of the overall scores in the three term examinations of same session. Intelligence ability was determined with Draw-A-Person Quotient (DAPQ) using the Draw-A-Person Test while socio-economic status was determined using the occupational status and educational attainment of each parent. Results: Academic performance of children with SCA showed statistically significant association with their socio-economic status (χ2 = 9.626, p = 0.047), and significant correlation with DAPQ (r = 0.394, p = 0.000) and age (r = -0.412, p = 0.000). However, no significant relationship existed between academic performance and school absence in children with SCA (r = -0.080, p = 0.453). Conclusions: Academic performance of children with SCA is influenced by their intelligence ability, age and socio-economic status but not negatively affected by their increased school absenteeism."
24239987,Hybrid fault diagnosis of nonlinear systems using neural parameter estimators,E Sobhani-Tehrani,"This paper presents a novel integrated hybrid approach for fault diagnosis (FD) of nonlinear systems taking advantage of both the system's mathematical model and the adaptive nonlinear approximation capability of computational intelligence techniques. Unlike most FD techniques, the proposed solution simultaneously accomplishes fault detection, isolation, and identification (FDII) within a unified diagnostic module. At the core of this solution is a bank of adaptive neural parameter estimators (NPEs) associated with a set of single-parameter fault models. The NPEs continuously estimate unknown fault parameters (FPs) that are indicators of faults in the system. Two NPE structures, series-parallel and parallel, are developed with their exclusive set of desirable attributes. The parallel scheme is extremely robust to measurement noise and possesses a simpler, yet more solid, fault isolation logic. In contrast, the series-parallel scheme displays short FD delays and is robust to closed-loop system transients due to changes in control commands. Finally, a fault tolerant observer (FTO) is designed to extend the capability of the two NPEs that originally assumes full state measurements for systems that have only partial state measurements. The proposed FTO is a neural state estimator that can estimate unmeasured states even in the presence of faults. The estimated and the measured states then comprise the inputs to the two proposed FDII schemes. Simulation results for FDII of reaction wheels of a three-axis stabilized satellite in the presence of disturbances and noise demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FDII solutions under partial state measurements."
24239224,Classification of stilbenoid compounds by entropy of artificial intelligence,Gloria Castellano,"A set of 66 stilbenoid compounds is classified into a system of periodic properties by using a procedure based on artificial intelligence, information entropy theory. Eight characteristics in hierarchical order are used to classify structurally the stilbenoids. The former five features mark the group or column while the latter three are used to indicate the row or period in the table of periodic classification. Those stilbenoids in the same group are suggested to present similar properties. Furthermore, compounds also in the same period will show maximum resemblance. In this report, the stilbenoids in the table are related to experimental data of bioactivity and antioxidant properties available in the technical literature. It should be noted that stilbenoids with glycoxyl groups esterified with benzoic acid derivatives, in the group g11000 in the extreme right of the periodic table, show the greatest antioxidant activity as confirmed by experiments in the bibliography. Moreover, the second group from the right (g10111) contains E-piceatannol, which antioxidant activity is recognized in the literature. The experiments confirm our results of the periodic classification."
24238861,Impaired cognitive functioning in patients with tyrosinemia type I receiving nitisinone,Fatiha Bendadi,"Objective: To examine cognitive functioning in patients with tyrosinemia type I treated with nitisinone and a protein-restricted diet. Study design: We performed a cross-sectional study to establish cognitive functioning in children with tyrosinemia type I compared with their unaffected siblings. Intelligence was measured using age-appropriate Wechsler Scales. To assess cognitive development over time, we retrieved sequential IQ scores in a single-center subset of patients. We also evaluated whether plasma phenylalanine and tyrosine levels during treatment was correlated with cognitive development. Results: Average total IQ score in 10 patients with tyrosinemia type I receiving nitisinone was significantly lower compared with their unaffected siblings (71 ± 13 vs 91 ± 13; P = .008). Both verbal and performance IQ subscores differed (77 ± 14 vs 95 ± 11; P < .05 and 70 ± 11 vs 87 ± 15; P < .05, respectively). Repeated IQ measurements in a single-center subset of 5 patients revealed a decline in average IQ score over time, from 96 ± 15 to 69 ± 11 (P < .001). No significant association was found between IQ score and either plasma tyrosine or phenylalanine concentration. Conclusion: Patients with tyrosinemia type I treated with nitisinone are at risk for impaired cognitive function despite a protein-restricted diet."
24238638,Coding warnings without interfering with dismounted soldiers' missions,Tal Oron-Gilad,"Objectives: Warnings are an effective way to communicate hazard, yet they can also increase task demand when presented to operators involved in real-world tasks. Furthermore, in military-related tasks warnings are often given in codes to avoid counter-intelligence, which may foster additional working memory load. Background: Adherence to warnings in the military domain is crucial to promote safety and reduce accidents and injuries. The empirical question arises as to how aspects of coding the warning may interfere with the primary task the individual is currently performing and vice versa. Method: Six experimental conditions were designed to assess how warning-code storage format, response format, and increasing working memory demand (retention) affected both performance on the primary task and the rate of compliance to warnings, considered here as the secondary task. Results: Results revealed that the combination of warning-code storage and response format affected compliance rate and the highest compliance occurred when warnings were presented as pictorials and responses were coded verbally. Contrary to the proposed hypotheses, warning storage format did not affect performance on the primary task, which was only affected by the level of working memory demand. Thus, the intra-modal warning storages did not interfere with the visual/spatial nature of the primary operational task. However, increase in working memory demand, by increasing the number of memorized warning codes, had an effect on both compliance rate and primary task performance. Conclusions: Rather than warning code storage alone, it is the coupling of warning storage and response format that has the most significant effect on compliance."
24238519,Eye-movement study during visual search in Chinese children with developmental dyslexia,Xiu-Hong Li,"Background: Developmental dyslexia (DD) is a disorder in which children with normal intelligence and sensory abilities show learning deficits in reading. Abnormal eye movements have been found in DD. However, eye-movement abnormalities during visual search among Chinese children with DD remain unknown. We aimed to identify the eyemovement characteristics and search efficiency of Chinese children with DD during visual search for targets of different conceptual categories, under same-category conditions. Methods: We compared 32 Chinese dyslexic children and 39 non-dyslexic children in visual search tasks, which were assessed using EyeLink II High-Speed Eye Tracker (SR Research Ltd., Canada). Letters, single Chinese characters, digits, Chinese phrases, figures and facial expressions were used as stimuli. Targets were similar to distractors in meaning, phonology and/or shape. Results: A main effect of task on visual search scores and all eye-movement parameters were found. Search scores, average saccade amplitude and saccade distance were significantly smaller in the DD group than in the controls. An interaction between group and task was found for pupil diameter. Conclusions: Unlike normal readers, children with DD had a reduction in the visual attention span and search accuracy. Besides, children with DD could not increase their mental workload with increase in task difficulty. The conceptual category of the stimulus materials significantly impacts search speed, accuracy and eye-movement parameters."
24238393,Good cognitive performances in a child with Prader-Willi syndrome,Rosa Nugnes,"We report the case of a child affected by Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) with good cognitive performances and without relevant behavioral abnormalities.The diagnosis of PWS, suspected on the basis of clinical features and past history, was confirmed by DNA methylation analysis. Additional genetic testing revealed a maternal uniparental disomy. Intellectual profile was analyzed by WISC-III and Raven's Progressive Matrices CPM, while the behavior was evaluated by K-SADS-PL and Child Behavior Checklist/4-18 to the parents.WISC-III test showed a Total Intelligence Quotient (T-IQ = 79) at the border level for age. The Verbal Intelligence Quotient (V-IQ) showed a lower score than the Performance Intelligence Quotient (P-IQ) (78 and 85, respectively). Raven's Matrices CPM showed an intelligence level at 75-90° percentile for age. Concerning behavioral evaluation, a difficulty in impulse control was observed, with persistent but controllable search for food, without a clear psychopathological meaning. Also according to K-SADS-PL no areas of psychopathological dimensions were detected. In conclusion, in presence of consisting clinical features of PWS and high diagnostic suspicion, the diagnosis of PWS should be considered even in presence of a borderline IQ and in absence of psychopathological abnormalities."
24236952,A neuropsychological investigation of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System,Ekaterina Keifer,"Despite a strong historical association between frontal lobe lesions and executive dysfunction, questions remain regarding the neuropsychological characterization of specific regions within the prefrontal cortex, as well as the utility of some executive function measures. The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS; Delis, Kaplan, & Kramer, 2001) has gained popularity as a collection of executive function tests, but its sensitivity and specificity for detecting focal frontal lobe dysfunction remain uncertain. The current study investigated performances of patients with focal ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC, n = 13), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, n = 14), and nonfrontal (NF, n = 18) lesions on the entire D-KEFS battery. We also obtained IQ data from conventional measures (the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition and Fourth Edition, WAIS-III/IV). On six D-KEFS indices, patients with dlPFC lesions performed lower than patients with vmPFC and NF lesions. On three other indices, the performances of the dlPFC group were lower than those of the NF group, but did not differ from those of the vmPFC group. However, none of these between-group differences were statistically significant after full-scale IQ and processing speed were controlled for, suggesting that the observed weaknesses in patients with dlPFC lesions were not specific to executive functions. Patients with vmPFC and NF lesions could not be differentiated based on their performances on any D-KEFS measures. While some D-KEFS measures show promise in differentiating patients with dlPFC lesions, the clinical advantage of using the D-KEFS over more traditional measures is not empirically compelling."
24236109,"Predictors of intelligence at the age of 5: family, pregnancy and birth characteristics, postnatal influences, and postnatal growth",Hanne-Lise Falgreen Eriksen,"Parental education and maternal intelligence are well-known predictors of child IQ. However, the literature regarding other factors that may contribute to individual differences in IQ is inconclusive. The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of a number of variables whose predictive status remain unclarified, in a sample of basically healthy children with a low rate of pre- and postnatal complications. 1,782 5-year-old children sampled from the Danish National Birth Cohort (2003-2007) were assessed with a short form of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Revised. Information on parental characteristics, pregnancy and birth factors, postnatal influences, and postnatal growth was collected during pregnancy and at follow-up. A model including study design variables and child's sex explained 7% of the variance in IQ, while parental education and maternal IQ increased the explained variance to 24%. Other predictors were parity, maternal BMI, birth weight, breastfeeding, and the child's head circumference and height at follow-up. These variables, however, only increased the explained variance to 29%. The results suggest that parental education and maternal IQ are major predictors of IQ and should be included routinely in studies of cognitive development. Obstetrical and postnatal factors also predict IQ, but their contribution may be of comparatively limited magnitude."
24236099,"On the relationships between generative encodings, regularity, and learning abilities when evolving plastic artificial neural networks",Paul Tonelli,"A major goal of bio-inspired artificial intelligence is to design artificial neural networks with abilities that resemble those of animal nervous systems. It is commonly believed that two keys for evolving nature-like artificial neural networks are (1) the developmental process that links genes to nervous systems, which enables the evolution of large, regular neural networks, and (2) synaptic plasticity, which allows neural networks to change during their lifetime. So far, these two topics have been mainly studied separately. The present paper shows that they are actually deeply connected. Using a simple operant conditioning task and a classic evolutionary algorithm, we compare three ways to encode plastic neural networks: a direct encoding, a developmental encoding inspired by computational neuroscience models, and a developmental encoding inspired by morphogen gradients (similar to HyperNEAT). Our results suggest that using a developmental encoding could improve the learning abilities of evolved, plastic neural networks. Complementary experiments reveal that this result is likely the consequence of the bias of developmental encodings towards regular structures: (1) in our experimental setup, encodings that tend to produce more regular networks yield networks with better general learning abilities; (2) whatever the encoding is, networks that are the more regular are statistically those that have the best learning abilities."
24236057,Correlates of adult binge drinking: evidence from a British cohort,Helen Cheng,"Objective: To investigate whether parental social class and cognitive ability in childhood, as well as social and psychological factors, particularly personality traits, are independently associated with binge drinking in 50 year old adults assessed in a longitudinal birth cohort study. Method: 17,415 babies born in Great Britain in 1958 and followed up at 11, 33, and 50 years of age. Their binge drinking alcohol abuse at aged 50 was the outcome measure. Results: 6,478 participants with data on parental social class, childhood cognitive ability, educational qualifications at age 33, personality traits, psychological distress, occupational levels, and alcohol consumption (all measured at age 50) were included in the study. Using logistic regression analyses, results showed that parental social class, childhood intelligence, educational qualifications, occupational levels, personality traits (Extraversion and Disagreeableness), as well as psychological distress, were all significantly and independently associated with adult excessive alcohol use. Men tended to binge drink more than women (22% in men and 9.8% in women). Conclusion: Both social and psychological factors influence adult excessive alcohol consumption. Personality traits play a more important role than previously understood. There appears to be a distinction between the frequency and dose level of alcohol consumption."
24236016,Meta-analysis of fluid intelligence tests of children from the Chinese mainland with learning difficulties,Fang Tong,"Objective: To evaluate the differences in fluid intelligence tests between normal children and children with learning difficulties in China. Method: PubMed, MD Consult, and other Chinese Journal Database were searched from their establishment to November 2012. After finding comparative studies of Raven measurements of normal children and children with learning difficulties, full Intelligent Quotation (FIQ) values and the original values of the sub-measurement were extracted. The corresponding effect model was selected based on the results of heterogeneity and parallel sub-group analysis was performed. Results: Twelve documents were included in the meta-analysis, and the studies were all performed in mainland of China. Among these, two studies were performed at child health clinics, the other ten sites were schools and control children were schoolmates or classmates. FIQ was evaluated using a random effects model. WMD was -13.18 (95% CI: -16.50- -9.85). Children with learning difficulties showed significantly lower FIQ scores than controls (P<0.00001); Type of learning difficulty and gender differences were evaluated using a fixed-effects model (I² = 0%). The sites and purposes of the studies evaluated here were taken into account, but the reasons of heterogeneity could not be eliminated; The sum IQ of all the subgroups showed considerable heterogeneity (I² = 76.5%). The sub-measurement score of document A showed moderate heterogeneity among all documents, and AB, B, and E showed considerable heterogeneity, which was used in a random effect model. Individuals with learning difficulties showed heterogeneity as well. There was a moderate delay in the first three items (-0.5 to -0.9), and a much more pronounced delay in the latter three items (-1.4 to -1.6). Conclusion: In the Chinese mainland, the level of fluid intelligence of children with learning difficulties was lower than that of normal children. Delayed development in sub-items of C, D, and E was more obvious."
24235065,"Psychological, cognitive and maternal stress assessment in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia",Marco Carotenuto,"Background: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare disorder due to structure and functional abnormalities of respiratory cilia. There are no reports on the behavioral and psychological aspects of children and adolescents with PCD. This study was undertaken to assess the cognitive and behavioural characteristics, and the parental stress of a population of school-aged children with PCD. Methods: Ten PCD and 34 healthy school-aged children underwent Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III edition, Child Behavior Check-List questionnaire (CBCL), Parenting Stress Index-Short Form tests in order to perform a behavioural and psychological evaluation. Results: PCD children showed significant behavioral and social competent problems in CBCL scale than control children, in particular with regard to internalizing problems score (P<0.001). Parental distress, parent-child interaction and total stress in the mothers of PCD patients were higher than those in the controls' parents (P<0.001). Conclusion: Our findings pinpoint the importance of specific psychological support in the clinical management of children with PCD."
24232067,Do audiologic characteristics predict outcomes in children with unilateral hearing loss?,Judith E C Lieu,"Objective: To determine whether audiologic characteristics of unilateral hearing loss in children were associated with language, cognitive, or achievement scores. Study design: Case-control study Setting: Pediatric otolaryngology ambulatory practice Patients: Cases (n = 109) were children aged 6 to 12 years with permanent unilateral hearing loss; controls (n = 95) were siblings with normal bilateral hearing. Interventions: Audiologic characteristics measured included side and severity of hearing loss and word recognition scores in quiet and in noise. Main outcome measures: Cognitive abilities were measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; reading, math, and writing achievement was measured with the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test - Second Edition - Abbreviated; and oral language skills were measured with the Oral Written and Language Scales. Results: Children with unilateral hearing loss had worse verbal cognitive and oral language scores than children with normal hearing, but there were no differences in achievement scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse cognitive scores and had significantly lower oral language scores. Higher word recognition scores of the normal hearing ear in quiet were associated with higher cognitive, oral language, and reading achievement scores. Higher word recognition scores in noise were slightly correlated with higher oral language scores. Conclusion: As expected, children with unilateral hearing loss had worse language scores than their siblings with normal hearing, with trends toward worse cognitive scores. Children with profound unilateral hearing loss tended to have worse outcomes than children with normal hearing or less severe unilateral loss. However, there were no differences in outcomes between children with right or left unilateral hearing loss."
24231557,Cognitive predictors of cognitive change following bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease,Lidia Yágüez,"The beneficial effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for the motor symptoms in advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) are well established. Early in PD, mild cognitive impairment is present in a proportion of patients. Hence, it can also be present in PD patients considered for DBS. The potential impact of even a modest decline post-surgically is a concern because it could result in impaired cognitive function. Therefore, attempts to determine which pre-operative cognitive measures predict post-operative cognitive change warrant further attention. We report our findings in a cohort of 30 routinely operated non-demented patients who underwent detailed neuropsychological assessments on average 7.1 months before and 9.4 months after STN DBS. We report the individual and group differences pre- and post-DBS. Stepwise regression analysis was used to analyse the best cognitive predictors of post-operative cognitive changes. We describe our data in relation to published normative data. Post-STN DBS, the immediate story recall component of verbal memory was the most affected cognitive function showing a significant decline in its group mean with a large effect size. The best predictors for this change were pre-surgical list learning and Full Scale Intelligence Quotient. These results suggest that non-demented patients, with even mild impairments in both general intellectual functions and list learning, may be at greater risk of decline in other aspects of verbal memory after STN DBS. Pre-existing mild executive dysfunction was not influenced post-operatively. These findings may help selection and consent for STN DBS."
24229333,The Academic Backbone: longitudinal continuities in educational achievement from secondary school and medical school to MRCP(UK) and the specialist register in UK medical students and doctors,I C McManus,"Background: Selection of medical students in the UK is still largely based on prior academic achievement, although doubts have been expressed as to whether performance in earlier life is predictive of outcomes later in medical school or post-graduate education. This study analyses data from five longitudinal studies of UK medical students and doctors from the early 1970s until the early 2000s. Two of the studies used the AH5, a group test of general intelligence (that is, intellectual aptitude). Sex and ethnic differences were also analyzed in light of the changing demographics of medical students over the past decades. Methods: Data from five cohort studies were available: the Westminster Study (began clinical studies from 1975 to 1982), the 1980, 1985, and 1990 cohort studies (entered medical school in 1981, 1986, and 1991), and the University College London Medical School (UCLMS) Cohort Study (entered clinical studies in 2005 and 2006). Different studies had different outcome measures, but most had performance on basic medical sciences and clinical examinations at medical school, performance in Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians (MRCP(UK)) examinations, and being on the General Medical Council Specialist Register. Results: Correlation matrices and path analyses are presented. There were robust correlations across different years at medical school, and medical school performance also predicted MRCP(UK) performance and being on the GMC Specialist Register. A-levels correlated somewhat less with undergraduate and post-graduate performance, but there was restriction of range in entrants. General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE)/O-level results also predicted undergraduate and post-graduate outcomes, but less so than did A-level results, but there may be incremental validity for clinical and post-graduate performance. The AH5 had some significant correlations with outcome, but they were inconsistent. Sex and ethnicity also had predictive effects on measures of educational attainment, undergraduate, and post-graduate performance. Women performed better in assessments but were less likely to be on the Specialist Register. Non-white participants generally underperformed in undergraduate and post-graduate assessments, but were equally likely to be on the Specialist Register. There was a suggestion of smaller ethnicity effects in earlier studies. Conclusions: The existence of the Academic Backbone concept is strongly supported, with attainment at secondary school predicting performance in undergraduate and post-graduate medical assessments, and the effects spanning many years. The Academic Backbone is conceptualized in terms of the development of more sophisticated underlying structures of knowledge ('cognitive capital' and 'medical capital'). The Academic Backbone provides strong support for using measures of educational attainment, particularly A-levels, in student selection."
24228338,Intuition in pediatric care],Valérie Loizeau,"Caregiver intuition acquired through experience can be considered a form of intelligence in action. It is used in both reflection and field learning and can be mobilised as part of any nurse's clinical context. Transferring knowledge to young professionals should therefore include intuition to help them adapt to each care situation, especially in paediatrics."
24225346,"Conflict management styles, emotional intelligence and implicit theories of personality of nursing students: a cross-sectional study",Joanne C Y Chan,"Background: Conflict management is an essential skill that nursing students need to master as conflict is unavoidable in clinical settings. Examining nursing students' conflict management styles and the associating factors can inform nurse educators on how to equip nursing students for effective conflict management. Objectives: This study aimed at examining undergraduate nursing students conflict management styles in managing conflict with their supervisors in clinical placement. The associations of emotional intelligence and implicit theories of personality with conflict management styles were also investigated. Design: This is a cross-sectional quantitative survey. Setting: This study took place at a nursing school at a university in Hong Kong. Participants: 568 undergraduate nursing students participated in the study. Methods: Students completed a questionnaire which consisted of demographics, Measure of Implicit Theories of Personality, The Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale (SEIS) and The Rahim Organizational Conflict Inventory-II (ROCI-II) and received a HKD 20 book coupon as compensation. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, reliability analyses, t-tests, correlational and linear regression analyses. Results: For managing conflict with clinical supervisors, students used obliging and integrating most frequently whereas used dominating least. Emotional intelligence was a significant predictor of all five conflict management styles. The higher the emotional intelligence, the more students used integrating, obliging, compromising and dominating. The lower the emotional intelligence, the more students used avoiding. There was a significant association between implicit theories of personality and compromising. The less malleable students perceived personality to be, the more they used compromising. Conclusions: Emotional intelligence was significantly associated with all five conflict management styles while implicit theories of personality were significantly associated with compromising style only. Efforts of nurse educators to enhance students' conflict management skills and emotional intelligence to face conflicts in clinical settings are discussed."
24225340,Encephalopathy in children with Dravet syndrome is not a pure consequence of epilepsy,Rima Nabbout,"Background: Dravet syndrome (DS) is currently considered as an epileptic encephalopathy, a condition in which epilepsy causes deterioration or developmental delay but preliminary data suggested that cognitive course may worsen independently from epilepsy. Our objective was to prospectively analyze the neuropsychological features in a large cohort of DS patients and its relationships with epilepsy and SCN1A mutation. Methods: 81 examinations were performed in 67 patients with typical DS (9m-24y, 15 longitudinally studied) using Brunet-Lezine (developmental/intelligence quotient [DQ/IQ] and DQ sub-scores), Achenbach, Conners, and a semi-quantitative psychomotor score (SQPS). We studied the correlation between DQ/IQ/SQPS and age, epilepsy characteristics, and whether patients presented SCN1A mutation. Results: DQ/IQ significantly decreased with age (r = -.53, p < .001), from normal before 2y (mean 80, range 64-105) to low after 3y (mean 48, range 30-69), with hyperactivity and attention disorders hampering learning abilities especially up to 6y. However, raw (not age-adjusted) DQ sub-scores increased with age during the first decade, showing that there is no regression. We did not find any significant correlation between DQ/IQ at last evaluation and epilepsy data, i.e. first seizure (age, type, duration, fever), seizures during the course (type, fever sensitivity), status epilepticus (age of onset, number, fever), photosensitivity, and treatment, except for myoclonus and focal seizures which were associated with a lower QD/IQ after 3y. SCN1A mutated patients (n = 58) seemed to exhibit worse psychomotor course than non-mutated ones (n = 9) (severe SQPS in 26% vs 0%), although their epilepsy tended to be less severe (tonic seizures in 12% vs 44% [p = 0.04], first status epilepticus before 6 m in 26% vs 67% [p = .02], mean number of SE 2.5 vs 4.5 [p = .09]). DQ sub-scores were dissociated throughout the whole course: from onset hand-eye coordination was significantly lower than language, posture and sociability (p < .01). Dissociation seemed to be more frequent in mutated than in non-mutated patients (motor SQPS was normal for in 77% vs 44% [p = 0.017] whereas language SQPS was normal for 47% vs 100%). Conclusions: Although psychomotor/cognitive delay declines with age, there is no regression. In addition, encephalopathy is not a pure consequence of epilepsy but SCN1A mutation seems to play an additional, direct role."
24223551,Northwestern University Schizophrenia Data and Software Tool (NUSDAST),Lei Wang,"The schizophrenia research community has invested substantial resources on collecting, managing and sharing large neuroimaging datasets. As part of this effort, our group has collected high resolution magnetic resonance (MR) datasets from individuals with schizophrenia, their non-psychotic siblings, healthy controls and their siblings. This effort has resulted in a growing resource, the Northwestern University Schizophrenia Data and Software Tool (NUSDAST), an NIH-funded data sharing project to stimulate new research. This resource resides on XNAT Central, and it contains neuroimaging (MR scans, landmarks and surface maps for deep subcortical structures, and FreeSurfer cortical parcellation and measurement data), cognitive (cognitive domain scores for crystallized intelligence, working memory, episodic memory, and executive function), clinical (demographic, sibling relationship, SAPS and SANS psychopathology), and genetic (20 polymorphisms) data, collected from more than 450 subjects, most with 2-year longitudinal follow-up. A neuroimaging mapping, analysis and visualization software tool, CAWorks, is also part of this resource. Moreover, in making our existing neuroimaging data along with the associated meta-data and computational tools publically accessible, we have established a web-based information retrieval portal that allows the user to efficiently search the collection. This research-ready dataset meaningfully combines neuroimaging data with other relevant information, and it can be used to help facilitate advancing neuroimaging research. It is our hope that this effort will help to overcome some of the commonly recognized technical barriers in advancing neuroimaging research such as lack of local organization and standard descriptions."
24223448,Identifying Early Childhood Personality Dimensions Using the California Child Q-Set and Prospective Associations With Behavioral and Psychosocial Development,Sylia Wilson,"The present study used an empirical, ""bottom-up"" approach to delineate the structure of the California Child Q-Set (CCQ), a comprehensive set of personality descriptors, in a sample of 373 preschool-aged children. This approach yielded two broad trait dimensions, Adaptive Socialization (emotional stability, compliance, intelligence) and Anxious Inhibition (emotional/behavioral introversion). Results demonstrate the value of using empirical derivation to investigate the structure of personality in young children, speak to the importance of early-evident personality traits for adaptive development, and are consistent with a growing body of evidence indicating that personality structure in young children is similar, but not identical to, that in adults, suggesting a model of broad personality dimensions in childhood that evolve into narrower traits in adulthood."
24223110,Social judgement in borderline personality disorder,Katie Nicol,"Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a common and serious mental illness, associated with a high risk of suicide and self harm. Those with a diagnosis of BPD often display difficulties with social interaction and struggle to form and maintain interpersonal relationships. Here we investigated the ability of participants with BPD to make social inferences from faces. Method: 20 participants with BPD and 21 healthy controls were shown a series of faces and asked to judge these according to one of six characteristics (age, distinctiveness, attractiveness, intelligence, approachability, trustworthiness). The number and direction of errors made (compared to population norms) were recorded for analysis. Results: Participants with a diagnosis of BPD displayed significant impairments in making judgements from faces. In particular, the BPD Group judged faces as less approachable and less trustworthy than controls. Furthermore, within the BPD Group there was a correlation between scores on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and bias towards judging faces as unapproachable. Conclusion: Individuals with a diagnosis of BPD have difficulty making appropriate social judgements about others from their faces. Judging more faces as unapproachable and untrustworthy indicates that this group may have a heightened sensitivity to perceiving potential threat, and this should be considered in clinical management and treatment."
24222727,Children with congenital hypothyroidism have similar neuroradiological abnormal findings as healthy ones,Marianna Rachmiel,"Objective: To assess the neuroradiological findings of children with congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) compared to healthy controls (HC). Patients and methods: Thirty children with CHT, mean age 12.5 ± 1.6 years, 14 (44.8%) males, were compared with 38 HC mean age 11.7 ± 1.7 years, 16 (45.7%) males. Clinical data were collected from medical charts and questionnaires seeking information on family history, birth and perinatal period events, medications, and overall health history. Neurocognitive function was assessed for global intelligence, visual and verbal memory, and executive functioning using standardized tests. Neuroimaging was performed using 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging and assessed by two pediatric radiologists. Results: Children with CHT had a similar proportion of incidental findings as did the children in the HC group, at 43.3% and 39.5%, respectively, P = 0.69. Abnormalities of the sellar region were reported in 13.3% of CHT group and 7.9% of HC group, P = 0.46. Other incidental findings included cerebellar ectopia, choroidal fissure and pineal cysts, and multiple increased signal intensity foci. Neuroradiological findings were not associated with clinical and neurocognitive abnormalities. Conclusion: Neuroimaging of children with CHT demonstrated a similar incidence of structural abnormalities as in the healthy population. There is no association between those findings and neurocognitive function."
24222530,WISC-III cognitive profiles in children with developmental dyslexia: specific cognitive disability and diagnostic utility,Octávio Moura,"This study analysed the usefulness of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition in identifying specific cognitive impairments that are linked to developmental dyslexia (DD) and the diagnostic utility of the most common profiles in a sample of 100 Portuguese children (50 dyslexic and 50 normal readers) between the ages of 8 and 12 years. Children with DD exhibited significantly lower scores in the Verbal Comprehension Index (except the Vocabulary subtest), Freedom from Distractibility Index (FDI) and Processing Speed Index subtests, with larger effect sizes than normal readers in Information, Arithmetic and Digit Span. The Verbal-Performance IQs discrepancies, Bannatyne pattern and the presence of FDI; Arithmetic, Coding, Information and Digit Span subtests (ACID) and Symbol Search, Coding, Arithmetic and Digit Span subtests (SCAD) profiles (full or partial) in the lowest subtests revealed a low diagnostic utility. However, the receiver operating characteristic curve and the optimal cut-off score analyses of the composite ACID; FDI and SCAD profiles scores showed moderate accuracy in correctly discriminating dyslexic readers from normal ones. These results suggested that in the context of a comprehensive assessment, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition provides some useful information about the presence of specific cognitive disabilities in DD. Practitioner Points. Children with developmental dyslexia revealed significant deficits in the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition subtests that rely on verbal abilities, processing speed and working memory. The composite Arithmetic, Coding, Information and Digit Span subtests (ACID); Freedom from Distractibility Index and Symbol Search, Coding, Arithmetic and Digit Span subtests (SCAD) profile scores showed moderate accuracy in correctly discriminating dyslexics from normal readers. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition may provide some useful information about the presence of specific cognitive disabilities in developmental dyslexia."
24219393,Emotional intelligence predicts success in medical school,Nele Libbrecht,"Accumulating evidence suggests that effective communication and interpersonal sensitivity during interactions between doctors and patients impact therapeutic outcomes. There is an important need to identify predictors of these behaviors, because traditional tests used in medical admissions offer limited predictions of ""bedside manners"" in medical practice. This study examined whether emotional intelligence would predict the performance of 367 medical students in medical school courses on communication and interpersonal sensitivity. One of the dimensions of emotional intelligence, the ability to regulate emotions, predicted performance in courses on communication and interpersonal sensitivity over the next 3 years of medical school, over and above cognitive ability and conscientiousness. Emotional intelligence did not predict performance on courses on medical subject domains. The results suggest that medical schools may better predict who will communicate effectively and show interpersonal sensitivity if they include measures of emotional intelligence in their admission systems."
24219391,In the ear of the beholder: how age shapes emotion processing in nonverbal vocalizations,César F Lima,"It is well established that emotion recognition of facial expressions declines with age, but evidence for age-related differences in vocal emotions is more limited. This is especially true for nonverbal vocalizations such as laughter, sobs, or sighs. In this study, 43 younger adults (M = 22 years) and 43 older ones (M = 61.4 years) provided multiple emotion ratings of nonverbal emotional vocalizations. Contrasting with previous research, which often includes only one positive emotion (happiness) versus several negative ones, we examined 4 positive and 4 negative emotions: achievement/triumph, amusement, pleasure, relief, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. We controlled for hearing loss and assessed general cognitive decline, cognitive control, verbal intelligence, working memory, current affect, emotion regulation, and personality. Older adults were less sensitive than younger ones to the intended vocal emotions, as indicated by decrements in ratings on the intended emotion scales and accuracy. These effects were similar for positive and negative emotions, and they were independent of age-related differences in cognitive, affective, and personality measures. Regression analyses revealed that younger and older participants' responses could be predicted from the acoustic properties of the temporal, intensity, fundamental frequency, and spectral profile of the vocalizations. The two groups were similarly efficient in using the acoustic cues, but there were differences in the patterns of emotion-specific predictors. This study suggests that ageing produces specific changes on the processing of nonverbal vocalizations. That decrements were not attenuated for positive emotions indicates that they cannot be explained by a positivity effect in older adults."
24219314,The malleability of working memory and visuospatial skills: a randomized controlled study in older adults,Hana Stepankova,"There is accumulating evidence that training on working memory (WM) generalizes to other nontrained domains, and there are reports of transfer effects extending as far as to measures of fluid intelligence. Although there have been several demonstrations of such transfer effects in young adults and children, they have been difficult to demonstrate in older adults. In this study, we investigated the generalizing effects of an adaptive WM intervention on nontrained measures of WM and visuospatial skills. We randomly assigned healthy older adults to train on a verbal n-back task over the course of a month for either 10 or 20 sessions. Their performance change was compared with that of a control group. Our results revealed reliable group effects in nontrained standard clinical measures of WM and visuospatial skills in that both training groups outperformed the control group. We also observed a dose-response effect, that is, a positive relationship between training frequency and the gain in visuospatial skills; this finding was further confirmed by a positive correlation between training improvement and transfer. The improvements in visuospatial skills emerged even though the intervention was restricted to the verbal domain. Our work has important implications in that our data provide further evidence for plasticity of cognitive functions in old age."
24219022,Does evaluative pressure make you less or more distractible? Role of top-down attentional control over response selection,Alice Normand,"People's ability to resist cognitive distraction is crucial in many situations. The present research examines individuals' resistance to attentional distraction under conditions of evaluative pressure. In a series of 4 studies, participants had to complete various attentional tasks while believing their intelligence was or was not under the scrutiny of an experimenter. Using a spatial cuing paradigm, Studies 1 through 3 demonstrated that feeling evaluated led participants to implement stronger feature-based attentional control, which resulted in more (or less) distraction when irrelevant information matched (did not match) the searched-for target. Study 4 ruled out the possibility that the above effects were due to voluntary shifts of attention and demonstrated that the control settings implemented under evaluative pressure resulted in stronger goal-contingent response priming. Thus, the way individuals relate to the task-the performance context in which they are-induces strong attentional selection biases. Altogether, the present findings highlight an overlooked form of top-down modulation of attention based on performance self-relevance. Implications for both the current models of attentional control and the current hypotheses on the impact of evaluative pressure on cognition, as well as the consequences for more complex performances, are discussed."
24215564,"An investigation of cognitive test performance across conditions of silence, background noise and music as a function of neuroticism",James Reynolds,"The present study investigates the role of trait neuroticism on cognitive performance under distraction. Seventy participants were given a personality test and then undertook a number of different cognitive tasks in silence, in the presence of popular music and in background noise. It was predicted that performance on a general intelligence test, a test of abstract reasoning, and a mental arithmetic task would be adversely affected by background sounds. It was predicted that neuroticism would be negatively correlated with performance on the mental arithmetic task but only when the individuals were working in the presence of background sound. Stable vs. unstable participant's performance on a mental arithmetic task during noise was significantly higher as predicted. The results provided partial support for the hypotheses and are discussed with respect to previous findings in the literature on personality (particularly introversion-extraversion) and distraction on cognitive task performance. Limitations are noted."
24215257,Understanding how family socioeconomic status mediates the maternal intelligence-child cognitive outcomes relationship: a moderated mediation analysis,D Diego Torres,"In a model of moderated mediation using matched data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, Children and Young Adults, I test (1) whether family socioeconomic status (SES) mediates the maternal intelligence-child cognitive outcomes relationship and (2) the extent to which this mediating impact is dependent on the level of maternal intelligence. Results reveal that the mediating impact of SES on the maternal intelligence-child cognitive outcomes relationship varies as a function of the level of maternal intelligence. The positive effect of higher SES on children's academic ability decreases as the cognitive ability of mothers increases, such that children in low IQ households benefit most from higher SES, while children in high IQ households benefit somewhat less."
24212258,Narrowing the gap: effects of intervention on developmental trajectories in autism,Lars Klintwall,"Although still a matter of some debate, there is a growing body of research supporting Early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention as the intervention of choice for children with autism. Learning rate is an alternative to change in standard scores as an outcome measure in studies of early intervention. Learning rates can be displayed graphically as developmental trajectories, which are easy to understand and avoid some of the counter-intuitive properties of changes in standard scores. The data used in this analysis were from 453 children with autism, previously described by Eldevik et al. Children receiving Early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention exhibited significantly steeper developmental trajectories than children in the control group, in both intelligence and adaptive behaviors. However, there was a considerable variability in individual learning rates within the group receiving Early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention. This variability could partly be explained by the intensity of the treatment, partly by children's intake intelligence quotient age-equivalents. Age at intake did not co-vary with learning rate."
24212100,Dynamical and topological robustness of the mammalian cell cycle network: a reverse engineering approach,Gonzalo A Ruz,"A common gene regulatory network model is the threshold Boolean network, used for example to model the Arabidopsis thaliana floral morphogenesis network or the fission yeast cell cycle network. In this paper, we analyze a logical model of the mammalian cell cycle network and its threshold Boolean network equivalent. Firstly, the robustness of the network was explored with respect to update perturbations, in particular, what happened to the attractors for all the deterministic updating schemes. Results on the number of different limit cycles, limit cycle lengths, basin of attraction size, for all the deterministic updating schemes were obtained through mathematical and computational tools. Secondly, we analyzed the topology robustness of the network, by reconstructing synthetic networks that contained exactly the same attractors as the original model by means of a swarm intelligence approach. Our results indicate that networks may not be very robust given the great variety of limit cycles that a network can obtain depending on the updating scheme. In addition, we identified an omnipresent network with interactions that match with the original model as well as the discovery of new interactions. The techniques presented in this paper are general, and can be used to analyze other logical or threshold Boolean network models of gene regulatory networks."
24211492,Exposure to metals during pregnancy and neuropsychological development at the age of 4 years,Joan Forns,"Background: There is insufficient epidemiological evidence for deciding whether prenatal exposure to the current low-levels of metals in developed countries may affect neuropsychological function in early childhood. Objectives: Our goal was to evaluate potential neurotoxic effects of prenatal exposure to seven metals (cobalt, copper, arsenic, cadmium, antimony, thallium and lead), during the 1st and 3rd trimester of pregnancy, on child neuropsychological development at 4 years of age. Materials and methods: This study was based on a population-based birth cohort established in Sabadell (Catalonia, Spain) as part of the INMA [Environment and Childhood] Project. Metals were measured in 485 urine samples collected from mothers during the 1st and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. We assessed the neuropsychological development of 553 4-year-olds with the McCarthy Scales of Childrens' Abilitites (MSCA), together with their ADHD symptomatology, using the ADHD-DSM-IV criteria. A total of 385 children were included in the present study. Results: We found no statistically significant associations between metals and general cognitive scale or executive function of the MSCA. We found negative coefficients for the exposure to cadmium 1st trimester, cadmium 3rd trimester and lead 3rd trimester on the general cognitive score of MSCA, although these results were not significant. We did not find any association between prenatal exposure to metals and ADHD symptomatology at the age of 4 years. Conclusions: Our results do not suggest that prenatal exposure to current low-levels of metals impairs children's cognitive development during preschool years."
24211063,Relationships between ophthalmic artery flow direction and cognitive performance in patients with unilateral carotid artery stenosis,Kuo-Lun Huang,"Background: Cerebral hypoperfusion is responsible for cognitive impairment in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis (CAS). The manifestation of reversed ophthalmic artery flow (ROAF) is not uncommon in patients with CAS, suggesting a state of intensified cerebral hypoperfusion. This study aimed to examine whether the presence of ROAF can exacerbate cognitive impairment in patients with severe unilateral CAS. Methods: One-hundred-and-two patients with CAS and 37 age-matched volunteers participated in this case-control study. Depending on the side of CAS and occurrences of ROAF, the patients were allocated to four groups: left CAS groups with ROAF (n=28) or without ROAF (n=22), and right CAS groups with ROAF (n=26) or without ROAF (n=26). All subjects underwent a battery of neuropsychological tests. Results: All patients performed worse than the control group on most tests. No significant differences were observed between patient groups (ps>0.05), except for inferior performance on psychomotor speed and visuospatial tests in the right ROAF group (ps<0.03). Hierarchical regression analyses indicated strong contributions of estimated premorbid intelligence to performance on most tests (ps<0.05). The severity of left and right CAS was distinctively associated with different functions. To a lesser extent, the severity of infarcts was also associated with impairment of psychomotor speed and some executive functions (ps<0.05). The contributions of ROAF to performance on most tests were negligible. Conclusion: Patients with unilateral CAS may present with specific cognitive impairment relevant to the ipsilateral hemispheric functions. However, the manifestation of ROAF does not necessarily imply more extensive or severe cognitive impairment."
24210662,Inverse association between 18-carbon trans fatty acids and intelligence quotients in smoking schizophrenia patients,Szimonetta Lohner,"This study aimed to investigate polyunsaturated (PUFA) and trans isomeric fatty acid status in schizophrenia patients. Fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids (PL) and triacylglycerols (TG) was analyzed by gas chromatography in 29 schizophrenia patients and 15 healthy controls. We found no difference in PL n-3 fatty acid status between the two groups, while the values of 22:5n-6 were significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia than in controls. In TG, values of docosatrienoic acid (20:3n-3) and docosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) were significantly higher in schizophrenia patients than in controls. We found no difference in the trans fatty acid status between patients and controls. In smoking schizophrenia patients significant negative correlations were detected between Wechsler adult full-scale intelligence quotients and values of total trans fatty acids in PL lipids, whereas no such correlation was seen either in non-smoking schizophrenia patients, or in healthy controls. While data obtained in the present study fail to furnish evidence for n-3 PUFA supplementation to the diet of patients with schizophrenia, they indicate that in smoking schizophrenia patients high dietary exposure to trans fatty acids is associated with lower intelligence quotients."
24209608,Are neuropsychological deficits after trauma associated with ASD severity?,Sharain Suliman,"Acute stress disorder (ASD) is a fairly common sequela of traumatic exposure, and a significant proportion of those with the disorder go on to develop PTSD. Although neuropsychological deficits soon after trauma exposure have been associated with subsequent PTSD onset, few studies have assessed their association with ASD severity. We sought to investigate neuropsychological predictors of ASD severity in a sample of 128 motor vehicle accident (MVA) survivors, while controlling for potential confounders, such as demographic characteristics, other psychiatric diagnoses, and intelligence. We conducted clinical and neuropsychological assessments approximately 10.3 ± 4.5 days after an MVA. Our findings showed that delayed verbal recall was significantly associated with ASD severity, explaining 12.6% of the variance. However, a large proportion of the variance in ASD severity, 13.6%, was also explained by suicide risk. Effect size of the model was moderate (f(2) = 0.171). Suicide risk and delayed verbal recall appear to be moderately associated with ASD severity after a MVA and may be useful indicators of distress in in acute trauma survivors."
24206612,"Quantifying the effect of media limitations on outbreak data in a global online web-crawling epidemic intelligence system, 2008-2011",David Scales,"Background: This is the first study quantitatively evaluating the effect that media-related limitations have on data from an automated epidemic intelligence system. Methods: We modeled time series of HealthMap's two main data feeds, Google News and Moreover, to test for evidence of two potential limitations: first, human resources constraints, and second, high-profile outbreaks ""crowding out"" coverage of other infectious diseases. Results: Google News events declined by 58.3%, 65.9%, and 14.7% on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, respectively, relative to other weekdays. Events were reduced by 27.4% during Christmas/New Years weeks and 33.6% lower during American Thanksgiving week than during an average week for Google News. Moreover data yielded similar results with the addition of Memorial Day (US) being associated with a 36.2% reduction in events. Other holiday effects were not statistically significant. We found evidence for a crowd out phenomenon for influenza/H1N1, where a 50% increase in influenza events corresponded with a 4% decline in other disease events for Google News only. Other prominent diseases in this database - avian influenza (H5N1), cholera, or foodborne illness - were not associated with a crowd out phenomenon. Conclusions: These results provide quantitative evidence for the limited impact of editorial biases on HealthMap's web-crawling epidemic intelligence."
24205691,Clinical features of girls with Asperger disorders],Yuko Yamauchi,"Objectives: Symptoms of Asperger disorder (AD) in girls are often different from those in boys. In this study, the characteristics of girls with AD were examined. Methods: We retrospectively examined the records of 63 boys and 33 girls with AD. We evaluated the age, main problems, complications, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (3rd Ed) scores. Results: About 73% of girls were diagnosed with AD between 10 and 15 years of age, and they had physical complications or problems in the autonomic nervous system. Girls scored significantly lower in Mathematics score, and Block Design score than boys. Conclusions: The results suggest that there are differences in the AD symptoms exhibited by boys and girls. Further research is required to clarify the behavioral, neurological, and genetic links to these gender differences. In order to prevent secondary complications, it is necessary to establish specific diagnostic criteria for girls with AD."
24205689,Efficacy of visual cognitive function tests in health examinations of five-year-old children],Yuji Inaba,"Objective: Health examination programs for five-year-old children are aimed at effectively detecting developmental disorders, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders (AD/HD), learning disorders (LD), higher functioning autistic spectrum disorders (HFASD), and other abnormalities. Tests usually include a questionnaire and observation of group playing, verbal communication, and soft neurological signs; however, it is often difficult to detect children who have LD with visual cognitive dysfunctions through such conventional examination techniques. Here, we analyzed the efficacy of using a battery of visual cognitive function tests to identify such cases. Methods: We employed four simple tests to evaluate visual cognitive function in addition to a standard health examination for five-year-old between April 2008 and March 2010. To analyze visual cognitive function tests, the results were scored and the applicability of these tests was verified by comparisons with established tests. Results: A total of 653 five-year-old children underwent health examinations, and 48 children were referred to the hospital for further examinations. As a result, 34 children were newly diagnosed with developmental disorders, including HFASD, AD/HD, LD, and mild intellectual disturbances. Strong correlations were seen between the scores of these four examinations and those of other established tests, such as the performance intelligence score, the perceptual organization index of WISC-III, and the Frostig visual development test score. An additional benefit of our method was that parents could easily recognize developmental disorders in their children through direct observation of these examinations. Conclusions: We concluded that the battery of visual cognitive function tests was simple and useful for detecting developmental disorders in the health examinations of five-year-old children."
24204351,Linear combination of one-step predictive information with an external reward in an episodic policy gradient setting: a critical analysis,Keyan Zahedi,"One of the main challenges in the field of embodied artificial intelligence is the open-ended autonomous learning of complex behaviors. Our approach is to use task-independent, information-driven intrinsic motivation(s) to support task-dependent learning. The work presented here is a preliminary step in which we investigate the predictive information (the mutual information of the past and future of the sensor stream) as an intrinsic drive, ideally supporting any kind of task acquisition. Previous experiments have shown that the predictive information (PI) is a good candidate to support autonomous, open-ended learning of complex behaviors, because a maximization of the PI corresponds to an exploration of morphology- and environment-dependent behavioral regularities. The idea is that these regularities can then be exploited in order to solve any given task. Three different experiments are presented and their results lead to the conclusion that the linear combination of the one-step PI with an external reward function is not generally recommended in an episodic policy gradient setting. Only for hard tasks a great speed-up can be achieved at the cost of an asymptotic performance lost."
24201119,Intelligence two years after epilepsy surgery in children,Gerd Viggedal,"Intelligence before and two years after epilepsy surgery was assessed in 94 children and adolescents and related to preoperative IQ and seizure outcome. The median full-scale IQ was 70 before and two years after surgery. The proportion with a higher or unchanged postoperative IQ was 24 of 49 (49%) of those with an IQ of 70 and more before surgery, nine of 17 (53%) of those with an IQ of 50-69, and ten of 28 (36%) of those with an IQ of less than 50. A significant difference was found between the 47 individuals who became seizure-free and the 47 with persisting seizures, as 60% of the seizure-free children had a higher or unchanged IQ compared with 32% of the 47 who were not seizure-free. The cognitive outcome of children with intellectual disabilities was as good as that of children with average IQ. Thus, they should not be excluded from epilepsy surgery on the basis of low intellectual level."
24195205,Clinical research on children mental retardation treated with acupuncture],Jin-Bai Huang,"Objective: To observe the impacts of acupuncture on intelligent structure, social adaptability and fMRI brain function in children mental retardation (MR). Methods: Sixty cases of MR in compliance with the diagnostic standard were randomized into an acupuncture group and a medication group, 30 cases in each one. In the acupuncture group, Sishenzhen [four points, 1.5 cun anterior, posterior and bilateral to Baihui (GV 20)], Zhisanzhen [Shenting (GV 24), bilateral Benshen (GB 13)], Niesanzhen (the point 2 cun directly above the ear a-pex, the two points 1 cun bilateral the first point) and Naosanzhan [Naohu (GV 17) and bilateral Naohu (GB 19)] were selected as the main points. In the medication group, piracetam tablets were prescribed for oral administration. One course of treatment was 4 months in the two groups. The comprehensive efficacy was compared between the two groups at the end of treatment course. China-Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (C-WISC) was used to assess the intelligent improvements. Infant-Junior School Student Social Life Ability Scale was adopted to assess the improvements of social adaptability. Five cases were selected from the acupuncture group and fMRI was adopted to compare the brain function imaging changes before and after acupuncture treatment. Methods: In the acupuncture group, the final intelligence quotient (FIQ) and social adaptability score after treatment were higher than those before treatment (P<0.05), of which, the performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) was improved significantly, indicating the statistically significant difference (P<0.05). But the verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) did not change apparently (P>0.05). In the medication group, the changes in all the indices were not apparent before and after treatment (P>0.05). In comparison of the changes after treatment between the two groups, FIQ, PIQ and social adaptability score in the acupuncture group were improved more significantly as compared with the medication group (P<0.05). The fMRI brain function images did not change apparently before and after treatment in those 5 cases of the acupuncture group. Conclusion: Acupuncture promotes the intelligent recovery of MR children and improves their social adaptability. It indicates the satisfactory clinical efficacy. But, the fMRI brain function images do not change apparently before and after treatment."
24195010,Multi-agent system as a new approach to effective chronic heart failure management: key considerations,Niloofar Mohammadzadeh,"Objectives: Given the importance of the follow-up of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients to reduce common causes of re-admission and deterioration of their status that lead to imposing spiritual and physical costs on patients and society, modern technology tools should be used to the best advantage. The aim of this article is to explain key points which should be considered in designing an appropriate multi-agent system to improve CHF management. Methods: In this literature review articles were searched with keywords like multi-agent system, heart failure, chronic disease management in Science Direct, Google Scholar and PubMed databases without regard to the year of publications. Results: Agents are an innovation in the field of artificial intelligence. Because agents are capable of solving complex and dynamic health problems, to take full advantage of e-Health, the healthcare system must take steps to make use of this technology. Key factors in CHF management through a multi-agent system approach must be considered such as organization, confidentiality in general aspects and design and architecture points in specific aspects. Conclusions: Note that use of agent systems only with a technical view is associated with many problems. Hence, in delivering healthcare to CHF patients, considering social and human aspects is essential. It is obvious that identifying and resolving technical and non-technical challenges is vital in the successful implementation of this technology."
24194890,The relationship between trait emotional intelligence and interaction with ostracized others' retaliation,Yuki Nozaki,"Background: Regulation of emotions in others is distinct from other activities related to trait emotional intelligence in that only such behavior can directly change other people's psychological states. Although emotional intelligence has generally been associated with prosociality, emotionally intelligent people may manipulate others' behaviors to suit their own interests using high-level capabilities to read and manage the emotions of others. This study investigated how trait emotional intelligence was related to interacting with ostracized others who attempt retaliation. Method: We experimentally manipulated whether two people were simultaneously ostracized or not by using an online ball-tossing game called Cyberball. Eighty university students participated in Cyberball for manipulating ostracism and a ""recommendation game,"" a variation of the ultimatum game for assessing how to interact with others who attempt retaliation, with four participants. After the recommendation game, participants rated their intention to retaliate during the game. Results: People with higher interpersonal emotional intelligence were more likely to recommend that the ostracized other should inhibit retaliation and maximize additional rewards when they have a weaker intention to retaliate. However, they were more likely to recommend that the ostracized other should retaliate against the ostracizers when they have a stronger intention to retaliate. Conclusion: This is the first laboratory study that empirically reveals that people with high interpersonal emotional intelligence influence others' emotions based on their own goals contrary to the general view. Trait emotional intelligence itself is neither positive nor negative, but it can facilitate interpersonal behaviors for achieving goals. Our study offers valuable contributions for the refinement of the trait emotional intelligence concept in the respect of its social function."
24194441,"Cognitive, sensory, and psychosocial characteristics in patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome",Danielle D Brinckman,"Forty-two patients with a clinical diagnosis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome ages 2-61 years were given a neuropsychological test battery to evaluate cognitive, sensory, and behavioral functioning. These tests included the Wechsler scales of intelligence, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Boston Naming Test, D-KEFS Verbal Fluency Test, D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test, D-KEFS Sorting Test, Wide Range Achievement Test: Math and Reading Subtests, Purdue Pegboard, The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test, Social Communication Questionnaire, Social Responsiveness Scale, and Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition, Parent Rating Scale. On the age appropriate Wechsler scale, the mean Verbal Comprehension was 81 (n = 36), Working Memory was 81 (n = 36), Perceptual Reasoning was 78 (n = 24) and Full Scale IQ was 75 (n = 26). Memory for a word list (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test) was in the average range with a mean of 89 (n = 19). Fine motor speed was slow on the Purdue with mean scores 3-4 standard deviations below norms. All subjects were microsmic on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Of these 42 patients, only 6 were able to complete all auditory and visual tests; 52% were unable to complete the visual tests due to impaired vision. A wide range of behavioral issues were endorsed on questionnaires given to parents. Most had social skill deficits but no pattern of either externalizing or internalizing problems. We identify a characteristic neuro-behavioral profile in our cohort comprised of reduced IQ, impaired fine-motor function, and decreased olfaction."
24191777,A neurodevelopmental approach to understanding memory processes among intellectually gifted youth with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder,Ashley M Whitaker,"Intellectual giftedness is associated with strong strategic verbal memory while attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with strategic verbal memory deficits; however, no previous research has explored how this contradiction manifests in gifted populations with diagnoses of ADHD. The purpose of this study was to explore strategic verbal memory processes among intellectually gifted youth with and without ADHD to provide clarification regarding this specific aspect of neuropsychological functioning within this population. One hundred twenty-five youth completed neuropsychological evaluations including the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition and California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C). Results revealed significant differences between groups, with intellectually gifted youth with ADHD achieving lower T scores on CVLT-C Trials 1 through 5 compared with intellectually gifted youth without ADHD, and intellectually gifted youth with ADHD achieving higher T scores than youth of average intellectual abilities with ADHD. Additionally, repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a main effect improvement among gifted youth with ADHD in short-delay recall when provided with organizational cues. Findings revealed new evidence about the role of twice exceptionality (specifically intellectual giftedness and ADHD) in strategic verbal memory and have important implications for parents, educators, psychologists and neuropsychologists, and other mental health professionals working with this population."
24191011,Genetic basis of neurocognitive decline and reduced white-matter integrity in normal human brain aging,David C Glahn,"Identification of genes associated with brain aging should markedly improve our understanding of the biological processes that govern normal age-related decline. However, challenges to identifying genes that facilitate successful brain aging are considerable, including a lack of established phenotypes and difficulties in modeling the effects of aging per se, rather than genes that influence the underlying trait. In a large cohort of randomly selected pedigrees (n = 1,129 subjects), we documented profound aging effects from young adulthood to old age (18-83 y) on neurocognitive ability and diffusion-based white-matter measures. Despite significant phenotypic correlation between white-matter integrity and tests of processing speed, working memory, declarative memory, and intelligence, no evidence for pleiotropy between these classes of phenotypes was observed. Applying an advanced quantitative gene-by-environment interaction analysis where age is treated as an environmental factor, we demonstrate a heritable basis for neurocognitive deterioration as a function of age. Furthermore, by decomposing gene-by-aging (G × A) interactions, we infer that different genes influence some neurocognitive traits as a function of age, whereas other neurocognitive traits are influenced by the same genes, but to differential levels, from young adulthood to old age. In contrast, increasing white-matter incoherence with age appears to be nongenetic. These results clearly demonstrate that traits sensitive to the genetic influences on brain aging can be identified, a critical first step in delineating the biological mechanisms of successful aging."
24190959,Mental disorders across the adult life course and future coronary heart disease: evidence for general susceptibility,Catharine R Gale,"Background: Depression, anxiety, and psychotic disorders have been associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). It is unclear whether this association between mental health and CHD is present across a wider range of mental disorders. Methods and results: Participants were 1 107 524 Swedish men conscripted at a mean age of 18.3 years. Mental disorders were assessed by psychiatric interview on conscription, and data on hospital admissions for mental disorder and CHD were obtained from national registers during 22.6 years of follow-up. An increased risk of incident CHD was evident across a range of mental disorders whether diagnosed at conscription or on later hospital admission. Age-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) according to diagnoses at conscription ranged from 1.30 (1.05, 1.62) (depressive disorders) to 1.90 (1.58, 2.38) (alcohol-related disorders). [corrected]. The equivalent figures according to diagnoses during hospital admission ranged from 1.49 (1.24-1.80) (schizophrenia) to 2.82 (2.53-3.13) (other substance use disorders). Associations were little changed by adjustment for parental socioeconomic status, or body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and blood pressure measured at conscription, but they were partially attenuated by the adjustment for smoking, alcohol intake, and intelligence measured at conscription, and for education and own socioeconomic position. Conclusions: Increased risk of incident CHD is present across a range of mental disorders and is observable when the disorders are diagnosed at a young age."
24190441,An overview of studies on psychological well-being in children born following assisted reproductive technologies,Qi-tao Zhan,"Over the course of the past 35 years, assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) have been increasingly used worldwide, while debates on their safety have been generated. Birth defects and imprinting disorders were reported in previous research. Thus, the psychological development of children born following ARTs has become a major concern nowadays. This review gives a systematic view of psychological well-being of children conceived by different types of ART, including in vitro fertilization, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), preimplantation genetic diagnosis/screening, and in vitro maturation. The previous studies are analyzed in three sections: (1) cognitive, motor, and language developments, (2) behavior problems and socio-emotional development, and (3) parent-child relationship. We conclude that although the majority of the studies on cognitive, motor, and language developments reported comparable achievements in the ART group vs. the naturally conceived group, lower intelligence quotient (IQ) scores, worse visual-motor ability or locomotor development, and delayed receptive language competence were found in the ART group. The results on the socio-emotional development were reassuring. As for the behavior problems, a higher prevalence of behavior problems existed in ART children; moreover, ICSI children were found to be at a higher risk of autism than the general population. Meanwhile, ART parents tended to have positive parental attitudes and be more protective of their children. Some suggestions for further research are also given in this review."
24190124,Neurocognitive outcomes decades after treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the St Jude lifetime cohort study,Kevin R Krull,"Purpose: To determine rates, patterns, and predictors of neurocognitive impairment in adults decades after treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients and methods: Survivors of childhood ALL treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital who were still alive at 10 or more years after diagnosis and were age ≥ 18 years were recruited for neurocognitive testing. In all, 1,014 survivors were eligible, 738 (72.8%) agreed to participate, and 567 (76.8%) of these were evaluated. Mean age was 33 years; mean time since diagnosis was 26 years. Medical record abstraction was performed for data on doses of cranial radiation therapy (CRT) and cumulative chemotherapy. Multivariable modeling was conducted and glmulti package was used to select the best model with minimum Akaike information criterion. Results: Impairment rates across neurocognitive domains ranged from 28.6% to 58.9%, and those treated with chemotherapy only demonstrated increased impairment in all domains (all P values < .006). In survivors who received no CRT, dexamethasone was associated with impaired attention (relative risk [RR], 2.12; 95% CI, 1.11 to 4.03) and executive function (RR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.20 to 4.91). The impact of CRT was dependent on young age at diagnosis for intelligence, academic, and memory functions. Risk for executive function problems increased with survival time in a CRT dose-dependent fashion. In all survivors, self-reported behavior problems increased by 5% (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.09) with each year from diagnosis. Impairment was associated with reduced educational attainment and unemployment. Conclusion: This study demonstrates persistent and significant neurocognitive impairment in adult survivors of childhood ALL and warrants ongoing monitoring of brain health to facilitate successful adult development and to detect early onset of decline as survivors mature."
24188289,Bifactor structure of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence--Fourth Edition,Marley W Watkins,"The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence--Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV; Wechsler, 2012) represents a substantial departure from its predecessor, including omission of 4 subtests, addition of 5 new subtests, and modification of the contents of the 5 retained subtests. Wechsler (2012) explicitly assumed a higher-order structure with general intelligence (g) as the second-order factor that explained all the covariation of several first-order factors but failed to consider a bifactor model. The WPPSI-IV normative sample contains 1,700 children aged 2 years and 6 months through 7 years and 7 months, bifurcated into 2 age groups: 2:6-3:11 year olds (n = 600) and 4:0-7:7 year olds (n = 1,100). This study applied confirmatory factor analysis to the WPPSI-IV normative sample data to test the fit of a bifactor model and to determine the reliability of the resulting factors. The bifactor model fit the WPPSI-IV normative sample data as well as or better than the higher-order models favored by Wechsler (2012). In the bifactor model, the general factor accounted for more variance in every subtest than did its corresponding domain-specific factor and the general factor accounted for more total and common variance than all domain-specific factors combined. Further, the domain-specific factors exhibited poor reliability independent of g (i.e., ωh coefficients of .05 to .33). These results suggest that only the general intelligence dimension was sufficiently robust and precise for clinical use."
24188149,Whose IQ is it?--Assessor bias variance in high-stakes psychological assessment,Paul A McDermott,"Assessor bias variance exists for a psychological measure when some appreciable portion of the score variation that is assumed to reflect examinees' individual differences (i.e., the relevant phenomena in most psychological assessments) instead reflects differences among the examiners who perform the assessment. Ordinary test reliability estimates and standard errors of measurement do not inherently encompass assessor bias variance. This article reports on the application of multilevel linear modeling to examine the presence and extent of assessor bias in the administration of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) for a sample of 2,783 children evaluated by 448 regional school psychologists for high-stakes special education classification purposes. It was found that nearly all WISC-IV scores conveyed significant and nontrivial amounts of variation that had nothing to do with children's actual individual differences and that the Full Scale IQ and Verbal Comprehension Index scores evidenced quite substantial assessor bias. Implications are explored."
24188114,"Reading in subjects with an oral cleft: speech, hearing and neuropsychological skills",Amy L Conrad,"Objective: To evaluate speech, hearing, and neuropsychological correlates to reading among children, adolescents, and young adults with nonsyndromic cleft of the lip and/or palate (NSCL/P). Method: All testing was completed in a single visit at a Midwestern university hospital. Subjects in both the NSCL/P (n = 80) and the control groups (n = 62) ranged in age from 7-26 years (average age = 17.60 and 17.66, respectively). Subjects completed a battery of standardized tests evaluating intelligence, neuropsychological skills, and word reading. Subjects with NSCL/P also underwent speech assessment, and past audiology records were evaluated. Results: After controlling for age and socioeconomic status, subjects with cleft performed significantly worse on a test of word reading. For subjects with cleft, word reading deficits were not associated with measures of speech or hearing, but were correlated with impairments in auditory memory. Conclusion: These findings show poorer reading among subjects with NSCL/P compared with those without. Further work needs to focus on correlates of reading among subjects with cleft to allow early identification and appropriate intervention/accommodation for those at risk."
24188112,Duration of epilepsy and cognitive development in children: a longitudinal study,Loretta van Iterson,"Objective: To study the pattern of cognitive development in relation to duration of epilepsy. Methods: Participants were 113 children with epilepsy referred because of concerns about their cognitive development and tested at least twice at tertiary epilepsy settings. Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ were measured with Wechsler Intelligence Scales. Various epilepsy and demographic variables were included. Change over time was modeled with multilevel analysis for longitudinal data with variable measurement occasion. Results: The Verbal and Full Scales could be fitted best as a downward progressing function. Earlier in time, decline was likely to be largest; later in time, decline followed a continuous, dwindling course. A similar trend was seen for the Performance Scale. Initially, Verbal IQ was higher than Performance IQ but this discrepancy decreased over time. Later onset of epilepsy was associated with an attenuated decline of the Verbal Scale. None of the other epilepsy variables were related to the course of cognitive development. Higher parental education was associated with higher IQ, but was not protective against decline. Conclusions: Verbal IQ, though initially spared, drops. The Performance IQ, which may have shown its vulnerability earlier in the course of the epilepsy, shows overall smaller changes. It is suggested that seizures impact synergistically on an affected brain, which leads to progressive cognitive decline. Earlier onset of epilepsy is associated with relatively higher VIQ, larger VIQ > PIQ discrepancies and more decline."
24188065,The effect of intranasal oxytocin on perceiving and understanding emotion on the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT),Christopher Cardoso,"Evidence suggests that intranasal oxytocin enhances the perception of emotion in facial expressions during standard emotion identification tasks. However, it is not clear whether this effect is desirable in people who do not show deficits in emotion perception. That is, a heightened perception of emotion in faces could lead to ""oversensitivity"" to the emotions of others in nonclinical participants. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of intranasal oxytocin on emotion perception using ecologically valid social and nonsocial visual tasks. Eighty-two participants (42 women) self-administered a 24 IU dose of intranasal oxytocin or a placebo in a double-blind, randomized experiment and then completed the perceiving and understanding emotion components of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. In this test, emotion identification accuracy is based on agreement with a normative sample. As expected, participants administered intranasal oxytocin rated emotion in facial stimuli as expressing greater emotional intensity than those given a placebo. Consequently, accurate identification of emotion in faces, based on agreement with a normative sample, was impaired in the oxytocin group relative to placebo. No such effect was observed for tests using nonsocial stimuli. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that intranasal oxytocin enhances the salience of social stimuli in the environment, but not nonsocial stimuli. The present findings support a growing literature showing that the effects of intranasal oxytocin on social cognition can be negative under certain circumstances, in this case promoting ""oversensitivity"" to emotion in faces in healthy people."
24188038,"Rational thinking and cognitive sophistication: development, cognitive abilities, and thinking dispositions",Maggie E Toplak,"We studied developmental trends in 5 important reasoning tasks that are critical components of the operational definition of rational thinking. The tasks measured denominator neglect, belief bias, base rate sensitivity, resistance to framing, and the tendency toward otherside thinking. In addition to age, we examined 2 other individual difference domains that index cognitive sophistication: cognitive ability (intelligence and executive functioning) and thinking dispositions (actively open-minded thinking, superstitious thinking, and need for cognition). All 5 reasoning domains were consistently related to cognitive sophistication regardless of how it was indexed (age, cognitive ability, thinking dispositions). The implications of these findings for taxonomies of developmental trends in rational thinking tasks are discussed."
23971822,Actionable knowledge and strategic decision making for bio- and agroterrorism threats: building a collaborative early warning culture,Per-Åke Mårtensson,"Current trends in biosecurity and cybersecurity include (1) the wide availability of technology and specialized knowledge that previously were available only to governments; (2) the global economic recession, which may increase the spread of radical non-state actors; and (3) recent US and EU commission reports that reflect concerns about non-state actors in asymmetric threats. The intersectoral and international nature of bioterrorism and agroterrorism threats requires collaboration across several sectors including intelligence, police, forensics, customs, and other law enforcement organizations who must work together with public and animal health organizations as well as environmental and social science organizations. This requires coordinated decision making among these organizations, based on actionable knowledge and information sharing. The risk of not sharing information among organizations compared to the benefit of sharing information can be considered in an ""information sharing risk-benefit analysis"" to prevent a terrorism incident from occurring and to build a rapid response capability. In the EU project AniBioThreat, early warning is the main topic in work package 3 (WP 3). A strategy has been generated based on an iterative approach to bring law enforcement agencies and human and animal health institutes together. Workshops and exercises have taken place during the first half of the project, and spin-off activities include new preparedness plans for institutes and the formation of a legal adviser network for decision making. In addition, a seminar on actionable knowledge was held in Stockholm, Sweden, in 2012, which identified the need to bring various agency cultures together to work on developing a resilient capability to identify early signs of bio- and agroterrorism threats. The seminar concluded that there are a number of challenges in building a collaborative culture, including developing an education program that supports collaboration and shared situational awareness."
23971817,Social media and its dual use in biopreparedness: communication and visualization tools in an animal bioterrorism incident,Elisabeth Sjöberg,"This article focuses on social media and interactive challenges for emergency organizations during a bioterrorism or agroterrorism incident, and it outlines the dual-use dilemma of social media. Attackers or terrorists can use social media as their modus operandi, and defenders, including emergency organizations in law enforcement and public and animal health, can use it for peaceful purposes. To get a better understanding of the uses of social media in these situations, a workshop was arranged in Stockholm, Sweden, to raise awareness about social media and animal bioterrorism threats. Fifty-six experts and crisis communicators from international and national organizations participated. As a result of the workshop, it was concluded that emergency organizations can collect valuable information and monitor social media before, during, and after an outbreak. In order to make use of interactive communication to obtain collective intelligence from the public, emergency organizations must adapt to social networking technologies, requiring multidisciplinary knowledge in the fields of information, communication, IT, and biopreparedness. Social network messaging during a disease outbreak can be visualized in stream graphs and networks showing clusters of Twitter and Facebook users. The visualization of social media can be an important preparedness tool in the response to bioterrorism and agroterrorism."
23971814,Agroterrorism targeting livestock: a review with a focus on early detection systems,Armin Elbers,"Agroterrorism targeting livestock can be described as the intentional introduction of an animal disease agent against livestock with the purpose of causing economic damage, disrupting socioeconomic stability of a country, and creating panic and distress. This type of terrorism can be alluring to terrorists because animal disease agents are easily available. This review addresses the vulnerabilities of the livestock industry to agroterrorism. However, we also show that early detection systems have recently been developed for agroterrorism and deliberate spread of animal pathogens in livestock, including an agroterrorism intelligence cycle, syndromic surveillance programs, and computer-based clinical decision support systems that can be used for early detection of notifiable animal diseases. The development of DIVA-vaccines in the past 10 to 15 years has created, in principle, an excellent response instrument to counter intentional animal disease outbreaks. These developments have made our animal agriculture less vulnerable to agroterrorism. But we cannot relax; there are still many challenges, in particular with respect to integration of first line of defense, law enforcement, and early detection systems for animal diseases."
24187609,Predicting performance on the Raven's Matrices: The roles of associative learning and retrieval efficiency,Lindsey Lilienthal,"Previous studies have shown that performance on Williams and Pearlberg's (2006) complex associative learning task is a good predictor of fluid intelligence. This task is similar in structure to that used in studying the fan effect (Anderson, 1974), as both tasks involve forming multiple associations and require retrieval in the face of interference. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relations among complex associative learning, working memory, and fluid intelligence. Specifically, we asked whether retrieval efficiency, as measured by the fan effect, could account for the relation between complex associative learning and performance on Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices. Consistent with previous findings, complex associative learning predicted Raven's performance, but the fan effect did not account for this relation. Notably, the learning phase of the fan effect task was significantly correlated with both complex associative learning and Raven's performance, providing further support for the importance of learning as a predictor of fluid intelligence."
24185090,Psychotic symptoms in normal pressure hydrocephalus,S Chatziioannidis,"Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus due to idiopathic aqueductal stenosis is a chronic abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the cerebral ventricles caused by an obstruction in the Sylvian aqueduct. This leads to a dilatation of the ventricular system and to subsequent damage of the adjacent parenchyma. Although NPH typically presents with the progressive 'triad' of cognitive impairment, gait disturbance and urinary incontinence, it has been described that it rarely manifests in the form of predominant psychotic symptoms. It has been suggested that thought and perceptual disorders could develop secondary to the damage caused by NPH. Although precise anatomical correlates have not yet been established, certain cerebral regions -primarily the frontal cortex, mesencephalic and diencephalic structures of the brain- have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalic psychosis. Because frontal lobe lesions are traditionally known to facilitate one's inability to integrate and correct perceptual distortions in the face of contradictory evidence, frontal lobe dysfunction may be integral in delineating the etiology of delusions in NPH. We present the case of a 30-year-old female, admitted involuntarily to our acute psychiatric department because she exhibited aggressive behavior while being in an agitated state with delusions of persecution. Her neurological examination disclosed subtle bradykinesia. Neuropsychological batteries and intelligence testing revealed mild cognitive impairment and a CT scan showed considerable dilatation of the ventricular system due to idiopathic aqueductal stenosis. While a conservative approach was chosen for the treatment of NPH, our patient was initiated on 2nd generation antipsychotics showing marked improvement of her psychiatric symptomatology. The atypical presentation of hydrocephalus in the aforementioned case underlines the necessity to thoroughly investigate the possible presence of an underlying organic factor in those patients who present with predominant psychotic symptoms in association with soft non-localising neurological signs and mild cognitive deficits. Furthermore, our patient's marked improvement indicates that, in cases where the primary cause is treated conservatively, hydrocephalic psychosis could respond to 2nd generation antipsychotics. In light of this case report, we reviewed past and present literature on the matter."
24184301,Cognitive and behavioral heterogeneity in genetic syndromes,Luiz F L Pegoraro,"Objective: this study aimed to investigate the cognitive and behavioral profiles, as well as the psychiatric symptoms and disorders in children with three different genetic syndromes with similar sociocultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. Methods: thirty-four children aged 6 to 16 years, with Williams-Beuren syndrome (n=10), Prader-Willi syndrome (n=11), and Fragile X syndrome (n=13) from the outpatient clinics of Child Psychiatry and Medical Genetics Department were cognitively assessed through the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III). Afterwards, a full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ), verbal IQ, performance IQ, standard subtest scores, as well as frequency of psychiatric symptoms and disorders were compared among the three syndromes. Results: significant differences were found among the syndromes concerning verbal IQ and verbal and performance subtests. Post-hoc analysis demonstrated that vocabulary and comprehension subtest scores were significantly higher in Williams-Beuren syndrome in comparison with Prader-Willi and Fragile X syndromes, and block design and object assembly scores were significantly higher in Prader-Willi syndrome compared with Williams-Beuren and Fragile X syndromes. Additionally, there were significant differences between the syndromes concerning behavioral features and psychiatric symptoms. The Prader-Willi syndrome group presented a higher frequency of hyperphagia and self-injurious behaviors. The Fragile X syndrome group showed a higher frequency of social interaction deficits; such difference nearly reached statistical significance. Conclusion: the three genetic syndromes exhibited distinctive cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric patterns."
24183735,Role of plasma homocysteine levels and MTHFR polymorphisms on IQ scores in children and young adults with epilepsy treated with antiepileptic drugs,Gabriella Di Rosa,"Homocysteine (Hcy) is a sulfur-containing amino acid involved in methionine metabolism. High plasma total Hcy (tHcy) has been quite frequently reported in patients with epilepsy treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) mainly related to plasma folate reduction induced by AEDs themselves. The role of C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) on the increase of plasma tHcy in patients with epilepsy taking AEDs is still controversial. Cognitive impairment may be associated with epilepsy either as the result of the epileptic syndrome per se or as a side effect induced by the AEDs. High plasma tHcy levels were associated with lower cognitive performances in patients affected by Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment and in healthy elderly. We searched for a correlation between plasma tHcy levels with the intelligence quotient (IQ) scores in a population of children and young adults with epilepsy treated with old and/or newer AEDs. The study group encompassed 179 patients (92 M, 51.5%) followed at our Unit of Child Neuropsychiatry and aged between 4 and 25years (mean+SD: 14.03±4.25). The inclusion criteria included the following: 1) diagnosis of epilepsy of ""unknown cause"" (cryptogenic) according to the ILAE classification, 2) age older than 3years, 3) stabilized antiepileptic treatment for at least 6months, and 4) clinical records of cognitive tests, plasma tHcy value, and results of MTHFR polymorphisms. Patients' mean tHcy value was 9.71±3.13μM/L (tHcy<9μM/L as our laboratory cutoff in nonepileptic controls). The mean TIQ score was 85.22 (SD±24.12); the mean VIQ score was 86.32 (SD±20.86); and the mean PIQ score was 86.94 (SD±21.51). C677T and A1298C MTHFR polymorphisms were detected in 74/92 (80%) examined patients and distributed into the following: CT (22.3%), TT (14.9%), CC (10.3%) for C677T, AC (16%), CC (1.1%), and AA (30.3%) for A1298C. Plasma tHcy levels were not significantly related to the IQ scores (TIQ, VIQ, or PIQ). Two significant findings came out. First, patients on AED polytherapy showed significantly lower TIQ, VIQ, and PIQ scores compared with the ones with AED monotherapy (p=0.032; p=0.008; p=0.005, respectively). However, this significant difference was not observed with the plasma tHcy levels compared with AED treatment. Second, patients with the 677TT genotype showed significantly higher tHcy levels versus those with the wt ones (p=0.049). In the latter group of patients, although the mean TIQ score was lower compared with the mean TIQ score in those with the wt ones, the difference only approached statistical significance (p=0.056). To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the relationship between tHcy levels and cognitive scores in children with epilepsy treated with AEDs. Analysis of wider samples, selective neuropsychological tests, and prospective recruitment of patients might be encouraged."
24180760,Classification of mysticete sounds using machine learning techniques,Xanadu C Halkias,"Automatic classification of mysticete sounds has long been a challenging task in the bioacoustics field. The unknown statistical properties of the signals as well as the use of different recording apparatus and low signal-to-noise ratio conditions often lead to non-optimal systems. The goal of this paper is to design methods for the automatic classification of mysticete sounds using a restricted Boltzmann machine and a sparse auto-encoder that are widely used in the field of artificial intelligence. Experiments on five species of mysticetes are presented. The different methods are employed on the subset of species whose frequency range overlaps, as well as in all five species' calls. Moreover, results are offered with and without the use of a noise class. Overall, the systems are able to achieve an average classification accuracy of over 69% (with noise) and 80% (without noise) given the different architectures."
24179854,White matter microstructure correlates with autism trait severity in a combined clinical-control sample of high-functioning adults,Clare R Gibbard,"Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have demonstrated white matter (WM) abnormalities in tracts involved in emotion processing in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but little is known regarding the nature and distribution of WM anomalies in relation to ASD trait severity in adults. Increasing evidence suggests that ASD occurs at the extreme of a distribution of social abilities. We aimed to examine WM microstructure as a potential marker for ASD symptom severity in a combined clinical-neurotypical population. SIENAX was used to estimate whole brain volume. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to provide a voxel-wise comparison of WM microstructure in 50 high-functioning young adults: 25 ASD and 25 neurotypical. The severity of ASD traits was measured by autism quotient (AQ); we examined regressions between DTI markers of WM microstructure and ASD trait severity. Cognitive abilities, measured by intelligence quotient, were well-matched between the groups and were controlled in all analyses. There were no significant group differences in whole brain volume. TBSS showed widespread regions of significantly reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) and radial diffusivity (RD) in ASD compared with controls. Linear regression analyses in the combined sample showed that average whole WM skeleton FA was negatively influenced by AQ (p = 0.004), whilst MD and RD were positively related to AQ (p = 0.002; p = 0.001). Regression slopes were similar within both groups and strongest for AQ social, communication and attention switching scores. In conclusion, similar regression characteristics were found between WM microstructure and ASD trait severity in a combined sample of ASD and neurotypical adults. WM anomalies were relatively more severe in the clinically diagnosed sample. Both findings suggest that there is a dimensional relationship between WM microstructure and severity of ASD traits from neurotypical subjects through to clinical ASD, with reduced coherence of WM associated with greater ASD symptoms. General cognitive abilities were independent of the relationship between WM indices and ASD traits."
24179795,Disturbed resting state EEG synchronization in bipolar disorder: A graph-theoretic analysis,Dae-Jin Kim,"Disruption of functional connectivity may be a key feature of bipolar disorder (BD) which reflects disturbances of synchronization and oscillations within brain networks. We investigated whether the resting electroencephalogram (EEG) in patients with BD showed altered synchronization or network properties. Resting-state EEG was recorded in 57 BD type-I patients and 87 healthy control subjects. Functional connectivity between pairs of EEG channels was measured using synchronization likelihood (SL) for 5 frequency bands (δ, θ, α, β, and γ). Graph-theoretic analysis was applied to SL over the electrode array to assess network properties. BD patients showed a decrease of mean synchronization in the alpha band, and the decreases were greatest in fronto-central and centro-parietal connections. In addition, the clustering coefficient and global efficiency were decreased in BD patients, whereas the characteristic path length increased. We also found that the normalized characteristic path length and small-worldness were significantly correlated with depression scores in BD patients. These results suggest that BD patients show impaired neural synchronization at rest and a disruption of resting-state functional connectivity."
24179291,Self-reported sleep correlates with prefrontal-amygdala functional connectivity and emotional functioning,William D S Killgore,"Study objectives: Prior research suggests that sleep deprivation is associated with declines in some aspects of emotional intelligence and increased severity on indices of psychological disturbance. Sleep deprivation is also associated with reduced prefrontal-amygdala functional connectivity, potentially reflecting impaired top-down modulation of emotion. It remains unknown whether this modified connectivity may be observed in relation to more typical levels of sleep curtailment. We examined whether self-reported sleep duration the night before an assessment would be associated with these effects. Design: Participants documented their hours of sleep from the previous night, completed the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i), Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), and Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Setting: Outpatient neuroimaging center at a private psychiatric hospital. Participants: Sixty-five healthy adults (33 men, 32 women), ranging in age from 18-45 y. Interventions: N/A. Measurements and results: Greater self-reported sleep the preceding night was associated with higher scores on all scales of the EQ-i but not the MSCEIT, and with lower symptom severity scores on half of the psychopathology scales of the PAI. Longer sleep was also associated with stronger negative functional connectivity between the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Moreover, greater negative connectivity between these regions was associated with higher EQ-i and lower symptom severity on the PAI. Conclusions: Self-reported sleep duration from the preceding night was negatively correlated with prefrontal-amygdala connectivity and the severity of subjective psychological distress, while positively correlated with higher perceived emotional intelligence. More sleep was associated with higher emotional and psychological strength."
24177318,An SVM-based high-quality article classifier for systematic reviews,Seunghee Kim,"Objective: To determine whether SVM-based classifiers, which are trained on a combination of inclusion and common exclusion articles, are useful to experts reviewing journal articles for inclusion during new systematic reviews. Methods: Test collections were built using the annotated reference files from 19 procedure and 4 drug systematic reviews. The classifiers were trained by balanced data sets, which were sampled using random sampling. This approach compared two balanced data sets, one with a combination of included and commonly excluded articles and one with a combination of included and excluded articles. AUCs were used as evaluation metrics. Results: The AUCs of the classifiers, which were trained on the balanced data set with included and commonly excluded articles, were significantly higher than those of the classifiers, which were trained on the balanced data set with included and excluded articles. Conclusion: Automatic, high-quality article classifiers using machine learning could reduce the workload of experts performing systematic reviews when topic-specific data are scarce. In particular, when used as training data, a combination of included and commonly excluded articles is more helpful than a combination of included and excluded articles."
24176978,SIL1 mutations and clinical spectrum in patients with Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome,Michael Krieger,"Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder featuring cerebellar ataxia, early-onset cataracts, chronic myopathy, variable intellectual disability and delayed motor development. More recently, mutations in the SIL1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum resident co-chaperone, were identified as the main cause of Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome. Here we describe the results of SIL1 mutation analysis in 62 patients presenting with early-onset ataxia, cataracts and myopathy or combinations of at least two of these. We obtained a mutation detection rate of 60% (15/25) among patients with the characteristic Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome triad (ataxia, cataracts, myopathy) whereas the detection rate in the group of patients with more variable phenotypic presentation was below 3% (1/37). We report 16 unrelated families with a total of 19 different SIL1 mutations. Among these mutations are 15 previously unreported changes, including single- and multi-exon deletions. Based on data from our screening cohort and data compiled from the literature we found that SIL1 mutations are invariably associated with the combination of a cerebellar syndrome and chronic myopathy. Cataracts were observed in all patients beyond the age of 7 years, but might be missing in infants. Six patients with SIL1 mutations had no intellectual disability, extending the known wide range of cognitive capabilities in Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome to include normal intelligence. Modestly constant features were somatic growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities and pyramidal tract signs. Examination of mutant SIL1 expression in cultured patient lymphoblasts suggested that SIL1 mutations result in severely reduced SIL1 protein levels irrespective of the type and position of mutations. Our data broaden the SIL1 mutation spectrum and confirm that SIL1 is the major Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome gene. SIL1 patients usually present with the characteristic triad but cataracts might be missing in young children. As cognitive impairment is not obligatory, patients without intellectual disability but a Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome-compatible phenotype should receive SIL1 mutation analysis. Despite allelic heterogeneity and many families with private mutations, the phenotype related to SIL1 mutations is relatively homogenous. Based on SIL1 expression studies we speculate that this may arise from a uniform effect of different mutations on protein expression."
24175682,Phonological awareness and oral language proficiency in learning to read English among Chinese kindergarten children in Hong Kong,Susanna S Yeung,"Background: Learning to read is very challenging for Hong Kong children who learn English as a second language (ESL), as they must acquire two very different writing systems, beginning at the age of three. Few studies have examined the role of phonological awareness at the subsyllabic levels, oral language proficiency, and L1 tone awareness in L2 English reading among Hong Kong ESL kindergarteners. Aims: This study aims to investigate L1 and L2 phonological awareness and oral language proficiency as predictors of English reading among children with Chinese as L1. Sample: One hundred and sixty-one typically developing children with a mean age of 5.16 (SD=.35) selected from seven preschools in Hong Kong. Method: Participants were assessed for English reading, English and Chinese phonological awareness at different levels, English oral language skills, and letter naming ability. Results: Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that both oral language proficiency and phonological awareness measures significantly predicted L2 word reading, when statistically controlled for age and general intelligence. Among various phonological awareness units, L2 phonemic awareness was the best predictor of L2 word reading. Cross-language transfer was shown with L1 phonological awareness at the tone level, uniquely predicting L2 word reading. Conclusions: The present findings show the important role of phonological awareness at the subsyllabic levels (rime and phoneme) and oral language proficiency in the course of L2 reading development in Chinese ESL learners. The significant contribution of L1 tone awareness to L2 reading suggests that phonological sensitivity is a general competence that ESL children need to acquire in early years. The findings have significant implications for understanding L2 reading development and curriculum development."
24175457,Attachment pattern and cognitive skills: an exploratory study in an Italian non-clinical sample,Elisa Delvecchio,"Bowlby (1973) stated that the attachment relationship between a child and parents might help the child learn many skills important for survival, with a lifelong effect. However, there is a scarcity of research into attachment and intelligence in adulthood. This study examines the relationship between attachment status and cognitive skills in an Italian non-clinical sample of 101 young adults (M age = 22.6 yr.; SD = 1.8). The Adult Attachment Projective Picture Stimuli and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised were administered to participants and four-way attachment classifications were analyzed regarding participants' IQ. Statistically significant differences were found for Full Scale IQ and Verbal IQ, with Dismissing participants scoring higher than Unresolved participants. Similar results were obtained for two-way attachment patterns with Resolved participants scoring higher than Unresolved. Implications regarding different attachment patterns and the concept of trauma are discussed."
24175447,Autobiographical remembering and individual differences in emotional intelligence,Kohsuke Yamamoto,"The relationship between individual differences in Emotional Intelligence (EI) and self-reported arousal from remembering an autobiographical emotional or neutral event was examined. Participants (N = 235; 75 men; M age = 18.7 yr., SD = 0.9, range = 18-22) were required to complete the Japanese version of the Emotional Skills and Competence Questionnaire to assess EI. Participants were then asked to recall personal episodes from autobiographical memory, and then completed the Memory Characteristics Questionnaire (MCQ). A group with high EI-rated, emotionally neutral episodes higher than did a group with low EI on several MCQ subscales: sound, participants, overall memory, and doubt/certainty. However, differences in ratings between the two groups were not observed for emotionally positive episodes. These results suggest that high EI is related to more effective use of weak retrieval cues when recalling neutral autobiographical memories."
32847303,Psychiatric disorders in an urban sample of preschool children,Olafur O Gudmundsson,"Background: To increase limited epidemiological knowledge of early childhood psychopathology, a study of prevalence estimates and demographic correlates of psychiatric disorders was conducted in a sample of preschool children. Methods: In a two-stage study, parents of 339 children aged 4-6 years who came for a medical check-up at three primary care centres in Reykjavik were invited to participate. First, the participants were screened with Brigance Screens and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for parents and teachers. Subsequently, the children were tested with a short version of Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence - Revised and their parents were interviewed with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children Present and Lifetime Version. Weighted prevalence estimates were calculated and logistic regression was used to analyse the association between risk factors and psychiatric disorders. Results: Of those invited to participate, 317 (93.5%) were included in the screening and of those, 131 received a full diagnostic assessment. The final study sample included 151 girls (47.6%) and 166 boys (52.4%) who represented 11.6% of the total birth cohort in Reykjavik. Weighted prevalence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders was 10.1% (95% CI 6.7-13.5%) and 57/317 or 18.0% (95% CI 13.8-22.2%), including elimination disorders. Anxiety disorders (5.7%) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (3.8%) were the most common disorders in this preschool sample. Poor physical health of parents and higher education was associated with DSM-IV psychiatric disorders of the children. SDQ Total Difficulties score was associated with male gender and poor physical health of parents. Conclusions: This study indicates that psychiatric disorders in preschool children are common and may be correlated with parental health factors."
25729466,Identification as Gifted and Implicit Beliefs About Intelligence: An Examination of Potential Moderators,Kate E Snyder,"The current study investigated whether the developmental timing of a student's identification as gifted (i.e., when a student is first identified) was associated with later implicit beliefs about intelligence, and whether this relation is moderated by academic ability. A sample of 1,743 high-ability college students reported on whether and when they had been identified as gifted, academic ability (SAT scores), and implicit beliefs of intelligence. Timing of identification was unrelated to implicit beliefs; academic ability was the only significant predictor. Higher ability students who had been previously identified as gifted at any point in time reported implicit beliefs more toward entity beliefs than relatively lower ability students who had also been identified; however, this effect was quite small. Implicit beliefs did not vary by ability level for nonidentified students. These findings suggest that identification as gifted at any age modestly (but not necessarily meaningfully) relates to implicit beliefs for high-ability students."
24174944,Intelligence quotient in children with congenital hypothyroidism: The effect of diagnostic and treatment variables,Seyed Badredin Najmi,"Background: Considering the high prevalence of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in Isfahan, the intelligence quotient (IQ) of children with CH and the effect of diagnostic and treatment variables on it were investigated during the CH screening program. Materials and methods: A total of 120 children in three studied groups were studied in this comparative study the IQ score, in three subsets of verbal IQ, performance IQ and full scale IQ, of children diagnosed with transient congenital hypothyroidism (TCH) and permanent congenital hypothyroidism (PCH) was measured using revised Wechsler pre-school and primary scale of intelligence and compared with the control group. The relation between IQ score with time of treatment initiation and screening thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level was evaluated in all studied groups. Results: Mean of verbal IQ, performance IQ, and full scale IQ score was significantly higher in the control group than CH patients (both permanent and transient) In PCH patients though it was not significant, there was a negative relationship between verbal IQ, performance IQ and full scale IQ and screening TSH and age of treatment initiation. In TCH patients, there was negative and significant relationship between verbal IQ (r = -0.40) and full scale IQ (r = -0.38) and age of treatment initiation (r = -0.46). Conclusion: Mean IQ score in both PCH and TCH patients were lower than the control group, which correlates negatively with treatment initiation time. Though CH screening and early treatment has improved the prognosis of patients, but early and high dose of treatment in children with CH is recommended."
24171931,Developmental reversals in risky decision making: intelligence agents show larger decision biases than college students,Valerie F Reyna,"Intelligence agents make risky decisions routinely, with serious consequences for national security. Although common sense and most theories imply that experienced intelligence professionals should be less prone to irrational inconsistencies than college students, we show the opposite. Moreover, the growth of experience-based intuition predicts this developmental reversal. We presented intelligence agents, college students, and postcollege adults with 30 risky-choice problems in gain and loss frames and then compared the three groups' decisions. The agents not only exhibited larger framing biases than the students, but also were more confident in their decisions. The postcollege adults (who were selected to be similar to the students) occupied an interesting middle ground, being generally as biased as the students (sometimes more biased) but less biased than the agents. An experimental manipulation testing an explanation for these effects, derived from fuzzy-trace theory, made the students look as biased as the agents. These results show that, although framing biases are irrational (because equivalent outcomes are treated differently), they are the ironical output of cognitively advanced mechanisms of meaning making."
24171883,Coronary Heart Disease and Emotional Intelligence,Chrisanthy Vlachaki,"Background: Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is associated with emotions, especially negative ones, namely anxiety and depression. Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a psychological model that consists of a variety of emotional skills. Aims: The aim of the present study was to examine the relation between different dimensions of Emotional Intelligence and coronary heart disease. Methods: A total of 300 participants were studied during a 3-year period in an attempt to partially replicate and further expand a previous study conducted in Greece among CHD patients, which indicated a strong association between certain dimensions of Emotional Intelligence and the incidence of CHD. All participants completed a self-report questionnaire, assessing several aspects of Emotional Intelligence. Findings: The results showed that there is a link between the regulation of emotions and the occurrence of CHD. Conclusions: The evidence reported in the present study makes stronger the claim that EI plays a significant role in the occurrence of CHD."
24170697,Neuroanatomical correlates of dysglycemia in young children with type 1 diabetes,Matthew J Marzelli,"Studies of brain structure in type 1 diabetes (T1D) describe widespread neuroanatomical differences related to exposure to glycemic dysregulation in adults and adolescents. In this study, we investigate the neuroanatomical correlates of dysglycemia in very young children with early-onset T1D. Structural magnetic resonance images of the brain were acquired in 142 children with T1D and 68 age-matched control subjects (mean age 7.0 ± 1.7 years) on six identical scanners. Whole-brain volumetric analyses were conducted using voxel-based morphometry to detect regional differences between groups and to investigate correlations between regional brain volumes and measures of glycemic exposure (including data from continuous glucose monitoring). Relative to control subjects, the T1D group displayed decreased gray matter volume (GMV) in bilateral occipital and cerebellar regions (P < 0.001) and increased GMV in the left inferior prefrontal, insula, and temporal pole regions (P = 0.002). Within the T1D group, hyperglycemic exposure was associated with decreased GMV in medial frontal and temporal-occipital regions and increased GMV in lateral prefrontal regions. Cognitive correlations of intelligence quotient to GMV were found in cerebellar-occipital regions and medial prefrontal cortex for control subjects, as expected, but not for the T1D group. Thus, early-onset T1D affects regions of the brain that are associated with typical cognitive development."
24169333,Electroencephalogram evaluation of hyperphenylalaninemia patients on dietetic treatments],Kun-di Wang,"Objective: To explore the electroencephalographic changes of patients with hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) after dietetic treatments. Methods: From July 2005 to February 2010, 34 HPA patients with abnormal electroencephalograms were recruited from China-Japan Friendship Hospital. Their electroencephalographic results and clinical features were compared before and after dietetic and antiepileptic treatments. There were 16 males and 18 females with an age range of 2 months to 8 years. All electroencephalographic results were abnormal. Among them, there were epileptic discharges (n = 17), atypical sharp-slow wave complex (n = 1) and slow wave background (n = 16). All patients received a low intake of phenylalanine at 13-50 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1). Twenty patients had antiepileptic drug therapy. Before and after treatment for 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years, blood phenylalanine concentration, electroencephalogram, convulsion and other clinical parameters were observed. Before and after 1 year treatment, the tests of developmental quotient (DQ) or intelligence quotient (IQ) were performed. Results: The phenylalanine concentrations of the same patient group decreased significantly after 3 months, 6 months, 1 and 2 years after dietetic treatment ( (0.51 ± 0.39) , (0.50 ± 0.29), (0.59 ± 0.42), (0.53 ± 0.27) vs (1.33 ± 0.64) mmol/L, all P = 0.000). Among 19 epileptic cases, 16 ceased after treatment. And 14 stayed convulsion-free within 3 months post-treatments, 2 cases had intermittent tonic-clonic seizures while there was 1 case of focal seizures. Fourteen cases withdrew antiepileptic medications or reduced their doses. After treatment, the electroencephalographic results became totally normal in 8 of the 19 epileptic cases. Electroencephalographic results improved in 5 cases versus pre-treatment. Spikes were controlled in 10 cases including 5 patients with hyperarrhythmia in the abnormal electroencephalographic group with epilepsy. Six cases continued abnormal electroencephalogram. In the abnormal electroencephalographic group without epilepsy (n = 15) , electroencephalograms were normal (n = 3), improved (n = 6) and continued mild abnormal waves (n = 2). However, there were 4 cases with deteriorated electroencephalogram and 3 of them showed spikes. DQ (IQ) was evaluated in 16 cases. And variable mental retardation was observed in all of them. After, year treatment, 7 cases were evaluated DQ (IQ), and their results showed improved (57 ± 16 vs 50 ± 16, t = -5.42, P = 0.002). Conclusions: Etiological treatment for HPA patients is important for controlling epilepsy and improving brain function. And electroencephalogram is useful for monitoring brain functions and evaluating treatment outcomes."
24169311,Music education and its effect on intellectual abilities in children: a systematic review,Artur C Jaschke,"Far transfer between music education and other cognitive skills, such as academic achievement, has been widely examined. However, the results of studies within similar cognitive domains are found to be inconclusive or contradictory. These differences can be traced back to the analytical methods used, differences in the forms of music education studied and differences in neural activation during the processing of these tasks. In order to gain a better picture of the relationships involved, a literature survey was performed in leading databases, such as PubMed/MedLine, psychINFO, ScienceDirect, Embase, ERIC, ASSIA and Jstor from January 2001 to January 2013. All studies included, concerned the far transfer from music education to other cognitive skills in children aged 4-13 years as compared with controls. These studies were independently selected and their quality was assessed by two authors. This systematic review shows the need to address methodological and analytical questions in greater detail. There is a general need to unify methods used in music education research. Furthermore, the hypothesis that intellectual skills, such as mathematics, reading, writing and intelligence can be divided into sub-functions, needs to be examined as one approach to the problems considered here. When this has been done, detailed analysis of cognitive transfer from music education to other disciplines should become possible."
24169147,"Effect of methylphenidate on attention in apathetic AD patients in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial",Krista L Lanctôt,"Background: Little is known about the effect of methylphenidate (MPH) on attention in Alzheimer's disease (AD). MPH has shown to improve apathy in AD, and both apathy and attention have been related to dopaminergic function. The goal was to investigate MPH effects on attention in AD and assess the relationship between attention and apathy responses. Methods: MPH (10 mg PO twice daily) or placebo was administered for six weeks in a randomized, double-blind trial in mild-to-moderate AD outpatients with apathy (Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Apathy ≥ 4). Attention was measured with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Digit Span (DS) subtest (DS forward, selective attention) and apathy with the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). A mixed effects linear regression estimated the difference in change from baseline between treatment groups, defined as δ (MPH (DS week 6-DS baseline)) - (placebo (DS week 6-DS baseline)). Results: In 60 patients (37 females, age = 76 ± 8, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) = 20 ± 5, NPI Apathy = 7 ± 2), the change in DS forward (δ = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.06-1.68), p = 0.03) and DS total (δ = 1.01 (95% CI: 0.09-1.93), p = 0.03) favored MPH over placebo. Of 57 completers, 17 patients had improved apathy (≥3.3 points on the AES from baseline to end point) and 40 did not. There were no significant associations between AES and NPI Apathy with DS change scores in the MPH, placebo, AES responder, or non-responder groups. DS scores did not predict apathy response to MPH treatment. Conclusion: These results suggest MPH can improve attention and apathy in AD; however, the effects appear independent in this population."
24166828,"Impaired response inhibition is associated with self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and ADHD in female FMR1 premutation carriers",Claudine M Kraan,"Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 (FMR1) premutation carriers (PM-carriers) have a defective trinucleotide expansion on the FMR1 gene that is associated with continuum of neuropsychological and mental disorders. Currently, little is known about the distinct subcomponents of executive function potentially impaired in female PM-carriers, and there have been no investigations into associations between executive function and incidences of mental disorders. A total of 35 female PM-carriers confirmed by Asuragen triple primed PCR DNA testing and 35 age- and intelligence-matched controls completed tests of executive function (i.e., response inhibition and working memory) and self-reported on social anxiety, depression, and ADHD predominantly inattentive (ADHD-PI) symptoms. Compared to controls, PM-carriers were significantly elevated on self-reported social anxiety and ADHD-PI symptoms. Irrespective of mental symptoms, female PM-carries performed significantly worse than controls on a response inhibition test, and further investigations revealed significant correlations between executive function performance and self-reported symptoms of anxiety, depression and ADHD-PI. Critically, among PM-carriers with good executive function performance, no women exceeded threshold markers for probable caseness of mental disorder. However, rates of probable caseness were elevated in those with average performance (response inhibition: social anxiety: 41.7%; depression: 20%; ADHD: 44.4%; working memory: social anxiety: 27.3%; depression: 9.1%; ADHD: 18.2%) and highly elevated for those with poor executive function performance (response inhibition: social anxiety: 58.3%; depression: 80%; ADHD: 55.6%; working memory: social anxiety: 100%; depression: 50%; ADHD: 83.3%). These data suggest that subtle executive dysfunction may be a useful neuropsychological indicator for a range of mental disorders previously reported in female PM-carriers."
24165919,Relationship between self-reported ADHD symptoms and WAIS-IV performance],J Theiling,"This study has examined the relationship between cognitive functions and self-reported symptoms in ADHD adults. Cognitive functions were investigated with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) in N=113 ADHD adults. The severity of self-reported symptoms was based on a screening questionnaire (ADHS-E). Results indicated only weak correlations between self-reported ADHD symptoms and WAIS-IV performance. The ADHS-E scale ""Emotion & Affect"" accounted for a small but significant variance on most WAIS-IV indices and turned out to be the most important variable to explain performance. The findings suggest that concurrent and discrepant information contribute to a differentiated examination on adult ADHD and that both objective performance diagnostics and self-reports complement each other within the diagnostic process."
24165301,"Decline in older persons' ability to recognize speech in noise: the influence of demographic, health-related, environmental, and cognitive factors",Marieke Pronk,"Objectives: The first aim was to investigate whether the rate of decline in older persons' ability to recognize speech in noise over time differs across age and gender. The second aim was to determine extent demographic, health-related, environmental, and cognitive factors influence the change in speech-in-noise recognition over time. Design: Data covering 3 to 7 years of follow-up (mean: 4.9 years) of a large sample of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam were used (n = 1298; 3025 observations; baseline ages: 57 to 93 years). Hearing ability was measured by a digit triplet speech-in-noise test (SNT) yielding a speech reception threshold in noise (SRTn). Multilevel analyses were used to model the change in SRTn over time. First, interaction terms were used to test differences in rate of decline across subgroups. Second, for each of the following factors the authors determined the influence on the change in SRTn: age, gender, educational level, cardiovascular conditions, information processing speed, fluid intelligence, global cognitive functioning, smoking, and alcohol use. This was done by calculating the percentage change in Btime after adding the particular factor to the model. Results: On average, respondents' SRTn increased (i.e., deteriorated) significantly over time by 0.18 dB signal-to-noise ratio per annum. Rates were accelerated for older ages (Btime = 0.13, 0.14, 0.25, 0.27 for persons who were 57 to 65, 65 to 75, 75 to 85, and 85 to 93 years of age, respectively). Only information processing speed relevantly influenced the change in SRTn over time (17% decrease in Btime). Conclusions: Decline in older persons' speech-in-noise recognition over time accelerated for older ages. Decline in information processing speed explained a moderate proportion of the SRTn decline. This indicates the relevance of declining cognitive abilities in the ability of older persons to recognize speech in noisy environments."
24164409,Interprofessional social and emotional intelligence skills training: study findings and key lessons,Loma Kaye Flowers,"Frequently changing demands in health care systems have focused attention on the need for emotional competence (EC) - social and emotional intelligence skills, to adapt efficiently, responsively and productively. This paper reports on findings from a workshop that introduced practical EC skills to nearly 1000 participants in education, medicine, mental health and substance abuse counseling. The holistic EC presentations were designed to teach concepts and principles providing each participant with the opportunity for individualized learning. Ninety percent of the participants rated these presentations as valuable and useful. Following this positive response, the approach was adapted to train health professionals serving diverse populations. This report shares our experience teaching various professionals and describes preliminarily testing of the adapted EC training program on a small group of health professionals, whose responsibilities included teamwork, program design, teaching clients and patients EC basics to support healthy practices and self-care. Their positive response supports the need for expanded study and further investigation."
24163706,The efficacy of cognitive training programs in children and adolescents: a meta-analysis,Dieter Karch,"Background: Cognitive therapies are intended to improve basic cognitive functions, whatever the cause of the deficiency may be. Children and adolescents with various cognitive deficits are treated with behavioral therapeutic and computer-supported training programs. We here report the first meta-analysis of the efficacy of such programs. Methods: We systematically searched the Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, and ERIC databases to find pertinent publications for a meta-analysis of cognitive training programs that are used in children and adolescents to improve attention, memory, and executive performance (primary goals) as well as behavior/psychopathology, intelligence, and school performance (secondary goals). The mean differences between the treatment and control groups are given here as standard deviation (SD) scores. Results: 1661 potentially relevant publications were found, including 22 studies that were considered in the meta-analysis, 17 of which were randomized controlled trials. The target variables were measured with more than 90 different testing techniques. The overall effects of cognitive training on attention (SD 0.18, 95% CI -0.11-0.47) and executive function (SD 0.17, 95% CI -0.12-0.46) were consistently small. A relatively strong effect was found on memory performance (0.65 SD, 95% [-0.12-1.42), albeit with marked heterogeneity (I (2)= 82%) owing to two studies. The largest effect was found in the area of behavior and psychopathology (SD 0.58, 95% CI 0.31-0.85), but this last figure is derived mainly from studies that lacked an active control group. Conclusion: Cognitive therapies for children and adolescents have generally favorable, but probably nonspecific effects on behavior. On the other hand, the specific effects, however, were weak overall. Therapeutic benefit has been demonstrated only for certain individual types of therapy for specific indications."
24163218,The assessment and course of development of cognitive abilities in the elderly],M Stemmler,"Background: The assessment of the appropriate level of development in children belongs to the standard duties of physicians in the public health system. Due to a steady increase of dementia in Germany the assessment of cognitive abilities of the elderly is becoming more and more the focus of future activities. Such an assessment of cognitive functioning reveals whether the respective person is aging normally or whether the impaired cognitive functioning is probably based on a pathological process. Objective: The aim of the present study is to present cognitive changes in the aged and 2 psychometric tests for the assessment of cognitive functioning: the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) and the Short Cognitive Performance Test (SKT), a test for the assessment of memory impairments and impairment of attention. In addition, similarities and dissimilarities are presented. Methods: As part of a multi-centre study in German-speaking countries the data of 504 cognitively healthy persons between the age of 60 and 90 were tested with the WAIS-IV and the SKT. Results and conclusion: The results revealed a significant cognitive decline in the fluid and crystal intelligence depending on age. Only 2 subtests of the WAIS-IV (General Information and Block Design) showed no significant variation due to age. The SKT scores of memory and attention correlated significantly with almost all subtests of the WAIS-IV. The highest correlations were between the SKT attention score and the WAIS-IV subtests for processing speed, perceptual reasoning and working memory. The decline in cognitive abilities is mainly due to reduced capacities in speed of information processing and working memory."
24163216,The relationships of intelligence and memory assessed using the WAIS-IV and the WMS-IV],A C Lepach,"Background: This study examines the relationships of intelligence and memory scores derived from WAIS-IV and WMS-IV. We were especially interested in the reciprocal predictive values of the test scales. Methods: A sample of 137 healthy adults with an age range between 16 and 69 years was assessed with the WAIS-IV and the WMS-IV. The test order was balanced. Pearson correlations were conducted on the subtest and scale level. A series of 14 linear regression models was tested with memory performance as predictor for intelligence and vice versa. Results and conclusion: A model including the 3 main memory scales of the WMS-IV was able to predict the global IQ best. It nevertheless explained only 46% of the variance. The memory and intelligence measures show significant relationships, but also represent distinct functions. WAIS-IV and WMS-IV complement one another."
24162872,Project DyAdd: implicit learning in adult dyslexia and ADHD,Marja Laasonen,"In this study of the project DyAdd, implicit learning was investigated through two paradigms in adults (18-55 years) with dyslexia (n = 36) or with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, n = 22) and in controls (n = 35). In the serial reaction time (SRT) task, there were no group differences in learning. However, those with ADHD exhibited faster RTs compared to other groups. In the artificial grammar learning (AGL) task, the groups did not differ from each other in their learning (i.e., grammaticality accuracy or similarity choices). Further, all three groups were sensitive to fragment overlap between learning and test-phase items (i.e., similarity choices were above chance). Grammaticality performance of control participants was above chance, but that of participants with dyslexia and participants with ADHD failed to differ from chance, indicating impaired grammaticality learning in these groups. While the main indices of AGL performance, grammaticality accuracy and similarity choices did not correlate with the neuropsychological variables that reflected dyslexia-related (phonological processing, reading, spelling, arithmetic) or ADHD-related characteristics (executive functions, attention), or intelligence, the explicit knowledge for the AGL grammar (i.e., ability to freely generate grammatical strings) correlated positively with the variables of phonological processing and reading. Further, SRT reaction times correlated positively with full scale intelligence quotient (FIQ). We conclude that, in AGL, learning difficulties of the underlying rule structure (as measured by grammaticality) are associated with dyslexia and ADHD. However, learning in AGL is not related to the defining neuropsychological features of dyslexia or ADHD. Instead, the resulting explicit knowledge relates to characteristics of dyslexia."
24161221,Motor outcomes in children exposed to early psychosocial deprivation,April R Levin,"Objectives: To determine the effect of psychosocial deprivation early in life on motor development, assess the impact of a foster care intervention on improving motor development, and assess the association between motor and cognitive outcomes in children with a history of institutional care. Study design: In a randomized controlled trial, children living in Romanian institutions were randomly assigned to care as usual in the institution or placed in family-centered foster care as part of the Bucharest Early Intervention Project. The average age at placement into foster care was 23 months. At age 8 years, the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Second Edition, Short Form (BOT2-SF) was applied to assess the motor proficiency of children in both groups, as well as a never-institutionalized group from the Romanian community. Results: Children in the never-institutionalized group did significantly better on the BOT2-SF than children who had ever been institutionalized (P < .001). There was no significant difference in performance between children in the care as usual group and the foster care group. This finding also held true for all individual items on the BOT2-SF except sit-ups. Regression analyses revealed that the between-group and within-group differences in BOT2-SF scores were largely mediated by IQ. Conclusion: Early deprivation had a negative effect on motor development that was not resolved by placement in foster care. This effect was predominantly mediated by IQ. This study highlights the importance of monitoring for and addressing motor delays in children with a history of institutionalization, particularly those children with low IQ."
24159559,Epidemic intelligence service officers and field epidemiology training program in Korea,Geun-Yong Kwon,"Korea has adopted Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) officers through the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) since 1999 for systematic control of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Graduates of medical schools in Korea are selected and serve as public health doctors (PHDs) for their mandatory military service. The duration of service is 3 years and PHDs comprise general practitioners and specialists. Some PHDs are selected as EIS officers with 3 weeks basic FETP training and work for central and provincial public health authorities to conduct epidemiological investigations. The total number of EIS officers is 31 as of 2012. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has 12 specialists, whereas specialists and each province has one or two EIS officers to administer local epidemiological investigations in 253 public health centers. The Korean EIS officers have successfully responded and prevented infectious diseases, but there is a unique limitation: the number of PHDs in Korea is decreasing and PHDs are not allowed to stay outside Korea, which makes it difficult to cope with overseas infectious diseases. Furthermore, after 3 years service, they quit and their experiences are not accumulated. KCDC has hired full-time EIS officers since 2012 to overcome this limitation."
24158389,Osseous and soft tissue operations for treatment of joint malpositioning in infantile cerebral palsy],S Senst,"If untreated infantile cerebral palsy (ICP) leads to a progressive shortening of muscles and to progressive joint malpositioning. In addition a number of other disorders also result, in particular sensory disorders, intelligence deficits and epilepsy. In order to optimally treat as many as possible of the problems of multi-handicapped children with ICP it is of immanent importance that physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, orthopedic technicians, pediatric orthopedists as well as neuropediatricians and social pediatricians work as a team. Surgical measures to correct joint malpositioning serve to improve the function and also to avoid or alleviate pain. Functional improvement measures are ideally undertaken during or shortly before elementary school age, thus enabling a further verticalization/straightening and mobilization. To improve symmetry and therefore the sitting posture, surgery is also indicated for profoundly disabled patients, sometimes making foot operations necessary. It is only in this way that maximum participation can be guaranteed and if necessary utilizing additional aids, such as Zimmer frames or E-wheelchairs."
24158106,"Clinical, psychosocial, and central correlates of quality of life in myotonic dystrophy type 1 patients",Luc Laberge,"Aims: To identify sociodemographic, clinical, and central correlates of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in DM1 patients. Methods: 200 DM1 patients had assessments of muscular impairment, CTG repeats, and intelligence. Validated instruments were used to assess sociodemographic and clinical factors as well as social support, social participation, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, personality, mood, and quality of life. Regression analysis was used to identify correlates of SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores. Results: Patients scored lower on all SF-36 physical health subscales compared with normative data but did not differ with respect to mental health function. Regression analysis revealed that psychological distress, fatigue, severe muscular impairment, emotional stability, not having worked within the last 12 months, and lower intellectual quotient were associated with lower scores in physical health function. Moreover, neuroticism, daytime sleepiness, dissatisfaction with social participation, and lower conscientiousness were associated with lower scores in mental health function. Conclusion: DM1 has an impact on SF-36 physical summary scores but not on mental summary scores. Factors such as fatigue, daytime sleepiness, psychological distress, unemployment, and social participation dissatisfaction that significantly affect HRQoL in DM1 are amenable to treatment and psychosocial interventions, namely by providing care that integrate health, social, and community services."
24155980,Inflexible minds: impaired attention switching in recent-onset schizophrenia,Henderikus G O M Smid,"Impairment of sustained attention is assumed to be a core cognitive abnormality in schizophrenia. However, this seems inconsistent with a recent hypothesis that in schizophrenia the implementation of selection (i.e., sustained attention) is intact but the control of selection (i.e., switching the focus of attention) is impaired. Mounting evidence supports this hypothesis, indicating that switching of attention is a bigger problem in schizophrenia than maintaining the focus of attention. To shed more light on this hypothesis, we tested whether schizophrenia patients are impaired relative to controls in sustaining attention, switching attention, or both. Fifteen patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and fifteen healthy volunteers, matched on age and intelligence, performed sustained attention and attention switching tasks, while performance and brain potential measures of selective attention were recorded. In the sustained attention task, patients did not differ from the controls on these measures. In the attention switching task, however, patients showed worse performance than the controls, and early selective attention related brain potentials were absent in the patients while clearly present in the controls. These findings support the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with an impairment of the mechanisms that control the direction of attention (attention switching), while the mechanisms that implement a direction of attention (sustained attention) are intact."
24154896,Clinical outcomes of mild isolated cerebral ventriculomegaly in the presence of other neurodevelopmental risk factors,John D Ball,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate neuropsychological test data in school-aged children whose fetal sonograms revealed mild isolated cerebral ventriculomegaly without asymmetry of the lateral ventricles. Methods: Nine of 52 children 6 years and older with sonographic evidence of mild isolated cerebral ventriculomegaly without asymmetry of the lateral ventricles were able to be recruited for follow-up school-aged neuropsychological testing. The children received a half-day battery of neuropsychological tests, including the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence; Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration, Fifth Edition; Wide Range Achievement Test, Fourth Edition; and Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test. Parents completed the Conners 3 Parent Short Form and the Personality Inventory for Children, Second Edition. Results: In this small group, other risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders were often present, including preterm birth, perinatal hypoxia, and a family history of psychiatric disease or substance abuse. Within this sample, the proportion of children with a pattern of test results showing poorer nonverbal intelligence than verbal intelligence scores and poorer math than reading performance, as well as meeting criteria for a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, was higher than the basal rates of these problems among children in general. Conclusions: Particularly given the complexity of various factors affecting neurodevelopment, follow-up neuropsychological evaluation is warranted in children with sonographic evidence of mild isolated cerebral ventriculomegaly without asymmetry of the lateral ventricle (eg, in the context of poor school performance)."
24153402,Test Anxiety Among College Students With Specific Reading Disability (Dyslexia): Nonverbal Ability and Working Memory as Predictors,Jason M Nelson,"Test anxiety and its correlates were examined with college students with and without specific reading disability (RD; n = 50 in each group). Results indicated that college students with RD reported higher test anxiety than did those without RD, and the magnitude of these differences was in the medium range on two test anxiety scales. Relative to college students without RD, up to 5 times as many college students with RD reported clinically significant test anxiety. College students with RD reported significantly higher cognitively based test anxiety than physically based test anxiety. Reading skills, verbal ability, and processing speed were not correlated with test anxiety. General intelligence, nonverbal ability, and working memory were negatively correlated with test anxiety, and the magnitude of these correlations was medium to large. When these three cognitive constructs were considered together in multiple regression analyses, only working memory and nonverbal ability emerged as significant predictors and varied based on the test anxiety measure. Implications for assessment and intervention are discussed."
24152965,"Biosurveillance enterprise for operational awareness, a genomic-based approach for tracking pathogen virulence",Willy A Valdivia-Granda,"To protect our civilians and warfighters against both known and unknown pathogens, biodefense stakeholders must be able to foresee possible technological trends that could affect their threat risk assessment. However, significant flaws in how we prioritize our countermeasure-needs continue to limit their development. As recombinant biotechnology becomes increasingly simplified and inexpensive, small groups, and even individuals, can now achieve the design, synthesis, and production of pathogenic organisms for offensive purposes. Under these daunting circumstances, a reliable biosurveillance approach that supports a diversity of users could better provide early warnings about the emergence of new pathogens (both natural and manmade), reverse engineer pathogens carrying traits to avoid available countermeasures, and suggest the most appropriate detection, prophylactic, and therapeutic solutions. While impressive in data mining capabilities, real-time content analysis of social media data misses much of the complexity in the factual reality. Quality issues within freeform user-provided hashtags and biased referencing can significantly undermine our confidence in the information obtained to make critical decisions about the natural vs. intentional emergence of a pathogen. At the same time, errors in pathogen genomic records, the narrow scope of most databases, and the lack of standards and interoperability across different detection and diagnostic devices, continue to restrict the multidimensional biothreat assessment. The fragmentation of our biosurveillance efforts into different approaches has stultified attempts to implement any new foundational enterprise that is more reliable, more realistic and that avoids the scenario of the warning that comes too late. This discussion focus on the development of genomic-based decentralized medical intelligence and laboratory system to track emerging and novel microbial health threats in both military and civilian settings and the use of virulence factors for risk assessment. Examples of the use of motif fingerprints for pathogen discrimination are provided."
24151530,Musicality Correlates With Sociability and Emotionality in Williams Syndrome,Rowena Ng,"Williams Syndrome (WS) is a neurogenetic developmental disorder characterized by peaks and valleys of cognitive abilities. One peak that has been understudied is the affinity that many individuals with WS have toward music. It remains unknown whether their high levels of musical interest, skill and expressivity are related to their sociable personality or their verbal intelligence. We examined the relationships between musicality (musical interest, creativity and expressivity), sociability (social-emotionality, social approach) and language comprehension in WS and typically developing (TD) controls. Findings suggest that emotion-expressivity through music in WS may be linked to their sensitivity and responsivity to emotions of others, whereas general interest in music may be related to greater linguistic capacity in TD individuals. Musicality and sociability may be more closely related in WS relative than in typical development; implications for future interventions for this neurodevelopmental condition will be discussed."
24151499,New insights into the genetic mechanism of IQ in autism spectrum disorders,Harold Z Wang,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) comprise a number of underlying sub-types with various symptoms and presumably different genetic causes. One important difference between these sub-phenotypes is IQ. Some forms of ASD such as Asperger's have relatively intact intelligence while the majority does not. In this study, we explored the role of genetic factors that might account for this difference. Using a case-control study based on IQ status in 1657 ASD probands, we analyzed both common and rare variants provided by the Autism Genome Project (AGP) consortium via dbGaP (database of Genotypes and Phenotypes). We identified a set of genes, among them HLA-DRB1 and KIAA0319L, which are strongly associated with IQ within a population of ASD patients."
24149722,Artificial intelligence in sports on the example of weight training,Hristo Novatchkov,"The overall goal of the present study was to illustrate the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in sports on the example of weight training. The research focused in particular on the implementation of pattern recognition methods for the evaluation of performed exercises on training machines. The data acquisition was carried out using way and cable force sensors attached to various weight machines, thereby enabling the measurement of essential displacement and force determinants during training. On the basis of the gathered data, it was consequently possible to deduce other significant characteristics like time periods or movement velocities. These parameters were applied for the development of intelligent methods adapted from conventional machine learning concepts, allowing an automatic assessment of the exercise technique and providing individuals with appropriate feedback. In practice, the implementation of such techniques could be crucial for the investigation of the quality of the execution, the assistance of athletes but also coaches, the training optimization and for prevention purposes. For the current study, the data was based on measurements from 15 rather inexperienced participants, performing 3-5 sets of 10-12 repetitions on a leg press machine. The initially preprocessed data was used for the extraction of significant features, on which supervised modeling methods were applied. Professional trainers were involved in the assessment and classification processes by analyzing the video recorded executions. The so far obtained modeling results showed good performance and prediction outcomes, indicating the feasibility and potency of AI techniques in assessing performances on weight training equipment automatically and providing sportsmen with prompt advice. Key pointsArtificial intelligence is a promising field for sport-related analysis.Implementations integrating pattern recognition techniques enable the automatic evaluation of data measurements.Artificial neural networks applied for the analysis of weight training data show good performance and high classification rates."
24148814,Open-Phylo: a customizable crowd-computing platform for multiple sequence alignment,Daniel Kwak,"Citizen science games such as Galaxy Zoo, Foldit, and Phylo aim to harness the intelligence and processing power generated by crowds of online gamers to solve scientific problems. However, the selection of the data to be analyzed through these games is under the exclusive control of the game designers, and so are the results produced by gamers. Here, we introduce Open-Phylo, a freely accessible crowd-computing platform that enables any scientist to enter our system and use crowds of gamers to assist computer programs in solving one of the most fundamental problems in genomics: the multiple sequence alignment problem."
24148222,3-M syndrome: a growth disorder associated with IGF2 silencing,P G Murray,"3-M syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by pre- and post-natal growth restriction, facial dysmorphism, normal intelligence and radiological features (slender long bones and tall vertebral bodies). It is known to be caused by mutations in the genes encoding cullin 7, obscurin-like 1 and coiled-coil domain containing 8. The mechanisms through which mutations in these genes impair growth are unclear. The aim of this study was to identify novel pathways involved in the growth impairment in 3-M syndrome. RNA was extracted from fibroblast cell lines derived from four 3-M syndrome patients and three control subjects, hybridised to Affymetrix HU 133 plus 2.0 arrays with quantitative real-time PCR used to confirm changes found on microarray. IGF-II protein levels in conditioned cell culture media were measured by ELISA. Of the top 10 downregulated probesets, three represented IGF2 while H19 was identified as the 23rd most upregulated probeset. QRT-PCR confirmed upregulation of H19 (P<0.001) and downregulation of IGF2 (P<0.001). Levels of IGF-II secreted into conditioned cell culture medium were higher for control fibroblasts than those for 3-M fibroblasts (10.2±2.9 vs 0.6±0.9 ng/ml, P<0.01). 3-M syndrome is associated with a gene expression profile of reduced IGF2 expression and increased H19 expression similar to that found in Silver-Russell syndrome. Loss of autocrine IGF-II in the growth plate may be associated with the short stature seen in children with 3-M syndrome."
24145427,Number sense in infancy predicts mathematical abilities in childhood,Ariel Starr,"Human infants in the first year of life possess an intuitive sense of number. This preverbal number sense may serve as a developmental building block for the uniquely human capacity for mathematics. In support of this idea, several studies have demonstrated that nonverbal number sense is correlated with mathematical abilities in children and adults. However, there has been no direct evidence that infant numerical abilities are related to mathematical abilities later in childhood. Here, we provide evidence that preverbal number sense in infancy predicts mathematical abilities in preschool-aged children. Numerical preference scores at 6 months of age correlated with both standardized math test scores and nonsymbolic number comparison scores at 3.5 years of age, suggesting that preverbal number sense facilitates the acquisition of numerical symbols and mathematical abilities. This relationship held even after controlling for general intelligence, indicating that preverbal number sense imparts a unique contribution to mathematical ability. These results validate the many prior studies purporting to show number sense in infancy and support the hypothesis that mathematics is built upon an intuitive sense of number that predates language."
24145296,Mental contrasting and transfer of energization,A Timur Sevincer,"Mental contrasting a desired future with present reality is a self-regulation strategy that fosters energization in line with a person's expectations of successfully attaining the desired future. We investigated whether physiological energization (measured by systolic blood pressure) elicited by mental contrasting a desired future of solving a given task transfers to effort in an unrelated task. As predicted, mental contrasting a desired future of excelling in an intelligence test (Study 1) and of writing an excellent essay (Study 2) triggered changes in energization that translated into physical effort in squeezing a handgrip (Study 1) and translated into mental effort in writing a get-well letter (Study 2). Results suggest that mental contrasting of solving one task triggers energization that may fuel effort for performing an unrelated task. Implications for intervention research are discussed."
24144107,Executive dysfunction is related with decreased frontal lobe blood flow in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage,Ken Uchikawa,"Objective: This study evaluated executive dysfunction in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) using the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS) and correlated the occurrence of executive dysfunction with cerebral blood flow (CBF) reduction in the frontal lobe as assessed by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Design: Correlational study. Subjects: Twenty-two patients who underwent microsurgical clipping at least 3 months after SAH. Methods: This study evaluated the BADS and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III). In addition, it assessed activities of daily living (ADL). CBF was evaluated using SPECT. The patients were divided into the following groups according to the results of SPECT: (1) those with reduced CBF in the frontal lobe (reduced CBF group, n = 8) and (2) those with intact CBF (intact CBF group, n = 14). Results: The BADS score was significantly lower in the reduced CBF group compared with that of the intact CBF group, while there was no significant difference in the WAIS-III scores and ADL scale between the two groups. Conclusion: Although this result was conducted with a small sample size, executive dysfunction correlates with reduced CBF in the frontal lobes of SAH patients. A detailed evaluation of executive function is suggested in SAH patients, even if the patient's intelligence test and ADL scale reveal no abnormalities."
24142289,Cold-minded thinking? The role of emotional intelligence and emotional stability in Machiavellian decision-making],Linda Szíjjártó,"Previous studies clearly show that Machiavellians' thinking and behavior are characterized by some kind of cold attitude, a tendency to be detached from the emotional features of a particular situation. However, very little is known what this cold-minded attitude means, and the presence or the absence of what abilities can lead to emotional detachment. Surprisingly, our study has shown that Machiavellians - contrary to what others believe - happen to exhibit more emotional instability than others. They experience more negative emotions, lose their peace of mind faster, and have a hard time tolerating psychological distress. However, they try to conceal their emotional worries in two different ways. On the one hand, they cannot express their emotions as subtly and precisely as others, and on the other, they are much worse at identifying and differentiating their own emotional states. Maybe it is just the deficit in evaluating and expressing emotions that enables them to implement the strategy to enforce their self-interest successfully. The weak ability to identify and comprehend their own emotions may help them stay detached from the emotional temperature of a situation, while the difficulties in expressing their emotions enable them to disguise their true intentions from their partners."
24141795,Human opinion dynamics: an inspiration to solve complex optimization problems,Rishemjit Kaur,"Human interactions give rise to the formation of different kinds of opinions in a society. The study of formations and dynamics of opinions has been one of the most important areas in social physics. The opinion dynamics and associated social structure leads to decision making or so called opinion consensus. Opinion formation is a process of collective intelligence evolving from the integrative tendencies of social influence with the disintegrative effects of individualisation, and therefore could be exploited for developing search strategies. Here, we demonstrate that human opinion dynamics can be utilised to solve complex mathematical optimization problems. The results have been compared with a standard algorithm inspired from bird flocking behaviour and the comparison proves the efficacy of the proposed approach in general. Our investigation may open new avenues towards understanding the collective decision making."
24141457,Parents` knowledge and attitudes toward children with epilepsy,Lama E Zainy,"Objective: To study parents` knowledge and attitude towards children with epilepsy, and to identify contributing factors to negative attitudes. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study including consecutive parents attending the pediatric neurology clinics of King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from February to August 2012. A structured 40-item questionnaire was designed to examine their demographics, knowledge, and attitudes. Results: A total of 117 parents were interviewed, 57% were mothers. The ages of their epileptic children ranged from 1-16 years (median 6.6), mostly boys (65%). Although most parents (70%) felt informed and recognized various treatment modalities, many believed that epilepsy is a mental disorder (48%), correlates with evil (44%), or affects the child`s intelligence (38%). Up to 53% admitted to treating their child differently and avoiding upsetting or punishing him/her. This behavior was less likely if they achieved college education (p=0.01). Some parents (29%) admitted to using non-medical treatments, usually traditional or religious practices. Those parents were more likely to believe that epilepsy is a mental disease (p=0.002), or correlates with evil (p=0.015). Conclusion: The level of knowledge among parents of epileptic children needs improvement. Many have significant misconceptions, negative attitudes, and poor parenting practices. Increased awareness and educational programs are needed to improve the quality of life of these families."
24141034,Goal neglect and knowledge chunking in the construction of novel behaviour,Apoorva Bhandari,"Task complexity is critical in cognitive efficiency and fluid intelligence. To examine functional limits in task complexity, we examine the phenomenon of goal neglect, where participants with low fluid intelligence fail to follow task rules that they otherwise understand. Though neglect is known to increase with task complexity, here we show that - in contrast to previous accounts - the critical factor is not the total complexity of all task rules. Instead, when the space of task requirements can be divided into separate sub-parts, neglect is controlled by the complexity of each component part. The data also show that neglect develops and stabilizes over the first few performance trials, i.e. as instructions are first used to generate behaviour. In all complex behaviour, a critical process is combination of task events with retrieved task requirements to create focused attentional episodes dealing with each decision in turn. In large part, we suggest, fluid intelligence may reflect this process of converting complex requirements into effective attentional episodes."
24140960,The effect of sleep in perceptual learning with complex objects,Annelies Baeck,"Recognition of objects improves with training, but task performance also improves between sessions without further training. This offline learning seems to be influenced by post-training sleep, as is evidenced in perceptual learning studies with simple stimuli. In this study we aim to investigate the role of sleep in perceptual learning with complex natural and man-made objects. Participants were trained with a backward masking task during four sessions with 12h between each training session (morning-evening-morning-evening or evening-morning-evening-morning). A larger improvement on performance was found after a night's sleep, than when subjects performed the task without having slept between training sessions. This effect was not influenced by the participants' chronotype or non-verbal intelligence. In addition, we replicated some key characteristics of perceptual learning with complex objects. Participants were retested six days after the last training session with the previously trained stimulus and new stimuli. The performance gains were long-lasting and specific to the trained stimulus set."
24140776,A case of thrombosed giant aneurysm of the azygos anterior cerebral artery: clipping under monitoring of motor evoked potentials of the lower extremities,Hiroshi Yoneda,"Giant aneurysms of the distal anterior cerebral artery (ACA), especially the azygos ACA, are rare. We treated a patient with giant aneurysm of the azygos ACA who underwent aspiration of thrombus and clipping under monitoring of motor evoked potentials of the lower extremities (L-MEPs), resulting in remarkable recovery of motor and intellectual function. A 72-year-old male was admitted with left motor weakness persisting for 2 weeks. Neurologically, disorientation and intellectual impairment were also noted. Imaging disclosed a 60-mm diameter aneurysm with heterochronous thrombi arising from the distal bifurcation of the azygos ACA. One month after the onset, radical surgery was scheduled. The azygos ACA was secured and the aneurysm was dissected, and the distal parts of the azygos ACA were confirmed. After removal of the thrombus, the neck was reconstructed with eight clips. L-MEPs disappeared due to occlusion of the azygos ACA for 20 minutes but reappeared after 22 minutes and normalized 78 minutes after reperfusion. Motor weakness improved entirely with mini-mental state examination score of 29 points at 1 month after surgery. One year later, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised scores reached normal levels. Review of reported cases found this aneurysm tends to occur in males in their 50s to 70s presenting with mass sign. Decompression of the aneurysm in the frontal lobe and monitoring of L-MEPs during temporary occlusion of the ACA are important."
24138948,Corticosteroid therapy for duchenne muscular dystrophy: improvement of psychomotor function,Yuko Sato,"Background: Of the numerous clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, only the corticosteroid prednisolone has shown potential for temporal improvement in motor ability. In this study, the effects of prednisolone on intellectual ability are examined in 29 cases of Duchenne muscular dystrophy because little information has been reported. And also, motor functions and cardiac functions were evaluated. Methods: The treated group was administered prednisolone (0.75 mg/kg) orally on alternate days and the compared with the untreated control group. Gene mutations were investigated. The patients were examined for intelligence quotient adequate for age, brain natriuretic peptide, creatine kinase, and manual muscle testing before treatment and after the period 6 months to 2 years. Results: Intelligence quotient scores of the treated increased to 6.5 ± 11.9 (mean ± standard deviation) were compared with the controls 2.1 ± 4.9 (P = 0.009). Intelligence quotient scores of the patients with nonsense point mutations improved significantly (21.0 ± 7.9) more than those with deletion or duplication (1.9 ± 9.0; P = 0.015). Motor function, such as time to stand up, of those treated improved significantly and brain natriuretic peptide level was reduced to a normal level after treatment in 15 patients (73%). Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of prednisolone in improving intellectual impairment as well as in preserving motor function and brain natriuretic peptide levels. We presume that prednisolone has a read-through effect on the stop codons in the central nervous systems of Duchenne muscular dystrophy because intelligence quotient of point mutation case was improved significantly."
24136999,RiceWiki: a wiki-based database for community curation of rice genes,Zhang Zhang,"Rice is the most important staple food for a large part of the world's human population and also a key model organism for biological studies of crops as well as other related plants. Here we present RiceWiki (http://ricewiki.big.ac.cn), a wiki-based, publicly editable and open-content platform for community curation of rice genes. Most existing related biological databases are based on expert curation; with the exponentially exploding volume of rice knowledge and other relevant data, however, expert curation becomes increasingly laborious and time-consuming to keep knowledge up-to-date, accurate and comprehensive, struggling with the flood of data and requiring a large number of people getting involved in rice knowledge curation. Unlike extant relevant databases, RiceWiki features harnessing collective intelligence in community curation of rice genes, quantifying users' contributions in each curated gene and providing explicit authorship for each contributor in any given gene, with the aim to exploit the full potential of the scientific community for rice knowledge curation. Based on community curation, RiceWiki bears the potential to make it possible to build a rice encyclopedia by and for the scientific community that harnesses community intelligence for collaborative knowledge curation, covers all aspects of biological knowledge and keeps evolving with novel knowledge."
24135475,The people's mentality confronting plague in the Ming Dynasty],Xu Chen,"The social influence of plague was not only confined to its pathogenicity, but also its close relationship with the people's mentality. According to the historical materials of the Ming Dynasty, there were 2 kinds of mentalities when confronting with the prevalence of plague: negative and positive. The former included fear, helplessness, depression and superstition etc., and the latter included intelligence, consolation, thanksgiving and vigour etc. The negative passive mentality didn't help to fight effectively against the plague, or might even aggravate its prevalence. However, the positive mentality helped ameliorate and control the plague, and also the rehabilitation of the order of production and living order after the plague."
24134790,Neurobehavioural correlates in older children and adolescents with obesity and obstructive sleep apnoea,Evan Tan,"Aim: The relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and poorer neurobehavioural outcomes in school-age children is well established, but the relationship in obese children and adolescents, in whom OSA is more common, is not so well established. We aimed to investigate this relationship in 10-18-year-olds. Methods: Thirty-one participants with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 32.3 ± 4.9 enrolled. BMI-for-age cut-offs were used to define obesity. Participants underwent polysomnography and were classified into OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) > 2 per hour) and non-OSA (AHI ≤ 2) groups. Intelligence, memory and learning, academic achievement, behaviour and executive functioning were assessed using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning 2, Wechsler Individual Achievement Test II (WIAT-II), Behavioural Assessment System for Children 2 and Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function, respectively. Results: Forty-eight per cent (15/31) were classified as having OSA, and 52% (16/31) as non-OSA. The obese cohort performed below the average of normative data on several neurobehavioural measures. WIAT-II maths scores were significantly lower (P = 0.034) in the OSA group than in the non-OSA group (means 84.5 vs. 94.6, respectively), losing significance after adjustment for IQ, age and gender. Self-reported school problems were significantly worse in the OSA group before and after multivariate adjustment (P = 0.010, Cohen's d = 1.02). No other significant differences were found. Conclusions: Results suggest that OSA may increase risk for some poorer educational and behavioural outcomes. The findings are reasonably consistent with and add to the evidence base of the few studies that have explored this relationship."
24133476,On the interrelation of multiplication and division in secondary school children,Stefan Huber,"Each division problem can be transformed into as a multiplication problem and vice versa. Recent research has indicated strong developmental parallels between multiplication and division in primary school children. In this study, we were interested in (i) whether these developmental parallels persist into secondary school, (ii) whether similar developmental parallels can be observed for simple and complex problems, (iii) whether skill level modulates this relationship, and (iv) whether the correlations are specific and not driven by general cognitive or arithmetic abilities. Therefore, we assessed performance of 5th and 6th graders attending two secondary school types of the German educational system in simple and complex multiplication as well as division while controlling for non-verbal intelligence, short-term memory, and other arithmetic abilities. Accordingly, we collected data from students differing in skills levels due to either age (5th < 6th grade) or school type (general < intermediate secondary school). We observed moderate to strong bivariate and partial correlations between multiplication and division with correlations being higher for simple tasks but nevertheless reliable for complex tasks. Moreover, the association between simple multiplication and division depended on students' skill levels as reflected by school types, but not by age. Partial correlations were higher for intermediate than for general secondary school children. In sum, these findings emphasize the importance of the inverse relationship between multiplication and division which persists into later developmental stages. However, evidence for skill-related differences in the relationship between multiplication and division was restricted to the differences for school types."
24133465,Environmental influences on neural systems of relational complexity,M Layne Kalbfleisch,"Constructivist learning theory contends that we construct knowledge by experience and that environmental context influences learning. To explore this principle, we examined the cognitive process relational complexity (RC), defined as the number of visual dimensions considered during problem solving on a matrix reasoning task and a well-documented measure of mature reasoning capacity. We sought to determine how the visual environment influences RC by examining the influence of color and visual contrast on RC in a neuroimaging task. To specify the contributions of sensory demand and relational integration to reasoning, our participants performed a non-verbal matrix task comprised of color, no-color line, or black-white visual contrast conditions parametrically varied by complexity (relations 0, 1, 2). The use of matrix reasoning is ecologically valid for its psychometric relevance and for its potential to link the processing of psychophysically specific visual properties with various levels of RC during reasoning. The role of these elements is important because matrix tests assess intellectual aptitude based on these seemingly context-less exercises. This experiment is a first step toward examining the psychophysical underpinnings of performance on these types of problems. The importance of this is increased in light of recent evidence that intelligence can be linked to visual discrimination. We submit three main findings. First, color and black-white visual contrast (BWVC) add demand at a basic sensory level, but contributions from color and from BWVC are dissociable in cortex such that color engages a ""reasoning heuristic"" and BWVC engages a ""sensory heuristic."" Second, color supports contextual sense-making by boosting salience resulting in faster problem solving. Lastly, when visual complexity reaches 2-relations, color and visual contrast relinquish salience to other dimensions of problem solving."
24131840,"Effects of sleep deprivation on the intelligence structure of school-age children in Changsha, China]",Xiang-Yu Wang,"Objective: To investigate the effects of sleep deprivation on intelligence development in primary school students. Methods: Between June 2009 and April 2010, 316 grade 5 students aged 10-11 years were selected from four primary schools in four administrative districts of Changsha, China by stratified random sampling. The intelligence characteristics of children with varying degrees of sleep deprivation were investigated using the Chinese Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Results: A total of 286 valid questionnaires were received, with a response rate of 90.5%. The survey was comprised of a sleep deprivation group (sleep time <8 hours per night; n=180) and a control group (sleep time ≥8 hours per night; n=106). The sleep deprivation group had significantly lower subtest scores, verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ) and full scale IQ (P<0.05) and significantly lower verbal comprehension factor score and memory/attention factor score compared with the control group (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the moderate sleep deprivation subgroup had significantly decreased VIQ and full scale IQ as well as verbal comprehension factor score and memory/attention factor score (P<0.05), and the severe sleep deprivation subgroup showed decreases in all scores (P<0.05). The sleep deprivation group and moderate and severe sleep deprivation subgroups had significantly higher proportions of children with VIQ-PIQ imbalance than the control group. Conclusions: Sleep deprivation adversely affects intelligence development, especially VIQ, in primary school students, and the adverse effects of sleep deprivation are mainly seen in students with moderate and severe sleep deprivation."
24131614,Economic burden of cancer across the European Union: a population-based cost analysis,Ramon Luengo-Fernandez,"Background: In 2008, 2·45 million people were diagnosed with cancer and 1·23 million died because of cancer in the 27 countries of the European Union (EU). We aimed to estimate the economic burden of cancer in the EU. Methods: In a population-based cost analysis, we evaluated the cost of all cancers and also those associated with breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers. We obtained country-specific aggregate data for morbidity, mortality, and health-care resource use from international and national sources. We estimated health-care costs from expenditure on care in the primary, outpatient, emergency, and inpatient settings, and also drugs. Additionally, we estimated the costs of unpaid care provided by relatives or friends of patients (ie, informal care), lost earnings after premature death, and costs associated with individuals who temporarily or permanently left employment because of illness. Findings: Cancer cost the EU €126 billion in 2009, with health care accounting for €51·0 billion (40%). Across the EU, the health-care costs of cancer were equivalent to €102 per citizen, but varied substantially from €16 per person in Bulgaria to €184 per person in Luxembourg. Productivity losses because of early death cost €42·6 billion and lost working days €9·43 billion. Informal care cost €23·2 billion. Lung cancer had the highest economic cost (€18·8 billion, 15% of overall cancer costs), followed by breast cancer (€15·0 billion, 12%), colorectal cancer (€13·1 billion, 10%), and prostate cancer (€8·43 billion, 7%). Interpretation: Our results show wide differences between countries, the reasons for which need further investigation. These data contribute to public health and policy intelligence, which is required to deliver affordable cancer care systems and inform effective public research funds allocation."
24130887,Contribution of brain size to IQ and educational underperformance in extremely preterm adolescents,Jeanie L Y Cheong,"Objectives: Extremely preterm (EP) survivors have smaller brains, lower IQ, and worse educational achievement than their term-born peers. The contribution of smaller brain size to the IQ and educational disadvantages of EP is unknown. This study aimed (i) to compare brain volumes from multiple brain tissues and structures between EP-born (< 28 weeks) and term-born (≥ 37 weeks) control adolescents, (ii) to explore the relationships of brain tissue volumes with IQ and basic educational skills and whether this differed by group, and (iii) to explore how much total brain tissue volume explains the underperformance of EP adolescents compared with controls. Methods: Longitudinal cohort study of 148 EP and 132 term controls born in Victoria, Australia in 1991-92. At age 18, magnetic resonance imaging-determined brain volumes of multiple tissues and structures were calculated. IQ and educational skills were measured using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) and the Wide Range Achievement Test(WRAT-4), respectively. Results: Brain volumes were smaller in EP adolescents compared with controls (mean difference [95% confidence interval] of -5.9% [-8.0, -3.7%] for total brain tissue volume). The largest relative differences were noted in the thalamus and hippocampus. The EP group had lower IQs(-11.9 [-15.4, -8.5]), spelling(-8.0 [-11.5, -4.6]), math computation(-10.3 [-13.7, -6.9]) and word reading(-5.6 [-8.8, -2.4]) scores than controls; all p-values<0.001. Volumes of total brain tissue and other brain tissues and structures correlated positively with IQ and educational skills, a relationship that was similar for both the EP and controls. Total brain tissue volume explained between 20-40% of the IQ and educational outcome differences between EP and controls. Conclusions: EP adolescents had smaller brain volumes, lower IQs and poorer educational performance than controls. Brain volumes of multiple tissues and structures are related to IQ and educational outcomes. Smaller total brain tissue volume is an important contributor to the cognitive and educational underperformance of adolescents born EP."
24130858,"The association between intelligence scores and family history of psychiatric disorder in schizophrenia patients, their siblings and healthy controls",Kim H W Verweij,"Background: The degree of intellectual impairment in schizophrenia patients and their relatives has been suggested to be associated with the degree of familial loading for schizophrenia. Since other psychiatric disorders are also more present in relatives of schizophrenia patients, the definition of family history should be broadened. The association between family history for psychiatric disorder and intelligence scores was investigated in patients with non-affective psychosis, their unaffected siblings and controls. Methods: A sample of 712 schizophrenia proband families (696 patients and 766 siblings) and 427 healthy control families (517 subjects) participated in this study. Family history of psychiatric disorder was determined while excluding the data of the participating schizophrenia patient. A dichotomous division was made between families with no first- or second degree relative with psychiatric disorder and families with one or more affected relatives. Total intelligence scores were estimated by admission of the short form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III. Results: A significant interaction was found between family history of psychiatric disorder and clinical status (F(2,1086.87)= 4.17; p=.016). Patients with a positive family history of psychiatric disorder obtained higher intelligence scores compared to patients with no family history (mean IQ scores are 95.52 and 92.72) with an opposite effect in controls (mean IQ scores are 108.71 and 111.19). No significant difference was found between siblings of schizophrenia patients with or without a positive family history (mean IQ scores are 102.98 and 103.24). Conclusion: In patients with schizophrenia, a negative family history of psychiatric disorder was associated with relatively low IQ suggesting that the etiology in these patients may involve environmental or genetic factors which are unique to the patient and are not observed in other relatives. Possible factors include severe environmental stressors containing premature birth or brain injury and genetic factors (e.g de novo Copy Number Variants)."
24130243,Effects of daily iron supplementation in primary-school-aged children: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,Michael Low,"Background: Anemia is an important public health and clinical problem. Observational studies have linked iron deficiency and anemia in children with many poor outcomes, including impaired cognitive development; however, iron supplementation, a widely used preventive and therapeutic strategy, is associated with adverse effects. Primary-school-aged children are at a critical stage in intellectual development, and optimization of their cognitive performance could have long-lasting individual and population benefits. In this study, we summarize the evidence for the benefits and safety of daily iron supplementation in primary-school-aged children. Methods: We searched electronic databases (including MEDLINE and Embase) and other sources (July 2013) for randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials involving daily iron supplementation in children aged 5-12 years. We combined the data using random effects meta-analysis. Results: We identified 16 501 studies; of these, we evaluated 76 full-text papers and included 32 studies including 7089 children. Of the included studies, 31 were conducted in low- or middle-income settings. Iron supplementation improved global cognitive scores (standardized mean difference 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.11 to 0.90, p = 0.01), intelligence quotient among anemic children (mean difference 4.55, 95% CI 0.16 to 8.94, p = 0.04) and measures of attention and concentration. Iron supplementation also improved age-adjusted height among all children and age-adjusted weight among anemic children. Iron supplementation reduced the risk of anemia by 50% and the risk of iron deficiency by 79%. Adherence in the trial settings was generally high. Safety data were limited. Interpretation: Our analysis suggests that iron supplementation safely improves hematologic and nonhematologic outcomes among primary-school-aged children in low- or middle-income settings and is well-tolerated."
24129098,Dopamine D1 sensitivity in the prefrontal cortex predicts general cognitive abilities and is modulated by working memory training,Christopher Wass,"A common source of variance (i.e., ""general intelligence"") underlies an individual's performance across diverse tests of cognitive ability, and evidence indicates that the processing efficacy of working memory may serve as one such source of common variance. One component of working memory, selective attention, has been reported to co-vary with general intelligence, and dopamine D1 signaling in prefrontal cortex can modulate attentional abilities. Based on their aggregate performance across five diverse tests of learning, here we characterized the general cognitive ability (GCA) of CD-1 outbred mice. In response to a D1 agonist (SKF82958, 1 mg/kg), we then assessed the relationship between GCA and activation of D1 receptor (D1R)-containing neurons in the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex, the agranular insular cortex, and the dorsomedial striatum. Increased activation of D1R-containing neurons in the prelimbic cortex (but not the agranular insular cortex or dorsomedial striatum) was observed in animals of high GCA relative to those of low GCA (quantified by c-Fos activation in response to the D1 agonist). However, a Western blot analysis revealed no differences in the density of D1Rs in the prelimbic cortex between animals of high and low GCA. Last, it was observed that working memory training promoted an increase in animals' GCA and enhanced D1R-mediated neuronal activation in the prelimbic cortex. These results suggest that the sensitivity (but not density) of D1Rs in the prelimbic cortex may both regulate GCA and be a target for working memory training."
24128597,The behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia: a challenging diagnosis],Flora Gossink,"We present the case of a 52-year-old man who was diagnosed with the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) in accordance with consortium criteria from 1998. The diagnosis was questioned in the years of follow-up, since neuroimaging showed no abnormalities and no deterioration of clinical symptoms was seen. After 3 years, the diagnosis was withdrawn after the psychiatrist concluded that his low intelligence, combined with a cluster C personality and relational problems, had caused his altered behaviour. Diagnosing bvFTD is challenging because of its clinical resemblance to neurodegenerative and psychiatric illnesses. The new bvFTD consortium criteria from 2011 emphasize the importance of distinguishing possible and probable bvFTD. This can reduce the number of incorrect diagnoses. We present a flow chart based on these criteria, which could aid in improving the diagnostic process."
24127867,"Making up intelligence scales: De Sanctis's and Binet's tests, 1905 and after",Elisabetta Cicciola,"Sante De Sanctis (1862-1935) and Alfred Binet (1857-1911), the latter in collaboration with Théodore Simon (1873-1960), introduced their intelligence tests to the scientific community at the Fifth International Congress of Psychology, held in Rome in 1905 on April 26-30. The cultural and political contexts within which De Sanctis and Binet developed their respective intelligence tests showed certain similarities. Nevertheless, De Sanctis's intelligence test and Binet's test did differ in certain respects. The objective of this article is to understand the differences and similarities between the Parisian and the Roman contexts in relation to mental testing, and to investigate the theoretical-methodological contributions of each. In addition, the article analyzes the ""diversity"" of De Sanctis's context and test, which did not influence the international psychology.

24126948,Multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroids for preterm birth study: outcomes in children at 5 years of age (MACS-5),Elizabeth V Asztalos,"Importance: A single course of antenatal corticosteroid therapy is recommended for pregnant women at risk of preterm birth between 24 and 33 weeks' gestational age. However, 50% of women remain pregnant 7 to 14 days later, leading to the question of whether additional courses should be given to women remaining at risk for preterm birth. The Multiple Courses of Antenatal Corticosteroids for Preterm Birth Study (MACS) was an international randomized clinical trial that compared multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroids with a single course in women at risk of preterm birth. Objective: To determine the effects of single vs multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroid therapy on death or neurodevelopmental disability (neuromotor, neurosensory, or neurocognitive/neurobehavioral function) at 5 years of age in children whose mothers participated in MACS. Our secondary aims were to determine the effect on height, weight, head circumference, blood pressure, intelligence, and specific cognitive (visual, spatial, and language) skills. Design, setting, and participants: Cohort follow-up study of children seen between June 2006 and May 2012 at 55 centers. In total, 1724 women (2141 children) were eligible for the study, of whom 1728 children (80.7% of the 2141 eligible children) participated and 1719 children contributed to the primary outcome. Intervention: Single and multiple courses of antenatal corticosteroid therapy. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was death or survival with a neurodevelopmental disability in 1 of the following domains: neuromotor (nonambulatory cerebral palsy), neurosensory (blindness, deafness, or need for visual/hearing aids), or neurocognitive/neurobehavioral function (abnormal attention, memory, or behavior). Results: There was no significant difference between the groups in the risk of death or neurodevelopmental disability: 217 of 871 children (24.9%) in the multiple-courses group vs 210 of 848 children (24.8%) in the single-course group (odds ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.81 to 1.29]; P = .84). Conclusions and relevance: Multiple courses, compared with a single course, of antenatal corticosteroid therapy did not increase or decrease the risk of death or disability at 5 years of age. Because of a lack of strong conclusive evidence of short-term or long-term benefits, it remains our opinion that multiple courses not be recommended in women with ongoing risk of preterm birth. Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00187382."
24126010,The growth of very-low-birth-weight infants at 5 years old in Taiwan,Pei-Wei Wang,"Background: The goal of this study was to compare the growth and effect of growth on cognitive performance at 5 years of age of a group of very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants and a group of healthy full-term infants. Methods: Beginning in 1995, under the sponsorship of the Premature Baby Foundation, the Society of Neonatology, Taiwan, conducted a multicenter follow-up study of VLBW infants in Taiwan. The study enrolled 322 VLBW infants and 103 controls for assessment of growth data and cognitive performance at several time points from birth through to 5 years of age. Growth data were assessed with measurements of weight, height, and head circumference taken at the ages of 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 60 months. Cognitive performance was assessed at the age of 5 years. The VLBW infants were regarded as ""failed"" if a measurement was 2 standard deviations below the mean measurement of the control group. Neonatal and perinatal data had been collected prospectively as part of a longitudinal study. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Chinese version of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-R). Results: From 6 months to 5 years, VLBW infants had lower weight, height, and head circumference than the controls. Two hundred twenty-four VLBW infants (69.6%) returned for assessment at 5 years old. Of the 224 VLBW infants, complete sets of measurements of weight, height, and head circumference were obtained for 126 cases (56.3%), 127 cases (56.7%), and 106 cases (47.3%), respectively. Of these, 13 patients (10.3%) failed in weight, 11 patients (8.7%) failed in height, and 17 patients (16.0%) failed in head circumference at the age of 5 years. The mean WPPSI-R scores at the age of 5 years for VLBW children were: 94.1 ± 16.4 (performance IQ), 87.2 ± 12.8 (verbal IQ), and 89.5 ± 14.6 (full IQ). All of these values were also lower than those of the control group, with the differences being statistically significant (p < 0.05). The WPPSI-R scores of VLBW children who failed in head circumference were notably lower than those of VLBW children whose head circumference had caught up with that of their peers. Conclusion: The growth of VLBW infants was lower than that of healthy full-term infants through 5 years of age. The cognitive performance for VLBW children was also decreased compared to that of the control group, and there was an association between slower growth and decreased cognitive ability."
24125944,Neonatal and neurodevelopmental outcome of children aged 3-10 years born following assisted oocyte activation,Frauke Vanden Meerschaut,"Assisted oocyte activation (AOA) using a calcium ionophore has been used for more than a decade following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) fertilization failure. However, since AOA does not mimic precisely the physiological fertilization process, concerns exist about its use in human assisted reproduction. This study assessed the neonatal and neurodevelopmental outcome of children aged ≥ 3 years who had been born following AOA in our centre. Twenty-one children participated in the study (81% response rate; mean age 63.6 ± 21.07 months). Neonatal data were collected via questionnaires. Neurodevelopmental outcome was tested using the Reynell Developmental Language Scales or Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children III. Behaviour was scored by the Social Communication Questionnaire, the Child Behaviour Checklist and the Teachers Report Form. For all tests and questionnaires, the mean outcomes lay within the expected ranges. These are first data on the developmental outcome of AOA children. The high response rate and the robustness of the tests support the data, which are reassuring although still considered preliminary. Therefore, AOA should still be performed only in selected couples."
24125857,EEG-neurofeedback for optimising performance. I: a review of cognitive and affective outcome in healthy participants,John H Gruzelier,"A re-emergence of research on EEG-neurofeedback followed controlled evidence of clinical benefits and validation of cognitive/affective gains in healthy participants including correlations in support of feedback learning mediating outcome. Controlled studies with healthy and elderly participants, which have increased exponentially, are reviewed including protocols from the clinic: sensory-motor rhythm, beta1 and alpha/theta ratios, down-training theta maxima, and from neuroscience: upper-alpha, theta, gamma, alpha desynchronisation. Outcome gains include sustained attention, orienting and executive attention, the P300b, memory, spatial rotation, RT, complex psychomotor skills, implicit procedural memory, recognition memory, perceptual binding, intelligence, mood and well-being. Twenty-three of the controlled studies report neurofeedback learning indices along with beneficial outcomes, of which eight report correlations in support of a meditation link, results which will be supplemented by further creativity and the performing arts evidence in Part II. Validity evidence from optimal performance studies represents an advance for the neurofeedback field demonstrating that cross fertilisation between clinical and optimal performance domains will be fruitful. Theoretical and methodological issues are outlined further in Part III."
24124775,Theory of mind and language comprehension in schizophrenia,José M Gavilán Ibáñez,"Background: Theory of mind (ToM) is the natural ability to attribute/infer mental states about ourselves and others. The study of the limits of this capacity in autism-spectrum disorders has been projected more recently to the case of schizophrenia. Method: We review the studies on ToM deficiency in schizophrenia, based on the link observed by Chris Frith between psychotic symptoms and mentalizing anomalies, with particular attention to the implications of ToM in linguistic communication in the field of figurative language comprehension. Results: The data support a connection between ToM deficits and psychotic symptoms. In schizophrenia, the deficit in ToM appears to be specific and not dependent on more general cognitive abilities, and according to the evidence examined, it resembles a trait more than a state condition. The analysis of results shows that anomalies in ToM have projections on pragmatic aspects of language comprehension. Conclusions: ToM deficits showed by schizophrenic patients are especially linked to difficulties in understanding figurative language, beyond the influence of intelligence and executive functions."
24124306,Clinical spectrum of Silver - Russell syndrome,Sapna N K Varma,"Silver - Russell syndrome is a clinically and genetically heterogenous condition characterized by severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation, craniofacial disproportion and normal intelligence downward curvature of the corner of the mouth, syndactyly and webbed fingers. Diagnosis of Silver - Russell syndrome remains clinical; no definite etiology or specific tests have been established. In the recent years, it has been shown that more than 38% of patients have hypomethylation in the imprinting control region 1 of 11p15 and one-tenth of patients carry a maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome seven. The pathophysiological mechanisms resulting in the Silver - Russell phenotype remain unknown despite the recent progress in deciphering the molecular defects associated with this condition. This case report describes the clinical features of Silver - Russell syndrome in a father and daughter."
24121558,Artificial intelligence in nanotechnology,G M Sacha,"During the last decade there has been increasing use of artificial intelligence tools in nanotechnology research. In this paper we review some of these efforts in the context of interpreting scanning probe microscopy, the study of biological nanosystems, the classification of material properties at the nanoscale, theoretical approaches and simulations in nanoscience, and generally in the design of nanodevices. Current trends and future perspectives in the development of nanocomputing hardware that can boost artificial-intelligence-based applications are also discussed. Convergence between artificial intelligence and nanotechnology can shape the path for many technological developments in the field of information sciences that will rely on new computer architectures and data representations, hybrid technologies that use biological entities and nanotechnological devices, bioengineering, neuroscience and a large variety of related disciplines."
24121098,In search for a public health leadership competency framework to support leadership curriculum-a consensus study,Katarzyna Czabanowska,"Background: Competency-based education is increasingly popular, especially in the area of continuing professional development. Many competency frameworks have been developed; however, few address leadership competencies for European public health professionals. The aim of this study was to develop a public health leadership competency framework to inform a leadership curriculum for public health professionals. The framework was developed as part of the Leaders for European Public Health project-supported by the EU Lifelong Learning Programme. Methods: The study was carried out in three phases: a literature review, consensus development panel and Delphi survey. The public health leadership competency framework was initially developed from a literature review. A preliminary list of competencies was submitted to a panel of experts. Two consensus development panels were held to evaluate and make changes to the initial draft competency framework. Then two rounds of a Delphi survey were carried out in an effort to reach consensus. Both surveys were presented through Survey Monkey to members of the Association of the Schools of Public Health in the European Region Working Group on Innovation in Public Health Teaching and Education. Results: The framework was developed consisting of 52 competencies organized into eight domains: Systems Thinking; Political Leadership; Collaborative Leadership: Building and Leading Interdisciplinary Teams; Leadership and Communication; Leading Change; Emotional Intelligence and Leadership in Team-based Organizations; Leadership, Organizational Learning and Development and Ethics and Professionalism. Conclusion: The framework can serve as a useful tool in identifying gaps in knowledge and skills, and shaping competency-based continuing professional development leadership curricula for public health professionals in Europe."
24120386,Iodine deficiency in Egyptian autistic children and their mothers: relation to disease severity,Rasha T Hamza,"Background and aims: Because autism may be a disease of early fetal brain development, maternal hypothyroxinemia (HT) in early pregnancy secondary to iodine deficiency (ID) may be related to etiology of autism. The aim of the study was to assess the iodine nutritional status in Egyptian autistic children and their mothers and its relationship with disease characteristics. Methods: Fifty autistic children and their mothers were studied in comparison to 50 controls. All subjects were subjected to clinical evaluation, measurement of urinary iodine (UI), free triiodothyronine (fT3), free tetraiodothyronine (fT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) along with measurement of thyroid volume (TV). In addition, electroencephalography (EEG) and intelligence quotient (IQ) assessment were done for all autistic children. Results: Of autistic children and their mothers, 54% and 58%, respectively, were iodine deficient. None of the control children or their mothers was iodine deficient. UI was lower among autistic patients (p <0.001) and their mothers (p <0.001). Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score correlated negatively with UI (r = -0.94, p <0.001). Positive correlations were detected between autistic patients and their mothers regarding UI (r = 0.88, p <0.001), fT3 (r = 0.79, p = 0.03), fT4 (r = 0.91, p <0.001) and TSH (r = 0.69, p = 0.04). Autism had a significant risk for association with each of low UI (OR: 9.5, 95% CI: 2.15-33.8, p = 0.02) and intake of noniodized salt (OR: 6.82, 95% CI = 1.36-34.27, p = 0.031). Conclusions: ID is prevalent in Egyptian autistic children and their mothers and was inversely related to disease severity and could be related to its etiology."
24120329,Cognitive profile in Wilson's disease: a case series of 31 patients,E Wenisch,"Background: Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. If untreated, WD, which is initially a liver disease, can turn into a multi-systemic disease with neurological involvement. Very few studies have described cognitive impairment in WD. The aim of this study is to report the cognitive profile of 31 treated WD patients. Methods: Patients were classed into two groups using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS): WD patients without neurological signs (WD-N(-)) (n=13), and WD patients with neurological signs (WD-N(+)) (n=18). The patients participated in a neuropsychological assessment evaluating memory, executive function and visuo-spatial abilities. Results: Both groups performed well for verbal intelligence and episodic memory skills. However, the majority of these patients exhibited altered performance for at least one cognitive test, particularly in the executive domain. The WD-N(+) group performed less well than the WD-N(-) group on cognitive tests involving rapid motor function, abstract thinking, working memory and top-down inhibitory control. Conclusions: Cognitive impairment in treated WD patients essentially affects executive function involving fronto-striatal circuits. Verbal intelligence and episodic memory abilities seem to be remarkably preserved. Neuropsychological assessment is a valuable tool to evaluate the presence and the consequences of these cognitive impairments in WD patients with or without neurological signs in the course of this chronic disease."
24118522,"Effect of spiritual intelligence, emotional intelligence, psychological ownership and burnout on caring behaviour of nurses: a cross-sectional study",Devinder Kaur,"Aims and objectives: To propose a model of prediction of caring behaviour among nurses that includes spiritual intelligence, emotional intelligence, psychological ownership and burnout. Background: Caring behaviour of nurses contributes to the patients' satisfaction, well-being and subsequently to the performance of the healthcare organisations. This behaviour is influenced by physiological, psychological, sociocultural, developmental and spiritual factors. Design: A cross-sectional survey was used, and data were analysed using descriptive statistics and structural equation modelling. Methods: Data were collected between July-August 2011. A sample of 550 nurses in practice from seven public hospitals in and around Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) completed the questionnaire that captured five constructs. Besides nurses, 348 patients from seven hospitals participated in the study and recorded their overall satisfaction with the hospital and the services provided by the nurses. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). Results: The key findings are: (1) spiritual intelligence influences emotional intelligence and psychological ownership, (2) emotional intelligence influences psychological ownership, burnout and caring behaviour of nurses, (3) psychological ownership influences burnout and caring behaviour of nurses, (4) burnout influences caring behaviour of nurses, (5) psychological ownership mediates the relationship between spiritual intelligence and caring behaviour and between emotional intelligence and caring behaviour of nurses and (6) burnout mediates the relationship between spiritual intelligence and caring behaviour and between psychological ownership and caring behaviour of nurses. Conclusions: Identifying the factors that affect caring behaviour of nurses is critical to improving the quality of patient care. Spiritual intelligence, emotional intelligence, psychological ownership and burnout of nurses play a significant role in effecting caring behaviour of nurses. Relevance to clinical practice: Healthcare providers must consider the relationships between these factors in their continuing care and incorporation of these in the nursing curricula and training."
24118163,Relationship between self-compassion and emotional intelligence in nursing students,Emine Şenyuva,"Nursing focuses on meeting physical, social and emotional health-care needs of individuals, families and society. In health care, nurses directly communicate with patients and try to empathize with them. Nurses give care under emotionally intense conditions where the individual undergoes pain and distress. Research is aimed at analysing the correlation of self-compassion and emotional intelligence of nursing students. The population of the research consisted of all the undergraduate students (571 students) of the 2010-2011 fall semester of the department of nursing. An information form, Self-compassion Scale and Emotional Intelligence Assessment Scale were utilized to obtain data for the research. For the assessment of the findings of research, Statistical Package for Social Sciences 16.0 for Windows was utilized for statistical analysis. Results indicated that there is a correlation between self-compassion and emotional intelligence and that emotional intelligence, which includes the individual perceiving one's emotions and using the knowledge one gained from them to function while directing thoughts, actions and professional applications, has positive contributions to the features of nurses with developed self-compassion."
24117984,The importance of language in the home for school-age children with permanent hearing loss,Betty R Vohr,"Aim: To determine the characteristics of the natural spoken language environment associated with better language skills at school age of children with permanent hearing loss (HL) screened in a newborn hearing screen programme. Methods: A language processor recorded language environment including child vocalisations (CVs), conversational turns (CTs), adult word count (AWC), percentage of language and percentage of silence in 23 children with HL and 41 hearing controls. Relationships of language environment scores with Reynell language scores were analysed. Results: Children with HL had significantly lower Reynell comprehension scores (15-25 points; p = 0.0001) and expressive scores (7-12 points; NS) than hearing children. In regression analyses for the children with HL, after adjusting for age of entry to early intervention and stay in a NICU, every increase in ten percentage points of language in the home was associated with 7.2 points higher comprehension score (p = 0.027) and 9.99 points higher expressive score (p = 0.006). After adjusting for nonverbal intelligence, similar independent effects of the language environment on both comprehension (p = 0.027) and expressive scores (p = 0.006) were identified. Conclusion: A rich language environment in the home is associated with better language abilities, which are necessary for academic success for children with permanent HL at school age."
24117532,Early lexical development and risk of verbal and nonverbal cognitive delay at school age,Akhgar Ghassabian,"Aim: To characterise the relationship between preschool lexical delay and language comprehension and nonverbal intelligence at school age. Methods: The mothers of 2724 children completed the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory when their child reached 1.5 years and the Language Development Survey and the Parent Report of Children's Ability at 2.5 years. When the children were 6 years old, we assessed vocabulary comprehension and nonverbal intelligence using Dutch batteries for language and nonverbal intelligence. Results: Demographic factors explained 9.9% of the variance in vocabulary comprehension and 8.7% of the variance in nonverbal intelligence at 6 years. Male gender, low maternal education and non-Western ethnic background predicted vocabulary comprehension delay at 6 years. Lexical development at 1.5 and 2.5 years explained only 3.8% of the variance in language comprehension at the age of six. Late onset expressive vocabulary delay increased the risk of language comprehension and nonverbal intelligence delay at 6 years (OR=2.31, 95% CI: 1.62-3.29 and OR=1.74, 95% CI: 1.17-2.58, respectively). Conclusion: Sociodemographic factors are important predictors of delays in language and nonverbal abilities as children enter school. In contrast, early expressive lexical delays, in particular before the age of two, have limited predictive power for language delays at the age of six."
24116864,"A cohort study on full breastfeeding and child neuropsychological development: the role of maternal social, psychological, and nutritional factors",Jordi Julvez,"Aim: This study investigated whether duration of full breastfeeding is associated with child neuropsychological development and whether this association is explained by social, psychological, and nutritional factors within families. Method: Participants in this study were a population-based birth cohort in the city of Sabadell (Catalonia, Spain). Females were recruited during the first trimester of pregnancy between July 2004 and July 2006. Information about parental characteristics and breastfeeding was obtained through questionnaires. Full breastfeeding was categorized as never, short term (≤4mo), long term (4-6mo), or very long term (>6mo). A trained psychologist assessed the neuropsychological development of children at 4 years of age (n=434) using the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA). Results: Full breastfeeding showed an independent association with child general MSCA scores after adjusting for a range of social, psychological, and nutritional factors (>6mo, coefficient=7.4 [95% confidence interval=2.8-12.0], p=0.011). Maternal social class, education level, and IQ were also associated with child neuropsychological scores, but did not explain breastfeeding associations. Omega-3 (n3) fatty acid levels were not associated with child neuropsychological scores. Interpretation: Very long-term full breastfeeding was independently associated with neuropsychological functions of children at 4 years of age. Maternal indicators of intelligence, psychopathology, and colostrum n3 fatty acids did not explain this association."
24116395,Bilateral stereotactic radiofrequency amygdalohippocampectomy for a patient with bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy,Huimin Luo,"To search for a method for treatment of bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (BTLE), we report one patient with BTLE experienced bilateral stereotactic radiofrequency amygdalohippocampectomy (SAHE). Neuropsychological examinations were performed before and 5 days, and 6, 18, and 48 months after operation. No seizure occurred in the follow-up time, and no long-term memory and intelligence deficits were found except for a transient decline of the scores immediately after operation. Because severe damage of memory could be caused by bilateral resection surgery, bilateral SAHE should be considered as a possible approach for the treatment of BTLE. However, further studies with accumulation of cases are needed, especially in the detailed assessment of neuropsychological function."
24116230,Paternal age and general cognitive ability-a cross sectional study of Danish male conscripts,John McGrath,"Objectives: Offspring of older men have impaired cognitive ability as children, but it is unclear if this impairment persists into adulthood. The main objective of this study was to explore the association between paternal age at offspring birth and general cognitive ability as young adults. Design: Population-based cross-sectional study with prospectively collected data on obstetric factors and parental education. Setting: Nationwide Danish sample. Participants: Male conscripts (n = 169,009). Primary and secondary outcome measures: General cognitive ability as assessed by the Børge Priens test score, an intelligence test with components related to logical, verbal, numerical and spatial reasoning. Results: We observed an inverse U-shaped association between paternal age and general cognitive ability (slightly lower test scores in the offspring of fathers aged less than 25 years and older than 40 years, compared with fathers aged 25 to 29 years). However, after adjustment for maternal age, parental education and birth order the shape of the association changed. Offspring of fathers younger than 20 still showed slightly lower cognitive ability (-1.11 (95% CI -1.68 to -0.54)), but no significant impairments were identified in the men whose fathers were older than 29 years at the time of their birth (e.g. the mean difference in test score in the offspring of fathers aged 40 to 44 years were -0.03 [95% CI (-0.27 to 0.20)] compared with fathers aged 25 to 29 years). Conclusions: We did not find that the offspring of older fathers had impaired cognitive ability as young adults. Whereas, we found a tendency that the offspring of teen fathers have lower cognitive ability. Thus, our results suggest that any potentially deleterious effects of older fathers on general cognitive ability as young adults may be counter-balanced by other potentially beneficial factors."
24114510,Increased response conflict in recreational cocaine polydrug users,Roberta Sellaro,"Recent studies suggest that recreational use of cocaine is associated with significant impairments in the same cognitive control functions that are affected by chronic use. Here we tested whether recreational cocaine use can impact the emergence and resolution of response conflict in conflict-inducing tasks. Recreational cocaine polydrug users (n = 17) and cocaine-free controls (n = 17), matched for sex, age, intelligence, and alcohol consumption, performed a Simon task-which is known to induce response conflict. Recreational users showed a larger Simon effect, indicating that they had more difficulty resolving stimulus-induced response conflict. This finding is consistent with the recent literature showing that even small doses of cocaine are sufficient to compromise key cognitive control functions."
24111331,Bio-robots automatic navigation with graded electric reward stimulation based on Reinforcement Learning,Chen Zhang,"Bio-robots based on brain computer interface (BCI) suffer from the lack of considering the characteristic of the animals in navigation. This paper proposed a new method for bio-robots' automatic navigation combining the reward generating algorithm base on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the learning intelligence of animals together. Given the graded electrical reward, the animal e.g. the rat, intends to seek the maximum reward while exploring an unknown environment. Since the rat has excellent spatial recognition, the rat-robot and the RL algorithm can convergent to an optimal route by co-learning. This work has significant inspiration for the practical development of bio-robots' navigation with hybrid intelligence."
24110936,Ratbot automatic navigation by electrical reward stimulation based on distance measurement in unknown environments,Liqiang Gao,"Traditional automatic navigation methods for bio-robots are constrained to configured environments and thus can't be applied to tasks in unknown environments. With no consideration of bio-robot's own innate living ability and treating bio-robots in the same way as mechanical robots, those methods neglect the intelligence behavior of animals. This paper proposes a novel ratbot automatic navigation method in unknown environments using only reward stimulation and distance measurement. By utilizing rat's habit of thigmotaxis and its reward-seeking behavior, this method is able to incorporate rat's intrinsic intelligence of obstacle avoidance and path searching into navigation. Experiment results show that this method works robustly and can successfully navigate the ratbot to a target in the unknown environment. This work might put a solid base for application of ratbots and also has significant implication of automatic navigation for other bio-robots as well."
24109563,"The dilemma of the symbols: analogies between philosophy, biology and artificial life",Salvatore Spadaro,"This article analyzes some analogies going from Artificial Life questions about the symbol-matter connection to Artificial Intelligence questions about symbol-grounding. It focuses on the notion of the interpretability of syntax and how the symbols are integrated in a unity (""binding problem""). Utilizing the DNA code as a model, this paper discusses how syntactic features could be defined as high-grade characteristics of the non syntactic relations in a material-dynamic structure, by using an emergentist approach. This topic furnishes the ground for a confutation of J. Searle's statement that syntax is observer-relative, as he wrote in his book ""Mind: A Brief Introduction"". Moreover the evolving discussion also modifies the classic symbol-processing doctrine in the mind which Searle attacks as a strong AL argument, that life could be implemented in a computational mode. Lastly, this paper furnishes a new way of support for the autonomous systems thesis in Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence, using, inter alia, the ""adaptive resonance theory"" (ART)."
24108618,The development of the Multidimensional Social Competence Scale: a standardized measure of social competence in autism spectrum disorders,Jodi Yager,"Autism and its related disorders are commonly described as lying along a continuum that ranges in severity and are collectively referred to as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Although all individuals with ASD meet the social impairment diagnostic criteria outlined in the DSM-IV-TR, they do not present with the same social difficulties. The variability in the expression and severity of social competence is particularly evident among the group of individuals with ""high-functioning"" ASD who appear to have difficulty applying their average to above average intelligence in a social context. There is a striking paucity of empirical research investigating individual differences in social functioning among individuals with high-functioning ASD. It is possible that more detailed investigations of social competence have been impeded by the lack of standardized measures available to assess the nature and severity of social impairment. The aim of the current study was to develop and evaluate a parent rating scale capable of assessing individual differences in social competence (i.e. strengths and challenges) among adolescents with ASD: the Multidimensional Social Competence Scale (MSCS). Results from confirmatory factor analyses supported the hypothesized multidimensional factor structure of the MSCS. Seven relatively distinct domains of social competence were identified including social motivation, social inferencing, demonstrating empathic concern, social knowledge, verbal conversation skills, nonverbal sending skills, and emotion regulation. Psychometric evidence provided preliminary support for the reliability and validity of the scale. Possible applications of this promising new parent rating scale in both research and clinical settings are discussed."
24108066,Treatment of intractable anorexia nervosa with inactivation of the nucleus accumbens using stereotactic surgery,Jing Wang,"Background: For 30% of anorexia nervosa (AN) patients, conventional treatments are unsuccessful; this is termed intractable AN. Objectives: This study investigates whether ablation of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) using stereotactic surgery can arouse the physiological drive to eat in intractable AN patients. Methods: Eight patients with intractable AN were included: 6 patients underwent bilateral stereotactic radio frequency ablation in the NAc and 2 patients received bilateral NAc deep brain stimulation (DBS). Observations were made for basic vital signs, body mass index (BMI), menstruation, depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, personality, intelligence, memory, quality of life, social functioning, as well as complications and adverse events associated with the treatment. Results: Basic vital signs, BMI and menstruation had recovered 1 year after the operation. Depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder were improved 1 year postoperatively. There were changes in personality scores for psychoticism, neuroticism and lie tendencies that seemed to be helpful to the recovery from AN. Intelligence and memory improved after 6 months postoperatively. Quality of life and social functioning were dramatically improved at 1 year postoperatively. Conclusions: The results of this study reveal that ablation of the NAc can increase the AN patients' physiological drive to eat. Furthermore, there were no severe and/or life-influencing complications associated with the treatment."
24107643,Comorbidities associated with vitiligo: a ten-year retrospective study,Vaneeta M Sheth,"Background: Vitiligo is a common disorder of depigmentation that has been associated with other autoimmune diseases. No recent large-scale data exist on the rates of comorbidities associated with vitiligo from the United States population. Objectives: To identify the prevalence of comorbidities as well as associated laboratory abnormalities in vitiligo patients. Methods: All medical records dating from January 1, 2000 to June 21, 2011 within the Research Patient Data Repository were evaluated retrospectively using a novel artificial intelligence-based computer program. A total of 3,280 patients carrying the diagnosis of vitiligo were identified using ICD-9 code 709.01. We randomly selected 300 patients and validated the diagnosis by manually reviewing their medical records. These results were used to create a model that was then applied to the larger set yielding 2,441 true vitiligo patients. 1,657 (68%) were diagnosed by dermatologists and 784 (32%) by non-dermatologists. We identified the prevalence of other comorbid autoimmune conditions by searching problem lists of vitiligo patients and collected laboratory data from the first available data point in the system for each patient. Results: Women were more frequently represented (57.6%) than men (42.4%). The majority of vitiligo patients were White/Caucasian (56.9%), followed by Hispanic/Latino (19.4%). 565 (23%) had one of the following comorbidities: 287 thyroid-related, 186 psoriasis, 72 rheumatoid arthritis, 59 alopecia areata, 55 inflammatory bowel disease, 53 systemic lupus and 20 type I diabetes mellitus. 41% had elevated anti-nuclear antibody levels. Almost half of the patients tested had elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Over 50% of the patients tested had low or insufficient levels of 25-OH vitamin D. Conclusion: We found a high prevalence of comorbidities among individuals with vitiligo presenting to teaching hospitals in Boston, Mass. Comorbid autoimmune conditions were seen in 23% of vitiligo patients, thyroid disorders and psoriasis being the most common. Screening for these conditions, especially thyroid disorders, should be considered in vitiligo patients."
24107367,Swarm intelligence: when uncertainty meets conflict,Larissa Conradt,"Good decision making is important for the survival and fitness of stakeholders, but decisions usually involve uncertainty and conflict. We know surprisingly little about profitable decision-making strategies in conflict situations. On the one hand, sharing decisions with others can pool information and decrease uncertainty (swarm intelligence). On the other hand, sharing decisions can hand influence to individuals whose goals conflict. Thus, when should an animal share decisions with others? Using a theoretical model, we show that, contrary to intuition, decision sharing by animals with conflicting goals often increases individual gains as well as decision accuracy. Thus, conflict-far from hampering effective decision making-can improve decision outcomes for all stakeholders, as long as they share large-scale goals. In contrast, decisions shared by animals without conflict were often surprisingly poor. The underlying mechanism is that animals with conflicting goals are less correlated in individual choice errors. These results provide a strong argument in the interest of all stakeholders for not excluding other (e.g., minority) factions from collective decisions. The observed benefits of including diverse factions among the decision makers could also be relevant to human collective decision making."
24107039,Joined-up thinking,Jennifer Trueland,In 2001 the Department of Health instructed NHS trusts to develop networks to support black and minority ethnic staff. Since then networks have fallen out of favour and may have folded. Supporters argue that trusts neglect networks at their peril- they are an in valuable source of intelligence about what is happening to front line staff and patients.
24106975,Are sexes affected differently by ketamine? An exploratory study in ketamine users,Hua Jun Liang,"One hundred primary ketamine users and 100 controls were recruited in Hong Kong between December 2009 and December 2011. Cognitive assessment included general intelligence, working, verbal, and visual memory, and executive functions. A Univariate General Linear Model was used to compare cognitive performance between the male and female ketamine users and controls. The female users appeared to have a higher risk of visual memory impairment than their male counterparts. Further studies are warranted to clarify the mechanism of the sex-specific effect of ketamine on cognitive functions."
24106132,Age and sensory processing abnormalities predict declines in encoding and recall of temporally manipulated speech in high-functioning adults with ASD,Jennifer L Mayer,"While temporal and perceptual processing abnormalities, identified in a number of electrophysiological and brain imaging studies of individuals with (ASD), are likely to impact on speech perception, surprisingly little is known about the behavioral outcomes of such abnormalities. It has been hypothesized that rapid temporal processing deficits may be linked to impaired language development through interference with acoustic information during speech perception. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of temporal changes on encoding and recall of speech, and the associated cognitive, clinical, and behavioral correlates in adults with ASD. Research carried out with typically developing (TD) adults has shown that word recall diminishes as the speed of speech increases, and it was predicted that the magnitude of this effect would be far greater in those with ASD because of a preexisting rapid temporal processing deficit. Nineteen high-functioning adults with ASD, and age- and intelligence-matched TD controls performed verbatim recall of temporally manipulated sentences. Reduced levels of word recall in response to increases in presentation speed were observed, and this effect was greater in the older participants in the ASD group than in the control group. This is the first study to show that both sensory abnormalities and aging impact on speech encoding in ASD. Auditory processing deficits in ASD may be indicative of an association with the sensory abnormalities and social and communication impairments characterizing the disorder."
24105433,"High-functioning autism spectrum disorder as a basic disorder in adult psychiatry and psychotherapy: psychopathological presentation, clinical relevance and therapeutic concepts",Ludger Tebartz van Elst,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social cognition and competence, communication, highly circumscribed interests and a strong desire for routines. Besides, there are specific abnormalities in perception and language. Typical symptoms are already present in early childhood. Traditionally autism has been regarded as a severe form of neurodevelopmental disorder which goes along with overtly abnormal language, learning difficulties and low IQ in the majority of cases. However, over the last decades, it has become clear that there are also many patients with high-functioning variants of ASD. These are patients with normal language at a superficial level of description and normal and sometimes above average intelligence. In high-functioning variants of the disease, they may run unrecognized until late in adult life. High-functioning ASD is associated with a very high prevalence of comorbid classical psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, ADHD, tics, psychotic symptoms or emotionally unstable syndromes. In many such cases, there is a causal relationship between ASD and the comorbid psychiatric conditions in that the specific ASD symptoms result in chronic conflicts, misunderstandings and failure in private and vocational relationships. These problems in turn often lead to depression, anxiety and sometimes psychosis-like stress reactions. In this constellation, ASD has to be regarded as a basic disorder with causal relevance for secondary psychiatric syndromes. In this paper, we summarize the classical presentation of high-functioning ASD in adult psychiatry and psychotherapy and suggest a nosological model to classify different ASD conditions instead. To conclude, we outline first treatment concepts in out- and in-patient settings."
24104504,"On the nature and nurture of intelligence and specific cognitive abilities: the more heritable, the more culture dependent",Kees-Jan Kan,"To further knowledge concerning the nature and nurture of intelligence, we scrutinized how heritability coefficients vary across specific cognitive abilities both theoretically and empirically. Data from 23 twin studies (combined N = 7,852) showed that (a) in adult samples, culture-loaded subtests tend to demonstrate greater heritability coefficients than do culture-reduced subtests; and (b) in samples of both adults and children, a subtest's proportion of variance shared with general intelligence is a function of its cultural load. These findings require an explanation because they do not follow from mainstream theories of intelligence. The findings are consistent with our hypothesis that heritability coefficients differ across cognitive abilities as a result of differences in the contribution of genotype-environment covariance. The counterintuitive finding that the most heritable abilities are the most culture-dependent abilities sheds a new light on the long-standing nature-nurture debate of intelligence."
24103909,Superior mentalizing abilities of female patients with schizophrenia,Ahmad Abu-Akel,"Mentalizing abilities are severely disrupted in patients with schizophrenia, but gender-related differences in this domain are virtually unexplored. Given the importance of these abilities in understanding psychopathology, social functioning and outcome, this study aimed to examine the mentalizing abilities of male and female patients with schizophrenia. The cognitive and affective mentalizing abilities of self and other of clinically stable male and female patients with schizophrenia were analyzed using the abbreviated version of the Metacognitive Assessment Scale (MAS-A). Compared to their male counterparts, the female patients demonstrated superior overall mentalizing abilities. This advantage was also evident when mentalizing about the Self or the Other. When examining cognitive versus affective mentalizing, women were significantly better in their ability to attribute and understand the affective mental states of others. These differences were unrelated to intelligence or psychopathology. The superior mentalizing abilities of female patients extend gender-related differences in schizophrenia to include social cognition. This suggests that our current knowledge of socio-cognitive abilities in schizophrenia is generalizable to male but not to female patients. The findings also provide important insights to understanding how etiological differences affect social cognition. Awareness to such differences has important implications for diagnosis and clinical treatment."
24103853,"Neurocognitive changes in depressed patients in psychodynamic psychotherapy, therapy with fluoxetine and combination therapy",Andre Goettems Bastos,"Background: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy of different forms of therapy for depression are relatively common. However, there are not many RCTs comparing neurocognitive effects of these treatments. Neurocognitive changes across three types of treatment for depression were compared. Long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (LTPP) was compared with fluoxetine treatment, and their combination, in the treatment of moderate depression. Methods: A 272 adult patients with beck depression inventory (BDI) scores 20-35 were randomized to receive LTPP, fluoxetine monotherapy or their combination for a 24 months period. The Wechsler adult intelligence scale version III (WAIS-III) was the primary neuropsychological measure. Result: Multilevel mixed model analyses indicated that there were neurocognitive changes within and between treatments, with statistically significant differences over time (p>.01). LTPP and combined treatment seemed to be more efficacious in modifying specific areas of cognition than fluoxetine alone. Limitations: Sample very homogenous, threatening external validity. Conclusions: LTPP and its combination with fluoxetine demonstrated to be effective for specific neurocognitive increasing in patients with moderate depression. This study suggests marked differences over time in the neurocognitive effects between the three treatment forms compared. Results found here may be of clinical relevance for building bridges between pharmacotherapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy."
24103497,The long-term cognitive consequences of early childhood malnutrition: the case of famine in Ghana,Samuel K Ampaabeng,"We examine the role of early childhood health in human capital accumulation. Using a unique data set from Ghana with comprehensive information on individual, family, community, school quality characteristics and a direct measure of intelligence together with test scores, we examine the long-term cognitive effects of the 1983 famine on survivors. We show that differences in intelligence test scores can be robustly explained by the differential impact of the famine in different parts of the country and the impacts are most severe for children under two years of age during the famine. We also account for model uncertainty by using Bayesian Model Averaging."
24103490,Dysfunction of orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices in children and adolescents with high-functioning pervasive developmental disorders,Tetsuji Sawa,"Background: Several lines of evidence suggest that dysfunction of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) contributes to the pathophysiology of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). The purpose of this study was to investigate neuropsychological dysfunctions in both the DLPFC and OFC of children and adolescents with high-functioning PDD. Methods: The Iowa gambling task (IGT), which reflects OFC function, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), which reflects DLPFC function, were assigned to 19 children and early adolescents with high-functioning PDD and 19 healthy controls matched for gender, age, and intelligence. Results: Compared to healthy controls, patients with high-functioning PDD displayed poorer performance on the IGT and the WCST. Conclusions: These results indicate that both the DLPFC and OFC could be impaired in children and early adolescents with high-functioning PDD."
24103400,Lifelong bilingualism contributes to cognitive reserve against white matter integrity declines in aging,Brian T Gold,"Recent evidence suggests that lifelong bilingualism may contribute to cognitive reserve (CR) in normal aging. However, there is currently no neuroimaging evidence to suggest that lifelong bilinguals can retain normal cognitive functioning in the face of age-related neurodegeneration. Here we explored this issue by comparing white matter (WM) integrity and gray matter (GM) volumetric patterns of older adult lifelong bilinguals (N=20) and monolinguals (N=20). The groups were matched on a range of relevant cognitive test scores and on the established CR variables of education, socioeconomic status and intelligence. Participants underwent high-resolution structural imaging for assessment of GM volume and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for assessment of WM integrity. Results indicated significantly lower microstructural integrity in the bilingual group in several WM tracts. In particular, compared to their monolingual peers, the bilingual group showed lower fractional anisotropy and/or higher radial diffusivity in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus/inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus bilaterally, the fornix, and multiple portions of the corpus callosum. There were no group differences in GM volume. Our results suggest that lifelong bilingualism contributes to CR against WM integrity declines in aging."
24103143,Neuropsychological performance in children with temporal lobe epilepsy having normal MRI findings,Katariina Mankinen,"Background and aims: Most information on the neuropsychological performance of pediatric patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is derived from selected surgical series. Non-lesional pediatric TLE patients were studied here at the population level in order to investigate the extent to which neuropsychological deficits predisposing to learning difficulties exist in this more common group. Methods: Language, memory and executive functions were measured in children aged 8-15 years with non-lesional TLE and of normal intelligence (n = 21), and their performance was compared with that of healthy age and gender-matched children (n = 21). The effects of clinical epilepsy variables on performance were examined. Results: Although neuropsychological performance did not differ between the TLE patients and the healthy controls, female gender, early onset, longer duration and abnormal interictal EEG had a negative effect on neuropsychological performance. Conclusions: Children with early-onset epilepsy should be assessed carefully for neuropsychological impairment using sufficiently broad batteries of tests in order to detect even slight deficits. Our sample size was small and these findings should be interpreted as preliminary results and need to be confirmed in larger studies."
24103018,Neurotoxicity of sedative and analgesia drugs in young infants with congenital heart disease: 4-year follow-up,Gonzalo Garcia Guerra,"Objectives/aim: To determine whether sedation/analgesia drugs used before, during, and after infant cardiac surgery are associated with neurocognitive and functional outcomes. Background: Some animal models suggest neurotoxic effects of anesthetic drugs on the developing brain; however, potential human effects are unknown. Whether these results can be extrapolated to humans is unknown. Methods/materials: Prospective follow-up project of all infants ≤6 weeks old having surgery for congenital heart disease between 04/03 and 12/06. Demographic, perioperative, and sedation/analgesia variables were collected. Outcomes at kindergarten age were Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III, Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration (VMI-V), and General Adaptive Composite (GAC) of the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify predictor variables. Results: From 135 infants who underwent heart surgery, 19 died, 17 were excluded, 8 were lost to follow-up, leaving 91 children for analysis. Multiple linear regression found days on chloral hydrate [3.5 (3.7) days] was associated with lower performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) (Effect size -1.03; 95% CI -1.96, -0.10; P = 0.03), and cumulative dose [54.2 (60.3) mg·kg(-1) ] of benzodiazepines was associated with lower VMI scores (Effect size -0.07; 95% CI -0.12, -0.01; P = 0.026). No other associations were found between sedation/analgesia variables and full-scale IQ, PIQ, Verbal IQ, VMI, or GAC. Conclusion: Assessment of this cohort at kindergarten age found a small statistically significant association between days on chloral hydrate and PIQ, and benzodiazepine cumulative dose and lower VMI. No other association between sedation/analgesia drugs and outcomes was found."
24102763,Cognitive performance in pediatric liver transplant recipients,T Kaller,"To date, the course of cognitive development in children after liver transplantation (Ltx) is poorly understood. Cognitive performance, however, is crucial in all developmental stages and for educational achievement. This cross-sectional single-center study examined the prevalence of long-term cognitive impairment in a cohort of 64 pediatric patients after Ltx. Median age at Ltx was 12 months. The revised Wechsler Intelligence Scale IV was administered to assess cognitive performance. Patients were compared with an age- and gender-matched group of children without a chronic health condition. Liver transplanted children performed significantly worse in three of four cognitive domains as well as in the Total Intelligence Quotient (Total IQ) (p = 0.017 to p = 0.005). Liver transplant recipients showed substantially more ""serious delays"" (IQ < 70) compared to the reference group (9.4% vs. 4.7%). Children with a genetic-metabolic disease performed worse than the other groups in three of the four WISC Indices and in the Total IQ (p = 0.05 to p = 0.01). The strongest association was revealed between height at Ltx and Verbal Comprehension (R(2) = 0.21), Perceptual Reasoning (R(2) = 0.30), Working Memory (R(2) = 0.23) and Total IQ (R(2) = 0.25). Our results indicate a high impact of primary diagnosis and height percentile at Ltx even on children's long-term cognitive performance."
24102487,Voices from the past: comparing the rapid prompting method and facilitated communication,Amy Tostanoski,"Objective: This article briefly reviews the history and damage caused by facilitated communication (FC) and highlights the parallels between FC and the Rapid Prompting Method (RPM). Background: FC involves a therapist (or facilitator) supporting the hand of a person with autism while a message is typed on a letter board. FC is widely acknowledged to be a pseudoscientific, unsafe, and unethical treatment for people with autism. RPM is a more recent intervention for people with autism that involves the facilitator holding and moving the letter board while the individual with autism moves their own hand. Those who espouse the perceived benefits of FC and RPM make strikingly similar claims of hidden intelligence and extraordinary communication abilities in people with autism following treatment. Conclusion: Clients, proponents, and practitioners of RPM should demand scientific validation of RPM in order to ensure the safety of people with disabilities that are involved with RPM."
24101739,Proton radiotherapy for pediatric central nervous system ependymoma: clinical outcomes for 70 patients,Shannon M Macdonald,"Background: Ependymoma is treated with maximal surgical resection and localized radiotherapy. Minimizing unnecessary exposure to radiation is of paramount importance for young children. Proton radiotherapy (PRT) spares healthy tissues outside the target region, but reports of clinical outcomes are scarce. We report outcomes for 70 patients treated with PRT for intracranial ependymoma. Methods: Seventy patients with localized ependymoma treated with involved-field PRT at the Massachusetts General Hospital between October 2000 and February 2011 were included. Results: Median age at diagnosis was 38 months (range, 3 mo-20 y). Nineteen (27%) patients had supratentorial ependymoma and 51(73%) had infratentorial ependymoma. Forty-six (66%) had gross total resection (GTR), and 24 (34%) had subtotal resection (STR). At a median follow-up of 46 months, 3-year local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 83%, 76%, and 95%, respectively. STR was significantly associated with worse progression-free survival (54% vs 88%, P = .001) and overall survival (90% vs 97% for GTR, P = .001). In a subset of patients (n = 14), mean intelligence was 108.5 at baseline and 111.3 after mean 2.05 years of follow-up. In a larger group of patients (n = 28), overall adaptive skills were 100.1 at baseline and 100.8 after 2.21 years of follow-up. Few patients developed evidence of growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, or hearing loss. Conclusion: Outcomes for children treated with PRT compare favorably with the literature. STR correlated with inferior outcome. The young age at diagnosis and the proximity of critical structures in patients with ependymoma make PRT an ideal radiation modality."
24101738,Neuropsychological functions and quality of life in survived patients with intracranial germ cell tumors after treatment,Shih-Yuan Liang,"Background: The notable survival chances of intracranial germ cell tumors (icGCTs) lead to a rising concern over long-term neurocognitive outcome. Yet, prior evidence related to this issue fails to provide a comprehensive examination of the effects of tumor location and radiotherapy. We attempt to explore their impacts on the neuropsychological functions and life quality in children with icGCT after multimodality treatments. Methods: A retrospective review of 56 patients diagnosed with icGCTs at age <20 and treated at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital was provided. Intelligence, memory, visual organization, attention, and executive function were assessed by neurocognitive tests; adaptation to life, emotional and behavioral changes, interpersonal relationships, and impact on the family were evaluated by parent-report instruments. Effects of tumor locations (germinomas and nongerminomatous malignant germ cell tumors in the pineal, suprasellar, and basal ganglia) and irradiation on these measurements were examined. Results: Patients with tumors in the basal ganglia region had lower full-scale IQs than those with tumors in the pineal or suprasellar regions. Subscores of intelligence scale and short-term retention of verbal and visual stimuli showed evident group differences, as did the quality of life and adaptive skills, particularly in psychosocial domains. Patients treated with whole-ventricular irradiation had better outcomes. Extensive irradiation field and high irradiation dosage influenced intellectual functions, concept crystallization, executive function, and memory. Conclusions: Tumor location and irradiation field/dosage appear to be the crucial factors related to certain neuropsychological, emotional, and behavioral dysfunctions that in turn alter the quality of life in children with icGCTs who survive after treatment."
24101628,Did tool-use evolve with enhanced physical cognitive abilities?,I Teschke,"The use and manufacture of tools have been considered to be cognitively demanding and thus a possible driving factor in the evolution of intelligence. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that enhanced physical cognitive abilities evolved in conjunction with the use of tools, by comparing the performance of naturally tool-using and non-tool-using species in a suite of physical and general learning tasks. We predicted that the habitually tool-using species, New Caledonian crows and Galápagos woodpecker finches, should outperform their non-tool-using relatives, the small tree finches and the carrion crows in a physical problem but not in general learning tasks. We only found a divergence in the predicted direction for corvids. That only one of our comparisons supports the predictions under this hypothesis might be attributable to different complexities of tool-use in the two tool-using species. A critical evaluation is offered of the conceptual and methodological problems inherent in comparative studies on tool-related cognitive abilities."
24099269,"Rationale, design and methods for a community-based study of clustering and cumulative effects of chronic disease processes and their effects on ageing: the Busselton healthy ageing study",Alan James,"Background: The global trend of increased life expectancy and increased prevalence of chronic and degenerative diseases will impact on health systems. To identify effective intervention and prevention strategies, greater understanding of the risk factors for and cumulative effects of chronic disease processes and their effects on function and quality of life is needed.The Busselton Healthy Ageing Study aims to enhance understanding of ageing by relating the clustering and interactions of common chronic conditions in adults to function. Longitudinal (3-5 yearly) follow-up is planned. Methods/design: Phase I (recruitment) is a cross-sectional community-based prospective cohort study involving up to 4,000 'Baby Boomers' (born from 1946 to 1964) living in the Busselton Shire, Western Australia. The study protocol involves a detailed, self-administered health and risk factor questionnaire and a range of physical assessments including body composition and bone density measurements, cardiovascular profiling (blood pressure, ECG and brachial pulse wave velocity), retinal photography, tonometry, auto-refraction, spirometry and bronchodilator responsiveness, skin allergy prick tests, sleep apnoea screening, tympanometry and audiometry, grip strength, mobility, balance and leg extensor strength. Cognitive function and reserve, semantic memory, and pre-morbid intelligence are assessed. Participants provide a fasting blood sample for assessment of lipids, blood glucose, C-reactive protein and renal and liver function, and RNA, DNA and serum are stored. Clinically relevant results are provided to all participants. The prevalence of risk factors, symptoms and diagnosed illness will be calculated and the burden of illness will be estimated based on the observed relationships and clustering of symptoms and illness within individuals. Risk factors for combinations of illness will be compared with those for single illnesses and the relation of combinations of illness and symptoms to cognitive and physical function will be estimated. Discussion: This study will enable a thorough characterization of multiple disease processes and their risk factors within a community-based sample of individuals to determine their singular, interactive and cumulative effects on ageing. The project will provide novel cross-sectional data and establish a cohort that will be used for longitudinal analyses of the genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that determine whether an individual ages well or with impairment."
24099142,WAIS-IV reliable digit span is no more accurate than age corrected scaled score as an indicator of invalid performance in a veteran sample undergoing evaluation for mTBI,Robert J Spencer,"Reliable Digit Span (RDS) is a measure of effort derived from the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler intelligence scales. Some authors have suggested that the age-corrected scaled score provides a more accurate measure of effort than RDS. This study examined the relative diagnostic accuracy of the traditional RDS, an extended RDS including the new Sequencing task from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV, and the age-corrected scaled score, relative to performance validity as determined by the Test of Memory Malingering. Data were collected from 138 Veterans seen in a traumatic brain injury clinic. The traditional RDS (≤ 7), revised RDS (≤ 11), and Digit Span age-corrected scaled score ( ≤ 6) had respective sensitivities of 39%, 39%, and 33%, and respective specificities of 82%, 89%, and 91%. Of these indices, revised RDS and the Digit Span age-corrected scaled score provide the most accurate measure of performance validity among the three measures."
24098964,Does dyadic coping mediate the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and marital quality?,Moshe Zeidner,"This study tested for the mediational effects of dyadic coping in the observed relationship between emotional intelligence, assessed both as ability and as trait, and quality of marital relations. We used a standard dyadic design involving 100 newlywed heterosexual couples who were assessed on EI measures along with measures of dyadic coping and perceived marital quality. Total dyadic coping, as well as dyadic coping of oneself and dyadic coping of partner, were observed to mediate the association between EI and marital quality. These data provide some support for the commonly held assumption that EI plays a role in marital relationships, as mediated by dyadic coping. However, whereas the individual appears to benefit from being emotionally intelligent, the benefit is not transmitted to the other partner in the relationship."
24096823,Application of machine learning algorithms for clinical predictive modeling: a data-mining approach in SCT,R Shouval,"Data collected from hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) centers are becoming more abundant and complex owing to the formation of organized registries and incorporation of biological data. Typically, conventional statistical methods are used for the development of outcome prediction models and risk scores. However, these analyses carry inherent properties limiting their ability to cope with large data sets with multiple variables and samples. Machine learning (ML), a field stemming from artificial intelligence, is part of a wider approach for data analysis termed data mining (DM). It enables prediction in complex data scenarios, familiar to practitioners and researchers. Technological and commercial applications are all around us, gradually entering clinical research. In the following review, we would like to expose hematologists and stem cell transplanters to the concepts, clinical applications, strengths and limitations of such methods and discuss current research in HSCT. The aim of this review is to encourage utilization of the ML and DM techniques in the field of HSCT, including prediction of transplantation outcome and donor selection."
24096533,Biomarkers in autism spectrum disorder: the old and the new,Barbara Ruggeri,"Rationale: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with onset during early childhood and typically a life-long course. The majority of ASD cases stems from complex, 'multiple-hit', oligogenic/polygenic underpinnings involving several loci and possibly gene-environment interactions. These multiple layers of complexity spur interest into the identification of biomarkers able to define biologically homogeneous subgroups, predict autism risk prior to the onset of behavioural abnormalities, aid early diagnoses, predict the developmental trajectory of ASD children, predict response to treatment and identify children at risk for severe adverse reactions to psychoactive drugs. Objectives: The present paper reviews (a) similarities and differences between the concepts of 'biomarker' and 'endophenotype', (b) established biomarkers and endophenotypes in autism research (biochemical, morphological, hormonal, immunological, neurophysiological and neuroanatomical, neuropsychological, behavioural), (c) -omics approaches towards the discovery of novel biomarker panels for ASD, (d) bioresource infrastructures and (e) data management for biomarker research in autism. Results: Known biomarkers, such as abnormal blood levels of serotonin, oxytocin, melatonin, immune cytokines and lymphocyte subtypes, multiple neuropsychological, electrophysiological and brain imaging parameters, will eventually merge with novel biomarkers identified using unbiased genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic methods, to generate multimarker panels. Bioresource infrastructures, data management and data analysis using artificial intelligence networks will be instrumental in supporting efforts to identify these biomarker panels. Conclusions: Biomarker research has great heuristic potential in targeting autism diagnosis and treatment."
24096204,Associations and propositions: the case for a dual-process account of learning in humans,I P L McLaren,"We review evidence that supports the conclusion that people can and do learn in two distinct ways - one associative, the other propositional. No one disputes that we solve problems by testing hypotheses and inducing underlying rules, so the issue amounts to deciding whether there is evidence that we (and other animals) also rely on a simpler, associative system, that detects the frequency of occurrence of different events in our environment and the contingencies between them. There is neuroscientific evidence that associative learning occurs in at least some animals (e.g., Aplysia californica), so it must be the case that associative learning has evolved. Since both associative and propositional theories can in principle account for many instances of successful learning, the problem is then to show that there are at least some cases where the two classes of theory predict different outcomes. We offer a demonstration of cue competition effects in humans under incidental conditions as evidence against the argument that all such effects are based on cognitive inference. The latter supposition would imply that if the necessary information is unavailable to inference then no cue competition should occur. We then discuss the case of unblocking by reinforcer omission, where associative theory predicts an irrational solution to the problem, and consider the phenomenon of the Perruchet effect, in which conscious expectancy and conditioned response dissociate. Further discussion makes use of evidence that people will sometimes provide one solution to a problem when it is presented to them in summary form, and another when they are presented in rapid succession with trial-by trial information. We also demonstrate that people trained on a discrimination may show a peak shift (predicted by associative theory), but given the time and opportunity to detect the relationships between S+ and S-, show rule-based behavior instead. Finally, we conclude by presenting evidence that research on individual differences suggests that variation in intelligence and explicit problem solving ability are quite unrelated to variation in implicit (associative) learning, and briefly consider the computational implications of our argument, by asking how both associative and propositional processes can be accommodated within a single framework for cognition."
24095776,"Siblings with opposite chromosome constitutions, dup(2q)/del(7q) and del(2q)/dup(7q)",Sung Han Shim,"Chromosome 7q36 microdeletion syndrome is a rare genomic disorder characterized by underdevelopment of the brain, microcephaly, anomalies of the sex organs, and language problems. Developmental delay, intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorders, BDMR syndrome, and unusual facial morphology are the key features of the chromosome 2q37 microdeletion syndrome. A genetic screening for two brothers with global developmental delay using high-resolution chromosomal analysis and subtelomeric multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification revealed subtelomeric rearrangements on the same sites of 2q37.2 and 7q35, with reversed deletion and duplication. Both of them showed dysmorphic facial features, severe disability of physical and intellectual development, and abnormal genitalia with differential abnormalities in their phenotypes. The family did not have abnormal genetic phenotypes. According to the genetic analysis of their parents, adjacent-1 segregation from their mother's was suggested as a mechanism of their gene mutation. By comparing the phenotypes of our patients with previous reports on similar patients, we tried to obtain the information of related genes and their chromosomal locations."
24094277,On applying cognitive psychology,Alan Baddeley,"Recent attempts to assess the practical impact of scientific research prompted my own reflections on over 40 years worth of combining basic and applied cognitive psychology. Examples are drawn principally from the study of memory disorders, but also include applications to the assessment of attention, reading, and intelligence. The most striking conclusion concerns the many years it typically takes to go from an initial study, to the final practical outcome. Although the complexity and sheer timescale involved make external evaluation problematic, the combination of practical satisfaction and theoretical stimulation make the attempt to combine basic and applied research very rewarding."
24094101,The structure of cognition: attentional episodes in mind and brain,John Duncan,"Cognition is organized in a structured series of attentional episodes, allowing complex problems to be addressed through solution of simpler subproblems. A ""multiple-demand"" (MD) system of frontal and parietal cortex is active in many different kinds of tasks, and using data from neuroimaging, electrophysiology, neuropsychology, and cognitive studies of intelligence, I propose a core role for MD regions in assembly of the attentional episode. Monkey and human data show dynamic neural coding of attended information across multiple MD regions, with rapid communication within and between regions. Neuropsychological and imaging data link MD function to fluid intelligence, explaining some but not all ""executive"" deficits after frontal lobe lesions. Cognitive studies link fluid intelligence to goal neglect, and the problem of dividing complex task requirements into focused parts. Like the innate releasing mechanism of ethology, I suggest that construction of the attentional episode provides a core organizational principle for complex, adaptive cognition."
24091548,Working memory training may increase working memory capacity but not fluid intelligence,Tyler L Harrison,"Working memory is a critical element of complex cognition, particularly under conditions of distraction and interference. Measures of working memory capacity correlate positively with many measures of real-world cognition, including fluid intelligence. There have been numerous attempts to use training procedures to increase working memory capacity and thereby performance on the real-world tasks that rely on working memory capacity. In the study reported here, we demonstrated that training on complex working memory span tasks leads to improvement on similar tasks with different materials but that such training does not generalize to measures of fluid intelligence."
24090777,Preschool behavioral problems in children prenatally exposed to antiepileptic drugs - a follow-up study,D Kjaer,"We studied the association between maternal epilepsy, antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment, and behavioral problems in preschool children. In the Danish National Birth Cohort, we identified 4- to 5-year-old children whose mothers had epilepsy and received AED treatment (n=133) or not (n=304) during pregnancy and compared them with randomly selected children whose mothers did not have epilepsy (n=1193). The children's behavioral problems were assessed by the use of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Children prenatally exposed to AEDs more often had an abnormal total SDQ score as compared with children of women without epilepsy (odds ratio (OR)=4.8 (95% CI: 1.9-12.1)) and as compared with children of women with epilepsy who were not treated with AEDs during their pregnancy (OR=4.0 (95% CI: 1.3-12.8)). In conclusion, prenatal AED exposure may increase the risk of behavioral problems in preschool children even after adjustments for potential confounders and maternal epilepsy."
24090706,Fluctuations in phenylalanine concentrations in phenylketonuria: a review of possible relationships with outcomes,Maureen Cleary,"Fluctuations in blood phenylalanine concentrations may be an important determinant of intellectual outcome in patients with early and continuously treated phenylketonuria (PKU). This review evaluates the studies on phenylalanine fluctuations, factors affecting fluctuations, and if stabilizing phenylalanine concentrations affects outcomes, particularly neurocognitive outcome. Electronic literature searches of Embase and PubMed were performed for English-language publications, and the bibliographies of identified publications were also searched. In patients with PKU, phenylalanine concentrations are highest in the morning. Factors that can affect phenylalanine fluctuations include age, diet, timing and dosing of protein substitute and energy intake, dietary adherence, phenylalanine hydroxylase genotype, changes in dietary phenylalanine intake and protein metabolism, illness, and growth rate. Even distribution of phenylalanine-free protein substitute intake throughout 24h may reduce blood phenylalanine fluctuations. Patients responsive to and treated with 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin seem to have less fluctuation in their blood phenylalanine concentrations than controls. An increase in blood phenylalanine concentration may result in increased brain and cerebrospinal fluid phenylalanine concentrations within hours. Although some evidence suggests that stabilization of blood phenylalanine concentrations may have benefits in patients with PKU, more studies are needed to distinguish the effects of blood phenylalanine fluctuations from those of poor metabolic control."
24090588,"Simvastatin for cognitive deficits and behavioural problems in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1-SIMCODA): a randomised, placebo-controlled trial",Thijs van der Vaart,"Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a common genetic disorder characterised by neurocutaneous manifestations and cognitive and behavioural problems. Statins were shown to reduce analogous learning deficits in a mouse model of the disease, but a short-term trial in humans was inconclusive. We aimed to assess the use of simvastatin for the improvement of cognitive and behavioural deficits in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 for 12 months. Methods: In this randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited children with genetically confirmed neurofibromatosis type 1 aged 8-16 years from two national referral centres in the Netherlands and Belgium. Those with symptomatic CNS abnormalities or on neurotropic medication, including stimulants, were excluded. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computer-generated, permuted-block list to simvastatin (10 mg per day in month 1, 20 mg per day in month 2, and 20-40 mg per day in months 3-12) or placebo for 12 months. Investigators, participants, and parents were masked to treatment assignment. Primary outcome measures were full-scale intelligence (Wechsler intelligence scale for children), attention problems (child behaviour checklist, parent-rated [CBCL]), and internalising behavioural problems (CBCL). We did intention-to-treat analyses (of all patients who had outcome data) using linear regression of the 12 month outcome scores, adjusted for baseline performance. This trial is registered with the Netherlands Trial Register, number NTR2150. Findings: We randomly assigned 84 children to a treatment group (43 to simvastatin, 41 to placebo) between March 9, 2010, and March 6, 2012. We did not assess outcomes in two patients in the placebo group because they needed additional drug therapy. Simvastatin for 12 months had no effect on full-scale intelligence (treatment effect compared with placebo -1·3 IQ points [95% CI -3·8 to 1·3]; p=0·33), attention problems (-1·6 T-score points [-4·3 to 1·0]; p=0·23), and internalising behavioural problems (-0·1 T-score points [-3·3 to 3·1]; p=0·96). 38 (88%) of 43 patients on simvastatin and 39 (95%) of 41 patients on placebo reported adverse events, which were serious in two and four patients, respectively. Interpretation: 12 month simvastatin treatment did not ameliorate cognitive deficits or behavioural problems in children with neurofibromatosis type 1.

24089423,Group cognitive behavioural therapy and group recreational activity for adults with autism spectrum disorders: a preliminary randomized controlled trial,Eva Hesselmark,"Although adults with autism spectrum disorder are an increasingly identified patient population, few treatment options are available. This preliminary randomized controlled open trial with a parallel design developed two group interventions for adults with autism spectrum disorders and intelligence within the normal range: cognitive behavioural therapy and recreational activity. Both interventions comprised 36 weekly 3-h sessions led by two therapists in groups of 6-8 patients. A total of 68 psychiatric patients with autism spectrum disorders participated in the study. Outcome measures were Quality of Life Inventory, Sense of Coherence Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and an exploratory analysis on measures of psychiatric health. Participants in both treatment conditions reported an increased quality of life at post-treatment (d = 0.39, p < 0.001), with no difference between interventions. No amelioration of psychiatric symptoms was observed. The dropout rate was lower with cognitive behavioural therapy than with recreational activity, and participants in cognitive behavioural therapy rated themselves as more generally improved, as well as more improved regarding expression of needs and understanding of difficulties. Both interventions appear to be promising treatment options for adults with autism spectrum disorder. The interventions' similar efficacy may be due to the common elements, structure and group setting. Cognitive behavioural therapy may be additionally beneficial in terms of increasing specific skills and minimizing dropout."
24089369,Increased coherence of white matter fiber tract organization in adults with Asperger syndrome: a diffusion tensor imaging study,Ulrika Roine,"To investigate whether there are global white matter (WM) differences between autistic and healthy adults, we performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 14 male adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) and 19 gender-, age-, and intelligence quotient-matched controls. We focused on individuals with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD), AS, to decrease heterogeneity caused by large variation in the cognitive profile. Previous DTI studies of ASD have mainly focused on finding local changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), two indexes used to characterize microstructural properties of WM. Although the local or voxel-based approaches may be able to provide detailed information in terms of location of the observed differences, such results are known to be highly sensitive to partial volume effects, registration errors, or placement of the regions of interest. Therefore, we performed global histogram analyses of (a) whole-brain tractography results and (b) skeletonized WM masks. In addition to the FA and MD, the planar diffusion coefficient (CP) was computed as it can provide more specific information of the complexity of the neural structure. Our main finding indicated that adults with AS had higher mean FA values than controls. A less complex neural structure in adults with AS could have explained the results, but no significant difference in CP was found. Our results suggest that there are global abnormalities in the WM tissue of adults with AS."
24089322,Multiple-choice vocabulary intelligence test MWT in schizophrenia: valid measure of premorbid intelligence?],Andreas Wittorf,"Objective: The multiple-choice vocabulary intelligence test MWT (Mehrfachwahl-Wortschatz-Intelligenztest) as a measure of premorbid IQ is widely used in clinical practice and research in Germany. The study examined whether the MWT is actually insensitive to brain dysfunction and psychopathology in patients with schizophrenia. Method: 81 post-acute patients with schizophrenia and 27 matched healthy controls completed the MWT at two points in time. At baseline, we further applied a neuropsychological test battery and a psychopathology rating. Results: The multiple linear regression analysis showed that the MWT-IQ of patients is significantly confounded by neuropsychological dysfunctions and psychopathology. The repeated measurement ANOVA pointed to a significant recovery effect of the MWT-IQ during clinical remission in the patient group. Conclusion: The results question the validity of the MWT as a measure of premorbid IQ in schizophrenia."
24088177,Assessment of neuropsychological late effects in survivors of childhood leukemia,Ayşe İpek Kalafatçılar,"The neurologic dysfunctions caused by treatment may affect health and quality of life in survivors of childhood leukemia. The objective of this study was to identify the neuropsychological late effects of leukemia treatment to provide an assessment about the degree and incidence of these late effects. Neurological and ophtalmological examination, cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), auditory and neurocognitive tests, and questionnaires of quality of life were performed to 44 acute leukemia survivors at least 5 years after diagnosis. Median time since completion of chemotherapy was 7.5 years (2-18) and median age at the time of the study was 16.4 years (8-31). At least one or more late effects detected by physical examination (PE), neurological tests, or neurocognitive tests encountered in 80% of the patients, and 64% of the patients specified at least one complaint in the quality of life questionnaire. MRI revealed pathological findings in 18% and electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities were present in 9% of the patients. Evaluation of total intelligence scores revealed that 30% of patients' IQ scores were <80 and 70% of the patients' scores demonstrated neurocognitive dysfunctions. The patients >6 years at the time of diagnosis were found to have more psychological problems and higher rates of smoking and alcohol consumption. The most frequent complaint was headache and the most common problem in school was denoted as difficulty in concentration. Our study demonstrated that most of the survivors of childhood leukemia are at risk of developing neuropsycological late effects."
24088069,Academic performance and intelligence scores of primary school-aged children with sickle cell anemia,Osita Ezenwosu,"Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are faced with complications which may interfere with their educational activities including academic performance. Reports on their academic performance are mainly from developed countries and the results have been inconsistent. This study aimed to determine the academic performance of primary school-aged children with SCA in Nigeria and compare findings with a group of controls. Ninety children with SCA aged 5-11 years were consecutively recruited at the SCA clinic of UNTH Enugu and their age- and sex-matched normal classmates were enrolled as controls. Academic performance of the children with SCA was studied using the overall scores achieved in the three term examinations in the preceding academic year (2009/2010), while their intelligence quotient (IQ) was determined using the Draw-A-Person Test. The findings were compared with that of 90 controls. The mean overall academic score of the children with SCA of 62.71 ± 19.43% was similar to 67.47 ± 16.42% in the controls (P = .077). However, a significantly higher number of children with SCA (32.2% vs. 16.7% of the controls; P = .015) scored below 50%, thus, had poor performance. The mean IQ of the subjects (91.41 ±16.61%) was similar to that of the controls (95.56 ±17.31%, P = .103). However, more SCA patients had lower IQ scores than controls though not statistically significant (P = 0.083). The overall academic performance of children with SCA, therefore, compares favorably with that of controls although there is a higher prevalence of poor performance among them."
24088010,"Therapeutic horse riding improves cognition, mood arousal, and ambulation in children with dyspraxia",Caren E Hession,"Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of the physical motion of a horse (riding therapy) combined with the audiovisual perception of this motion on a group of children with dyspraxia in terms of cognition, mood arousal, and gait variability. Design: The study design was a pretest/post-test. Settings/location: The study was conducted at the Fettercairn Youth Horse Project, Fettercairn, Tallaght, Dublin. Subjects: Forty (40) children ranging from 6 to 15 years of age with a primary diagnosis of dyspraxia were the study subjects. Interventions: Children meeting inclusion criteria participated in six 30-minute horse-riding sessions and two 30-minute audiovisual screening sessions. Outcome measures: A Standard Progressive Matrices test (also known as the Ravens test) was used to measure aspects of general intelligence. A Childhood Depression Inventory (CDI) questionnaire was used to assess cognitive, affective, and behavioral signs of depression. A GAITRite Pressure Mapping System analyzed foot function and gait variability by measuring single and double support, cycle time, cadence, toe in/out, and stride length. Results: Significant improvements were evident on the Ravens test and the CDI by the end of the study period. The amount of both single and double support required while completing the walking task also was significantly reduced. Improvements were visible on toe in/out values, cycle time, and cadence. Changes in stride length did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: These findings support the theory that riding therapy and/or the perception of beat-based rhythms, as experienced by the rider on the horse, stimulates cognition, mood, and gait parameters. In addition, the data also pointed to the potential value of an audiovisual approach to equine therapy."
24084038,The stability of intelligence from age 11 to age 90 years: the Lothian birth cohort of 1921,Ian J Deary,"As a foundation for studies of human cognitive aging, it is important to know the stability of individual differences in cognitive ability across the life course. Few studies of cognitive ability have tested the same individuals in youth and old age. We examined the stability and concurrent and predictive validity of individual differences in the same intelligence test administered to the same individuals (the Lothian Birth Cohort of 1921, N = 106) at ages 11 and 90 years. The correlation of Moray House Test scores between age 11 and age 90 was .54 (.67 when corrected for range restriction). This is a valuable foundation for estimating the extent to which cognitive-ability differences in very old age are accounted for by the lifelong stable trait and by the causes of cognitive change across the life course. Moray House Test scores showed strong concurrent and predictive validity with ""gold standard"" cognitive tests at ages 11 and 90."
24083565,Intellectual ability as a predictor of performance on the Wisconsin Card-Sorting Test,Mark K Tanabe,"The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between intelligence and executive functioning in youth. More specifically, the authors hypothesized that there would be a positive correlation between scores on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition General Ability Index (GAI) and understanding of sorting principles as measured by percent conceptual-level responses on the Wisconsin Card-Sorting Test (WCST). One hundred eighty-five children and adolescents completed neuropsychological evaluations. Results revealed a curvilinear regression with bright youth (GAI = 115-129) and gifted youth (GAI ≥130) performing better than average youth (GAI = 90-114) and no difference in performance between bright and gifted youth. Additionally, post-hoc analyses revealed intelligence in children 5 to 8 years of age and 12 to 16 years of age did not significantly predict percent conceptual-level responses, while intelligence predicted more than 19% of the variance in percent conceptual-level responses for children ages 9 to 11 years old. Findings revealed new evidence about the role of intellectual ability in executive functioning among different age ranges and have important implications for psychologists, caregivers, educators, and other professionals working with this population."
24083290,The relationship between emotional intelligence and academic stress in students of medical sciences,Mohammad Reza Miri,"Background and aim: Emotional intelligence (EI) theory provides a view about predicting effective factors in people's lives whether in education or profession. According to earlier studies, people who have higher emotional skills are more successful in many of life aspects :e.g., reaction to stress and controlling stress situations. Since students are the future of society, this study was carried out to evaluate the relationship between EI and education stress in the students of Birjand University of Medical Sciences (BUMS). Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study, 260 students were selected by proportional sampling in four faculties: Medicine, Nursing and Midwifery, Paramedical Sciences, and Health. Data were collected using two questionnaires: The standardized EI Shering's (33 questions, five domains) and the Student-Life Stress Inventory (57 questions, nine domains). The obtained data were analyzed by independent t-test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and linear regression at the significant level of α = 0.05. Results: Totally, 65.8% of participants were females and 31.1% were males. The educational level of the participants included Associate's degree (44.6%) Bachelor's degree in science (31.2%), and medical science (23.1%). There was no significant correlation between EI scores and educational stress in students. But there was a significant relationship between EI with sex (P = 0.02) and mean of EI scores with three domains of academic stress: Personal favorites (P = 0.004), reaction to stressors (P = 0.002), and performance in stressful situations (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Although EI growth in different individuals can promote their success, it cannot decrease academic stress by itself which was particularly significant in females. Therefore, other causes of stress such as individual differences must be taken into consideration."
24083109,Comparison result of inversion of gravity data of a fault by particle swarm optimization and Levenberg-Marquardt methods,Reza Toushmalani,"The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of two methods for gravity inversion of a fault. First method [Particle swarm optimization (PSO)] is a heuristic global optimization method and also an optimization algorithm, which is based on swarm intelligence. It comes from the research on the bird and fish flock movement behavior. Second method [The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LM)] is an approximation to the Newton method used also for training ANNs. In this paper first we discussed the gravity field of a fault, then describes the algorithms of PSO and LM And presents application of Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, and a particle swarm algorithm in solving inverse problem of a fault. Most importantly the parameters for the algorithms are given for the individual tests. Inverse solution reveals that fault model parameters are agree quite well with the known results. A more agreement has been found between the predicted model anomaly and the observed gravity anomaly in PSO method rather than LM method."
24080904,Urinary incontinence in children with special needs,Alexander von Gontard,"Nocturnal enuresis, daytime urinary incontinence, lower urinary tract symptoms and faecal incontinence are more common in children with special needs than in typically developing children. Children with intellectual disability, which can be attributed to a range of causes, are particularly affected. Indeed, the epidemiological and clinical studies conducted to date show clear associations that children with special needs have higher rates of urinary (and faecal) incontinence than children without development, physical or cognitive impairments. For example, low intelligence quotient (IQ)-associated physical disability and conditions such as Fragile X and Rett syndromes increase the risk for incontinence, which can persist into adulthood if left untreated. Although the association of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and incontinence has been shown in many studies, further research is needed on other specific disorders, such as autism. As many children are not receiving adequate care, specific multimodal treatments based on rigorous assessment of the incontinence, underlying condition and associated comorbid disorders should be actively offered."
24080019,Electrophysiological evidence of atypical processing underlying mental set shifting in ecstasy polydrug and polydrug users,Carl A Roberts,"Executive functioning deficits are reported in ecstasy users. However research into mental set switching has been equivocal, with behavioral studies suggesting the function is preserved. The current study sought to address the issue of switching deficits in ecstasy users by combining behavioral performance with electrophysiological correlates (electroencephalography; EEG). Twenty ecstasy polydrug users, 20 nonecstasy polydrug users, and 20 drug naive controls were recruited. Participants completed questionnaires about their drug use, sleep quality, fluid intelligence, and current mood state. Each participant completed a mental set switching task (the number-letter task) while EEG measures were recorded. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no between-group differences on performance of the task; however a regression suggested that ecstasy use was a significant predictor for performance, after controlling for cannabis use. Mixed ANOVA revealed a significant effect of group on the P3, with significant differences between both drug groups and naives. There was also an interaction between electrode and group on the P2 component, with ecstasy users differing from both other groups. On the P3 component the results suggest a reduction in positivity at parieto-occipital electrodes for drug users compared to controls. Furthermore a significant increase in negativity in ecstasy users compared to control groups could be observed in several occipito-parietal electrodes at an N2 component as well as observable atypicalities in early processing (P2) displayed by ecstasy users and polydrug controls. The present study provides evidence of atypical processing of attentional shifting in ecstasy and polydrug users. Deficits in this executive function could reflect cognitive inflexibility and paucity of rapid behavioral adjustment, which may be problematic in real world situations."
24079993,Examining neural plasticity and cognitive benefit through the unique lens of musical training,Sylvain Moreno,"Training programs aimed to alleviate or improve auditory-cognitive abilities have either experienced mixed success or remain to be fully validated. The limited benefits of such regimens are largely attributable to our weak understanding of (i) how (and which) interventions provide the most robust and long lasting improvements to cognitive and perceptual abilities and (ii) how the neural mechanisms which underlie such abilities are positively modified by certain activities and experience. Recent studies indicate that music training provides robust, long-lasting biological benefits to auditory function. Importantly, the behavioral advantages conferred by musical experience extend beyond simple enhancements to perceptual abilities and even impact non-auditory functions necessary for higher-order aspects of cognition (e.g., working memory, intelligence). Collectively, preliminary findings indicate that alternative forms of arts engagement (e.g., visual arts training) may not yield such widespread enhancements, suggesting that music expertise uniquely taps and refines a hierarchy of brain networks subserving a variety of auditory as well as domain-general cognitive mechanisms. We infer that transfer from specific music experience to broad cognitive benefit might be mediated by the degree to which a listener's musical training tunes lower- (e.g., perceptual) and higher-order executive functions, and the coordination between these processes. Ultimately, understanding the broad impact of music on the brain will not only provide a more holistic picture of auditory processing and plasticity, but may help inform and tailor remediation and training programs designed to improve perceptual and cognitive benefits in human listeners."
24079964,A new measure for gene expression biclustering based on non-parametric correlation,Jose L Flores,"Background: One of the emerging techniques for performing the analysis of the DNA microarray data known as biclustering is the search of subsets of genes and conditions which are coherently expressed. These subgroups provide clues about the main biological processes. Until now, different approaches to this problem have been proposed. Most of them use the mean squared residue as quality measure but relevant and interesting patterns can not be detected such as shifting, or scaling patterns. Furthermore, recent papers show that there exist new coherence patterns involved in different kinds of cancer and tumors such as inverse relationships between genes which can not be captured. Results: The proposed measure is called Spearman's biclustering measure (SBM) which performs an estimation of the quality of a bicluster based on the non-linear correlation among genes and conditions simultaneously. The search of biclusters is performed by using a evolutionary technique called estimation of distribution algorithms which uses the SBM measure as fitness function. This approach has been examined from different points of view by using artificial and real microarrays. The assessment process has involved the use of quality indexes, a set of bicluster patterns of reference including new patterns and a set of statistical tests. It has been also examined the performance using real microarrays and comparing to different algorithmic approaches such as Bimax, CC, OPSM, Plaid and xMotifs. Conclusions: SBM shows several advantages such as the ability to recognize more complex coherence patterns such as shifting, scaling and inversion and the capability to selectively marginalize genes and conditions depending on the statistical significance."
24079958,Factorial validity and measurement invariance across intelligence levels and gender of the overexcitabilities questionnaire-II (OEQ-II),Wim Van den Broeck,"The concept of overexcitability, derived from Dabrowski's theory of personality development, offers a promising approach for the study of the developmental dynamics of giftedness. The present study aimed at (a) examining the factorial structure of the Overexcitabilities Questionnaire-II scores (OEQ-II) and (b) testing measurement invariance of these scores across intelligence and gender. A sample of 641 Dutch-speaking adolescents from 11 to 15 years old, 363 girls and 278 boys, participated in this study. Results showed that a model without cross-loadings did not fit the data well (using confirmatory factor analysis), whereas a factor model in which all cross-loadings were included yielded fit statistics that were in support of the factorial structure of the OEQ-II scores (using exploratory structural equation modeling). Furthermore, our findings supported the assumption of (partial) strict measurement invariance of the OEQ-II scores across intelligence levels and across gender. Such levels of measurement invariance allow valid comparisons between factor means and factor relationships across groups. In particular, the gifted group scored significantly higher on intellectual and sensual overexcitability (OE) than the nongifted group, girls scored higher on emotional and sensual OE than boys, and boys scored higher on intellectual and psychomotor OE than girls."
24079535,WISC-IV unusual digit span performance in a sample of adolescents with learning disabilities,Allyson G Harrison,"Accurate identification of symptom magnification is essential when determining whether or not obtained test data are valid or interpretable. Apart from using freestanding symptom validity tests, many researchers encourage use of embedded measures of test-related motivation, including ones derived from the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler scales. Such embedded measures are based on identification of performance patterns that are implausible if the test taker is investing full effort; however, it is unclear whether or not persons with preexisting cognitive difficulties such as specific learning disabilities (LD) might be falsely accused of poor test motivation due to actual but impaired working-memory skills. This study examined the specificity of such measures by reviewing performance of 86 adolescents with LDs on three measures embedded in the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition-namely, Digit Span (DS), Vocabulary-DS differences, and Reliable Digit Span (RDS) scores. Results indicate that while RDS is likely insensitive to impairments associated with LD, other DS measures may have an unacceptably high false-positive rate, especially if Canadian normative data are used to calculate scores."
26060627,The Effectiveness of Emotional Intelligence Training on the Mental Health of Male Deaf Students,Masoume Pourmohamadreza-Tajrishi,"Background: Deafness is a common neural-sensory impairment which leads to lower life quality, withdrawal, social activities reduction, and rejection feeling. So, it is important to plan suitable training programs for mental health promotion of deaf children. Emotional intelligence training is one of these programs. The present study was aimed to determine the effectiveness of emotional intelligence training on the mental health of deaf students. Methods: In this semi-experimental study with pretest and posttest design, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was completed in 40 randomly selected boy deaf students with mean age of (12.48) years old before and after the intervention. The aim of the questionnaire was obtaining information of somatic symptoms, anxiety, social dysfunction, and depression as well as general health. The students were assigned in experimental and control group randomly and in equal. Experimental group participated in 12 sessions (each session lasts for 50 minutes; twice a week) and were trained by emotional intelligence program, but control group did not. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used for analyzing the data. Results: There was a significant difference (P<0.001) between experimental and control group according to somatic symptoms, anxiety, social dysfunction, depression and general health as a whole after participation in intervention sessions. Conclusion: There was a significant decrease in somatic symptoms, anxiety, social dysfunction, depression and increase in general health of experimental group. Our findings showed that emotional intelligence training program led to promote of general health of boy deaf students."
25796718,Cybersurgery: human-machine integration for surgery of the future],Jacques Marescaux,"The concept whereby human-machine collaboration can enhance surgical performance is briefly reviewed in this editorial. Implementation of computer and robotic technologies in the operating room may enhance the safety, efficacy and precision of the surgical procedure and facilitate minimally invasive approaches. The coming cybernetic revolution in surgery is no longer science fiction: a surgical robot equipped with image recognition, specific algorithms and artificial intelligence has the potential replace surgeons and to perform complex procedures autonomously."
25628709,"The relationship of general health, hardiness and spiritual intelligence relationship in Iranian nurses",Fatemeh Akbarizadeh,"Objective: Nursing is one of the stressful jobs that affect nurse's well-being. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between spiritual intelligence, hardiness and well-being among Iranian nurses. Methods: Samples of this cross- sectional study selected by Randomized stratified sampling, 125 nurses who have been working in different wards of Bushehr university hospitals. Data were collected using spiritual intelligence, hardiness, well-being and demographic characteristics questionnaires. Correlation, t-test, ANOVA, Tukey and regression analysis were applied. Results: The results revealed a significant relationship between spiritual intelligence and hardiness, spiritual intelligence and well-being, Hardiness and well-being. It also showed that among the demographic characteristics (age, gender, working ward, marital status, job experiences, and education) working ward significantly correlated with spiritual intelligence. Conclusion: Improvement of spiritual intelligence and reinforcement of hardiness could help increase the well-being of nurses."
24078577,Diagnosis and treatment of isolated methylmalonic acidemia],Lian-shu Han,"Objective: To explore the clinical feature, therapeutic effect and prognosis of isolated methylmalonic acidemia. Methods: The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome of 40 patients were retrospectively analyzed. The main treatment was a low-protein diet supplemented with L-carnitine and special milk free of leucine, valine, threonine and methionine. Vitamin B12 was also given to cobalamin responders. The patients were followed up every 1-3 months. Results: Mutations in the MUT gene were identified in 30 of 33 patients who had accepted DNA testing. Thirty cases were treated and followed up regularly for from 1 month to 8 years. Eight cases had died, 8 had developed normal intelligence, among whom 4 from newborn screening were asymptomatic. Psychomotor developmental delay and mental retardation were present in 14 cases. The propionylcarnitine level, ratio of propionylcarnitine/acetylcarnitine in blood, methylmalonic acid and methylcitric acid levels in urine have decreased significantly, with the median values reduced respectively from 24.15 (7.92-81.02) μmol/L, 1.08 (0.38-6.01), 705.34 (113.79-3078.60) and 7.71 (0.52-128.21) to 10.50 (3.00-30.92) μmol/L, 0.63 (0.25-2.89), 166.23 (22.40-3322.21) and 3.96 (0.94-119.13) (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The prognosis of isolated methylmalonic acidemia may be predicted with the enzymatic subgroup, age at onset and cobalamin responsiveness. Outcome is unfavorable in neonatal patients and those who were non-responsive to cobalamin."
24077575,Vitamin D and long-term memory in multiple sclerosis,Nancy S Koven,"Background and objective: Memory disturbance is a frequent cognitive complaint by patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent dementia research suggests a beneficial role for vitamin D in long-term memory functioning. While data suggest ameliorative effects of vitamin D for the physical impairments of MS, it is unknown whether vitamin D can benefit the cognitive sequelae. We examined the relationship between serum levels of vitamin D and performance on verbal and nonverbal tests of long-term memory in patients with MS. Methods: A sample of 35 adults with relapsing-remitting MS completed cognitive testing and a vitamin D serum (25[OH]D) assay. Memory assessment used clinically established neuropsychological tests with multiple testing formats to determine whether vitamin D level was associated with memory during conditions of varying retrieval demands. Intellectual functioning and mood were also assessed to control for potential confounds. Results: Vitamin D level was positively associated with performance on immediate and delayed recall trials of the Rey Complex Figure Test, effects that held after controlling for intelligence and disease duration. Vitamin D level was not associated with mood, intelligence, or verbal memory performance on the California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition. Conclusions: Higher vitamin D level was associated with better nonverbal long-term memory performance in MS, particularly in conditions when no aid was given to help retrieval. These results supplement the literature on the neuroprotective effects of vitamin D and suggest that vitamin D is a worthwhile adjunct treatment for MS."
24077491,Normative study of the Boston naming test in 7-year-old Japanese children],Nozomi Tatsuta,"Objectives: The Boston Naming Test (BNT) has been used to assess the language development of children in many epidemiology studies, and its usefulness is confirmed. The BNT consists of 60 black and white line drawings of objects and animals. There are no normative data available for this test for Japanese children. The purpose of this study was to collect normative information in Japan and to examine the correlation between the score of the BNT and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children third edition (WISC-III). Methods: The BNT was translated into Japanese and administered in children registered to the birth cohort of the Tohoku Study of Child Development at the age of 84 months. The participants for analysis in this study were 449 children (237 boys, 212 girls). Results: There were four items with percentage scores below 1%; Igloo, Knocker, Muzzle, and Yoke. Many Japanese children could answer 'abacus' and 'compass', which are difficult for US children. Although the score of the BNT correlated with IQ of the WISC-III (p<0.001), as compared with the previous studies, the correlation coefficient was low. Conclusions: The BNT is quick and easy to use and valuable for researchers in evaluating language ability in children. Since the BNT was developed in the United States, the cultural values of that country are reflected in the BNT score. This implies that the BNT should be modified to fit Japanese population."
24077481,Cognitive processes and functions in patients with type 2 diabetes in comparison to pre-diabetic patients,Marzieh Nazaribadie,"Background: Type 2 diabetes is an important risk factor for cognitive decline in diabetic patients. The main goal of this study was the assessment of memory, attention and visuospatial ability dysfunctions in patients with type 2 diabetes in comparison to pre-diabetic patients and normal subjects in Endocrine and Metabolism Center of Isfahan City from April 2011 to July 2011. Methods: The sample comprised of 32 patients with type 2 diabetes, 28 pre-diabetic patients and 30 healthy individuals. Memory, attention and visuospatial ability were assessed by Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) and sub tests of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-revised (WAIS-R). Results: The pair wise comparisons of cognitive functions among three groups, suggesting a significant difference between diabetic and normal groups in PASAT3"". PASAT2"", RCFT (recall trial) and Symbol coding (P=0.003, P=0.009, P=0.010, and P<0.001, respectively). But there was no difference in copy trial of RCFT and block design between two groups (P=0.170, P=0.490). There was significant difference between pre-diabetic group and normal group in recall trial of RCFT (P=0.020), as well as significant difference between diabetes type 2 and pre-diabetic group in symbol coding (P=0.001). Conclusions: There were significant differences in cognitive functions in patient with type2 diabetes, pre-diabetic patients and normal individuals. Thus monitoring neuropsychological status besides controlling levels of blood sugar in these patients is important."
24075821,No sex differences in neuropsychological performance in first episode psychosis patients,Rosa Ayesa-Arriola,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to verify whether male patients with psychosis have greater neurocognitive impairment than female patients at illness onset. Method: Participants with a first episode of psychosis (74 women/86 men) and healthy controls (62 women/97 men) were assessed with an extensive neuropsychological test battery. Results: Women in the clinical group were older at illness onset and had achieved higher formal education than men. This trend was the same for the control group. The patient group presented with lower premorbid IQ compared to healthy controls, and performed below for most neuropsychological tests. Women scored higher than men on a test of verbal memory, whereas men scored higher than women on a test of reaction time, visual memory, and a planning task. There were no group-by-sex interactions for any of the neuropsychological tests. Conclusion: The present study shows that at the onset of psychosis there are no differences between males and females in neuropsychological performance. The differential pattern of cognitive performance observed is similar to that in healthy males and females. Furthermore, females with a late onset of psychosis may represent a subgroup with specific visuospatial and problem solving impairments."
24075495,Effects on cognition of conventional and robotically assisted cardiac valve operation,Kathryn M Bruce,"Background: The effect of valve surgical procedures on cognition was investigated in patients undergoing conventional or robotically assisted techniques. The confounding factors of surgical procedure, mood state, preexisting cognitive impairment, and repeated experience with cognitive tests were controlled for. Methods: Patients undergoing conventional valve procedures (n = 15), robotically assisted valve procedures (n = 15), and thoracic surgical procedures (n = 15), along with a nonsurgical control group (n = 15) were tested preoperatively, 1 week after operation, and 8 weeks after operation by use of a battery of cognitive tests and a mood state assessment. Surgical group data were normalized against data from the nonsurgical control group before statistical analysis. Results: Patients undergoing conventional valve procedures performed worse than those undergoing robotically assisted valve procedures on every subtest before operation, and this disadvantage persisted after operation. Age and premorbid intelligence quotient were significantly associated with performance on several cognitive subtests. Anxiety, depression, and stress were not associated with impaired cognitive performance in the surgical groups after operation. A week after operation, patients undergoing conventional valve procedures performed worse on the cognitive tests that had a motor component, which may reflect discomfort caused by the sternotomy. Patients undergoing robotically assisted valve procedures were significantly less impaired on information processing tasks 1 week after operation when compared with those undergoing conventional valve procedures. The majority of patients who were impaired 1 week after operation recovered to preoperation levels within 8 weeks. Conclusions: The robotically assisted valve surgical procedure results in more rapid recovery of performance on cognitive tests. However, regardless of the type of surgical intervention, the prospect of a recovery of cognitive performance to preoperative levels is high."
24071647,Integrated all-optical logic discriminators based on plasmonic bandgap engineering,Cuicui Lu,"Optical computing uses photons as information carriers, opening up the possibility for ultrahigh-speed and ultrawide-band information processing. Integrated all-optical logic devices are indispensible core components of optical computing systems. However, up to now, little experimental progress has been made in nanoscale all-optical logic discriminators, which have the function of discriminating and encoding incident light signals according to wavelength. Here, we report a strategy to realize a nanoscale all-optical logic discriminator based on plasmonic bandgap engineering in a planar plasmonic microstructure. Light signals falling within different operating wavelength ranges are differentiated and endowed with different logic state encodings. Compared with values previously reported, the operating bandwidth is enlarged by one order of magnitude. Also the SPP light source is integrated with the logic device while retaining its ultracompact size. This opens up a way to construct on-chip all-optical information processors and artificial intelligence systems."
24071525,Cognitive ability changes and dynamics of cortical thickness development in healthy children and adolescents,Miguel Burgaleta,"Intelligence quotient (IQ) scores tend to remain stable across the lifespan. Nevertheless, in some healthy individuals, significant decreases or increases in IQ have been observed over time. It is unclear whether such changes reflect true functional change or merely measurement error. Here, we applied surface-based corticometry to investigate vertex-wise cortical surface area and thickness correlates of changes in Full Scale IQ (FSIQ), Performance IQ (PIQ) and Verbal IQ (VIQ) in a representative sample of children and adolescents (n=188, mean age=11.59years) assessed two years apart as part of the NIH Study of Normal Brain Development. No significant associations between changes in IQ measures and changes in cortical surface area were observed, whereas changes in FSIQ, PIQ, and VIQ were related to rates of cortical thinning, mainly in left frontal areas. Participants who showed reliable gains in FSIQ showed no significant changes in cortical thickness on average, whereas those who exhibited no significant FSIQ change showed moderate declines in cortical thickness. Importantly, individuals who showed large decreases in FSIQ displayed the steepest and most significant reductions in cortical thickness. Results support the view that there can be meaningful cognitive ability changes that impact IQ within relatively short developmental periods and show that such changes are associated with the dynamics of cortical thickness development."
24071437,Neurocognitive functioning in adults with phenylketonuria: results of a long term study,J Weglage,"Objectives: A controlled long-term study was performed to assess the neurological and neuropsychological performance in adult patients with early-treated phenylketonuria (PKU). Methods: We investigated 57 patients with early-treated classical PKU aged 19 to 41 years (mean age 31 years) and 46 matched healthy controls, matched for age and socioeconomic status. Patients and controls were assessed for their intelligence quotient (IQ), and attention and information-processing abilities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed in all patients. Neuropsychological assessments and MRI were repeated at a five-year-follow-up. Results: In the five-year interval IQ, information processing and attention of patients and controls remained constant. At both assessment times the IQ scores were significantly lower in patients compared to controls. Older adult patients (>32 years) showed poorer information processing and attention at both assessment times compared to young adult patients (<32 years) and controls. IQ, information processing and attention showed no correlation to imaging results but were significantly correlated to blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in patients' childhood and adolescence, and Phe levels had been higher in the adolescent years of older adult patients. Conclusions: Cognitive performance in adult patients with early-treated PKU does not seem to be subject to deterioration observable in a five-year interval. Neuropsychological assessment in adults with PKU revealed neurocognitive impairment particularly in older adult patients. This seems to refer to an early relaxation of diet that was recommended when the older patients were adolescents. Results indicate a benefit of dietary control during adolescence in PKU."
24069291,Environmental influences on mate preferences as assessed by a scenario manipulation experiment,Daniele Marzoli,"Many evolutionary psychology studies have addressed the topic of mate preferences, focusing particularly on gender and cultural differences. However, the extent to which situational and environmental variables might affect mate preferences has been comparatively neglected. We tested 288 participants in order to investigate the perceived relative importance of six traits of an ideal partner (wealth, dominance, intelligence, height, kindness, attractiveness) under four different hypothetical scenarios (status quo/nowadays, violence/post-nuclear, poverty/resource exhaustion, prosperity/global well-being). An equal number of participants (36 women, 36 men) was allotted to each scenario; each was asked to allocate 120 points across the six traits according to their perceived value. Overall, intelligence was the trait to which participants assigned most importance, followed by kindness and attractiveness, and then by wealth, dominance and height. Men appraised attractiveness as more valuable than women. Scenario strongly influenced the relative importance attributed to traits, the main finding being that wealth and dominance were more valued in the poverty and post-nuclear scenarios, respectively, compared to the other scenarios. Scenario manipulation generally had similar effects in both sexes, but women appeared particularly prone to trade off other traits for dominance in the violence scenario, and men particularly prone to trade off other traits for wealth in the poverty scenario. Our results are in line with other correlational studies of situational variables and mate preferences, and represent strong evidence of a causal relationship of environmental factors on specific mate preferences, corroborating the notion of an evolved plasticity to current ecological conditions. A control experiment seems to suggest that our scenarios can be considered as realistic descriptions of the intended ecological conditions."
24067669,"Maternal fatty acids in pregnancy, FADS polymorphisms, and child intelligence quotient at 8 y of age",Colin D Steer,"Background: Brain tissue is selectively enriched with highly unsaturated fatty acids (FAs). Altering the maternal FA status in pregnancy may improve fetal neural development with lasting consequences for child development. Objective: We explored whether maternal FAs in erythrocytes, either measured directly or indirectly by maternal FADS genetic variants, are associated with child intelligence quotient (IQ). Design: Linear regression analyses, adjusted for 18 confounders, were used to investigate the associations in 2839 mother-child pairs from the population-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort. Results: Low levels of arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) were associated with lower performance IQ (-2.0 points; 95% CI: -3.5, -0.6 points; P = 0.007, increased R² = 0.27%), high levels of osbond acid (22:5n-6) were associated with verbal IQ (-1.8 points; 95% CI: -3.2, -0.4 points; P = 0.014, R² = 0.20%), and high levels of adrenic acid (22:4n-6) were associated with verbal IQ (-1.7 points; 95% CI:-3.1, -0.3 points; P = 0.016, R² = 0.19%). There was some evidence to support a negative association of low docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) with full-scale IQ (R² = 0.15%). Novel weak associations were also observed for low levels of osbond acid (R² ≤ 0.29%) and FADS variants with opposite effects for intron variants and variants in the promoter region such as rs3834458 (R² ≤ 0.38%). Conclusions: These results support the positive role of maternal arachidonic acid and DHA on fetal neural development, although the effects on child IQ by 8 y of age were small (0.1 SD), with other factors contributing more substantially. The endogenous synthesis of these FAs by FADS genes, especially FADS2, may also be important. The replication of these results is recommended."
24065936,Ode to positive constructive daydreaming,Rebecca L McMillan,"Nearly 60 years ago, Jerome L. Singer launched a groundbreaking research program into daydreaming (Singer, 1955, 1975, 2009) that presaged and laid the foundation for virtually every major strand of mind wandering research active today (Antrobus, 1999; Klinger, 1999, 2009). Here we review Singer's enormous contribution to the field, which includes insights, methodologies, and tools still in use today, and trace his enduring legacy as revealed in the recent proliferation of mind wandering studies. We then turn to the central theme in Singer's work, the adaptive nature of positive constructive daydreaming, which was a revolutionary idea when Singer began his work in the 1950s and remains underreported today. Last, we propose a new approach to answering the enduring question: Why does mind wandering persist and occupy so much of our time, as much as 50% of our waking time according to some estimates, if it is as costly as most studies suggest?"
24065154,"Maternal diabetes in pregnancy and offspring cognitive ability: sibling study with 723,775 men from 579,857 families",Abigail Fraser,"Aims/hypothesis: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between maternal diabetes in pregnancy and offspring cognitive ability and also to assess whether the association was due to intrauterine mechanisms or shared familial characteristics. Methods: We linked national registers and conducted a prospective cohort study of singleton Swedish-born men to explore associations between maternal pregnancy diabetes and educational achievement at age 16 years, the age of completing compulsory education in Sweden (n = 391,545 men from 337,174 families, graduating in 1988-1997 and n = 326,033 men from 282,079 families, graduating in 1998-2009), and intelligence quotient (IQ) at the mandatory conscription examination at 18 years of age (n = 664,871 from 543,203 families). Results: Among non-siblings, maternal diabetes in pregnancy was associated with lower offspring cognitive ability even after adjustment for maternal age at birth, parity, education, early-pregnancy BMI, offspring birth year, gestational age and birthweight. For example, in non-siblings, the IQ of men whose mothers had diabetes in their pregnancy was on average 1.36 points lower (95% CI -2.12, -0.60) than men whose mothers did not have diabetes. In comparison, we found no such association within sibships (mean difference 1.70; 95% CI -1.80, 5.21). Conclusions/interpretation: The association between maternal diabetes in pregnancy and offspring cognitive outcomes is likely explained by shared familial characteristics and not by an intrauterine mechanism."
24064575,Application of the Rasch model to measuring the performance of cognitive radios,Edward W Wolfe,"Cognitive radios (CRs) are recent technological developments that rely on artificial intelligence to adapt a radio's performance to suit environmental demands, such as sharing radio frequencies with other radios. Measuring the performance of the cognitive engines (CEs) that underlie a CR's performance is a challenge for those developing CR technology. This simulation study illustrates how the Rasch model can be applied to the evaluation of CRs. We simulated the responses of 50 CEs to 35 performance tasks and applied the Random Coefficients Multidimensional Multinomial Logit Model (MRCMLM) to those data. Our results indicate that CEs based on different algorithms may exhibit differential performance across manipulated performance task parameters. We found that a multidimensional mixture model may provide the best fit to the simulated data and that the two algorithms simulated may respond to tasks that emphasize achieving high levels of data throughput coupled with lower emphasis on power conservation differently than they do to other combinations of performance task characteristics."
24064408,Visual search and attention in five-year-old very preterm/very low birth weight children,Christiaan J A Geldof,"Introduction: This study aimed to establish visual search performance and attention functioning in very preterm/very low birth weight (VP/VLBW) children using novel and well established measures, and to study their contribution to intellectual functioning. Methods: Visual search and attention network efficiency were assessed in 108 VP/VLBW children and 72 age matched term controls at 5.5 years corrected age. Visual search performance was investigated with a newly developed paradigm manipulating stimulus density and stimulus organization. Attention functioning was studied using the Attention Network Test (ANT). Intellectual functioning was measured by a short form of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. Data were analyzed using ANOVAs and multiple regression analyses. Results: Visual search was less efficient in VP/VLBW children as compared to term controls, as indicated by increased search time (0.31 SD, p = .04) and increased error rate (0.36 SD, p = .02). In addition, VP/VLBW children demonstrated poorer executive attention as indicated by lower accuracy for the executive attention measure of the ANT (0.61 SD, p < .001). No differences were found for the alerting (0.06 SD, p = .68) and orienting attention measures (0.13 SD, p = .42). Visual search time and error rate, and executive attention, collectively, accounted for 14% explained variance in full scale IQ (R(2) = .14, p < .001). Discussion: VP/VLBW children were characterized by less efficient visual search ability and reduced executive attention. Visual attention dysfunctions contributed to intelligence, suggesting the opportunity to improve intellectual functioning by using interventions programs that may enhance attention capacities."
24063149,Development of the Japanese version of the Emotion Awareness Questionnaire for junior high school students],Kenichiro Ishizu,"This study reports about the development of the Japanese version of the Emotion Awareness Questionnaire for junior high school students. Emotion Awareness Questionnaire (EAQ; Rieffe, Oosterveld, Miers, Meerum Terwogt, & Ly, 2008) for children and adolescents aims not only to monitor and differentiate emotions but also to measure attitudes about emotions. It consists of six factors: differentiating emotions, verbal sharing of emotions, not hiding emotion, bodily awareness, attending to others' emotion, analyses of emotions. To examine the reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the EAQ, junior high school students (7th to 9th grades) were requested to complete the questionnaires (n = 535 in time 1, n = 537 in time 2, n = 330 in time 3). The results showed that the Japanese version of the EAQ had almost the same six-factor structure as the original one. It also had moderate internal consistency and test-retest reliability (three weeks). The validity of the scale was examined in relation to emotional intelligence, social anxiety, depression, psychological stress responses, evaluation of emotions, self esteem and sense of authenticity. The results confirmed that the Japanese version of the EAQ had good validity."
24062592,The social defeat hypothesis of schizophrenia: an update,Jean-Paul Selten,"According to the social defeat (SD) hypothesis, published in 2005, long-term exposure to the experience of SD may lead to sensitization of the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system and thereby increase the risk for schizophrenia. The hypothesis posits that SD (ie, the negative experience of being excluded from the majority group) is the common denominator of 5 major schizophrenia risk factors: urban upbringing, migration, childhood trauma, low intelligence, and drug abuse. The purpose of this update of the literature since 2005 is to answer 2 questions: (1) What is the evidence that SD explains the association between schizophrenia and these risk factors? (2) What is the evidence that SD leads to sensitization of the mesolimbic DA system? The evidence for SD as the mechanism underlying the increased risk was found to be strongest for migration and childhood trauma, while the evidence for urban upbringing, low intelligence, and drug abuse is suggestive, but insufficient. Some other findings that may support the hypothesis are the association between risk for schizophrenia and African American ethnicity, unemployment, single status, hearing impairment, autism, illiteracy, short stature, Klinefelter syndrome, and, possibly, sexual minority status. While the evidence that SD in humans leads to sensitization of the mesolimbic DA system is not sufficient, due to lack of studies, the evidence for this in animals is strong. The authors argue that the SD hypothesis provides a parsimonious and plausible explanation for a number of epidemiological findings that cannot be explained solely by genetic confounding."
24062441,Basal variability in CREB phosphorylation predicts trait-like differences in amygdala-dependent memory,Kiriana K Cowansage,"Much of what is known about the neurobiology of learning and memory comes from studies of the average behavior. In contrast, intersubject differences that emerge within groups are difficult to study systematically and are often excluded from scientific discussion. Nevertheless, population-wide variability is a virtually universal feature of both complex traits, such as intelligence, and hardwired responses, such as defensive behaviors. Here, we use outbred rats to investigate if cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a transcription factor that has long been known in experimental settings to be crucial for associative plasticity, participates in natural memory phenotypes. Using a combination of behavioral, biochemical, and viral techniques, we show that a subset of rats with trait-like deficits in aversive memory have basally reduced CREB activity in the lateral amygdala but can be induced to perform at average levels by directly or indirectly enhancing pretraining CREB phosphorylation. These data suggest that endogenous CREB activity in the amygdala may set a critical threshold for plasticity during memory formation."
24062410,Intelligence in early adulthood and mortality from natural and unnatural causes in middle-aged Danish men,Rikke Hodal Meincke,"Background: High intelligence early in life has consistently been associated with decreased mortality, but the mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this cohort study, we examined the association between intelligence in early adulthood and later mortality from natural and unnatural causes taking birth weight, parental socioeconomic position, participants' own education and body mass index into account. Methods: 13 536 Danish men born in 1953 and 1959-1961 with data from birth certificates and intelligence test scores from conscription were followed until 2009. Information on vital status was obtained from the Civil Registration System. Mortality risks were analysed by the multiple Cox proportional hazards model. Results: The risk of mortality from natural as well as unnatural causes was more than twice as high among men in the lowest scoring intelligence tertile (HRnatural deaths=2.24; 1.90-2.65 and HRunnatural deaths=2.67; 2.03-3.53). Adjusting for all covariates attenuated the estimates, but the association remained (HRnatural deaths=1.82; 1.48-2.25 and HRunnatural deaths=2.30; 1.63-3.25). Conclusions: In men, intelligence in early adulthood was inversely associated with midlife mortality from natural and unnatural causes. The associations remained after adjustments for a range of covariates."
24060844,"Humor processing in children: influence of temperament, age and IQ",Pascal Vrticka,"Emerging evidence from fMRI studies suggests that humor processing is a specific social cognitive-affective human function that comprises two stages. The first stage (cognitive humor component) involves the detection and resolution of incongruity, and is associated with activity in temporo-occipito-parietal brain areas. The second stage (emotional humor component) comprises positive feelings related to mirth/reward, and is linked with reward-related activity in mesocorticolimbic circuits. In healthy adults, humor processing was shown to be moderated by temperament traits like intro-/extraversion, neuroticism, or social anxiety, representing risk factors for psychopathology. However, comparable data from early developmental stages is crucially lacking. Here, we report for the first time data from 22 children (ages 6 to 13) revealing an influence of temperament on humor processing. Specifically, we assessed the effects of Emotionality, Shyness, and Sociability, which are analogous to neuroticism, behavioral inhibition/fear and extraversion in adults. We found Emotionality to be positively, but Shyness negatively associated with brain activity linked with both cognitive and emotional humor components. In addition, Shyness and Sociability were positively related to activity in the periaqueductal gray region during humor processing. These findings are of potential clinical relevance regarding the early detection of childhood psychopathology. Previous data on humor processing in both adults and children furthermore suggest that intelligence (IQ) supports incongruity detection and resolution, whereas mirth and associated brain activity diminishes with increasing age. Here, we found that increasing age and IQ were linked with stronger activity to humor in brain areas implicated in the cognitive component of humor. Such data suggest that humor processing undergoes developmental changes and is moderated by higher IQ scores, both factors likely improving incongruity detection and resolution."
24059443,Effects of interactive metronome therapy on cognitive functioning after blast-related brain injury: a randomized controlled pilot trial,Lonnie A Nelson,"Objective: We report preliminary findings on the efficacy of interactive metronome (IM) therapy for the remediation of cognitive difficulties in soldiers with persisting cognitive complaints following blast-related mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method: Forty-six of a planned sample of 50 active duty soldiers with persistent cognitive complaints following a documented history of blast-related TBI of mild-to-moderate severity were randomly assigned to receive either standard rehabilitation care (SRC) or SRC plus a 15-session standardized course of IM therapy. Primary outcome measures were Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Index Scores. Secondary outcome measures included selected subtests from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functioning System (Trail Making Test and Color-Word Interference) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (Symbol Search, Digit-Symbol Coding, Digit Span, and Letter-Number Sequencing) as well as the Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test. Results: Significant group differences (SRC vs. IM) were observed for RBANS Attention (p = .044), Immediate Memory (p = .019), and Delayed Memory (p = .031) indices in unadjusted analyses, with the IM group showing significantly greater improvement at Time 2 than the SRC group, with effect sizes in the medium-to-large range in the adjusted analyses for each outcome (Cohen's d = 0.511, 0.768, and 0.527, respectively). Though not all were statistically significant, effects in 21 of 26 cognitive outcome measures were consistently in favor of the IM treatment group (binomial probability = .00098). Conclusion: The addition of IM therapy to SRC appears to have a positive effect on neuropsychological outcomes for soldiers who have sustained mild-to-moderate TBI and have persistent cognitive complaints after the period for expected recovery has passed."
24058643,Modeling individual subtests of the WAIS IV with multiple latent factors,Dennis J McFarland,"Performance on a cognitive test can be viewed either as measuring a unitary function or as reflecting the operation of multiple factors. Individual subtests in batteries designed to measure human abilities are commonly modeled as a single latent factor. Several latent factors are then used to model groups of subtests. However these latent factors are not independent as they are related through hierarchical or oblique structures. As a result, the simple structure of subtest performance results in complex latent factors. The present study used structural equation modeling to evaluate several multidimensional models of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales-fourth edition (WAIS-IV) subtests. Multidimensional models of subtest performance provided better model fit as compared to several previously proposed one dimensional models. These multidimensional models also generalized well to new samples of populations differing in age from that used to estimate the model parameters. Overall these results show that models that describe subtests as multidimensional functions of uncorrelated factors provided a better fit to the WAIS-IV correlations than models that describe subtests as one dimensional functions of correlated factors. There appears to be a trade-off in modeling subtests as one dimensional and modeling with homogeneous latent traits. More consideration should be given to models that include multiple uncorrelated latent factors as determinants of the performance on a given subtest. These results support the view that performance on any given cognitive test is potentially the result of multiple factors. Simple structure may be too simple."
24056561,"Prevalence of specific developmental disorder of scholastic skill in school students in Chandigarh, India",Priti Arun,"Background & objectives: Several studies have been conducted in India to determine the prevalence of learning disabilities in school children which has been reported to be 3-10 per cent among students population. The present study was conducted to find out prevalence of specific developmental disorder of scholastic skills in students of classes VII to XII and to find out feasibility of screening tool in Chandigarh, India. Methods: A cross-sectional study on school students was carried out in two phases. The students were drawn from classes VII to XII from 10 schools of Chandigarh, India. Details of academic performance of all the students was taken, subjectively from class teachers and objectively from the marks obtained in the last academic session. In phase I, 2402 students were assessed. In phase II, 108 students were randomly selected for evaluation for assessing sensitivity and specificity of screening proforma for teachers. A total of 124 students from phase I and all students in phase II were assessed in detail. Tests of intelligence (Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian Children and Standard Progressive Matrices), and NIMHANS Index for specific learning disability (SLD) battery were administered. Results: A total of 38 students were found to be having specific developmental disorder of scholastic skills in phase I, that gave a prevalence of 1.58 per cent. Majority had mixed type of errors on SLD battery. There were more boys diagnosed with specific learning disability. Teacher's screening instrument had high sensitivity (90.385) and specificity (94.68). Interpretation & conclusions: The findings of our study conducted in community, showed that specific learning disability was not identified even till later age. The screening instrument thus could be used by teachers to suspect students with specific learning disability."
24055883,Cultural differences in neuropsychological abilities required to perform intelligence tasks,Ahmed F Fasfous,"Different studies have demonstrated that culture has a basic role in intelligence tests performance. Nevertheless, the specific neuropsychological abilities used by different cultures to perform an intelligence test have never been explored. In this study, we examine the differences between Spaniards and Moroccans in the neuropsychological abilities utilized to perform the Beta III as a non-verbal intelligence test. The results showed that the Spaniard group obtained a higher IQ than the Moroccan group in the Beta III. Moreover, the neuropsychological abilities that predicted scores for the Beta III were dependent on the country of origin and were different for each subtest. Besides showing the cultural effect on non-verbal intelligence test performance, our results suggest that a single test may measure different functions, depending on the subject's cultural background."
24054061,Development of brief versions of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for schizophrenia: considerations of the structure and predictability of intelligence,Chika Sumiyoshi,"Short forms (SF) of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale have been developed to enhance its practicality. However, only a few studies have addressed the Wechsler Intelligence Scale Revised (WAIS-R) SFs based on data from patients with schizophrenia. The current study was conducted to develop the WAIS-R SFs for these patients based on the intelligence structure and predictability of the Full IQ (FIQ). Relations to demographic and clinical variables were also examined on selecting plausible subtests. The WAIS-R was administered to 90 Japanese patients with schizophrenia. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and multiple regression analysis were conducted to find potential subtests. EFA extracted two dominant factors corresponding to Verbal IQ and Performance IQ measures. Subtests with higher factor loadings on those factors were initially nominated. Regression analysis was carried out to reach the model containing all the nominated subtests. The optimality of the potential subtests included in that model was evaluated from the perspectives of the representativeness of intelligence structure, FIQ predictability, and the relation with demographic and clinical variables. Taken together, the dyad of Vocabulary and Block Design was considered to be the most optimal WAIS-R SF for patients with schizophrenia, reflecting both intelligence structure and FIQ predictability."
24053879,The systematic profiling of false identity documents: method validation and performance evaluation using seizures known to originate from common and different sources,Simon Baechler,"False identity documents constitute a potential powerful source of forensic intelligence because they are essential elements of transnational crime and provide cover for organized crime. In previous work, a systematic profiling method using false documents' visual features has been built within a forensic intelligence model. In the current study, the comparison process and metrics lying at the heart of this profiling method are described and evaluated. This evaluation takes advantage of 347 false identity documents of four different types seized in two countries whose sources were known to be common or different (following police investigations and dismantling of counterfeit factories). Intra-source and inter-sources variations were evaluated through the computation of more than 7500 similarity scores. The profiling method could thus be validated and its performance assessed using two complementary approaches to measuring type I and type II error rates: a binary classification and the computation of likelihood ratios. Very low error rates were measured across the four document types, demonstrating the validity and robustness of the method to link documents to a common source or to differentiate them. These results pave the way for an operational implementation of a systematic profiling process integrated in a developed forensic intelligence model."
24053872,Towards the integration of matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry imaging into the current fingermark examination workflow,Robert Bradshaw,"A wide range of fingermark enhancement techniques (FET) is currently employed to visualise latent fingermarks at crime scenes. However, if smudged, partial, distorted or absent in the National Fingerprint Database, crime scene marks may be not useful for identification purposes. In these circumstances, a technology enabling chemical imaging of both endogenous and exogenous species contained within the fingermark could provide additional and associative investigative information, to profile the suspect's activities prior to the crime. Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI MSI) has proven to be such a technique, enabling investigative information to be gathered, for example, on what substances the donor has come in contact with and what they have ingested. Nonetheless, to be employed, MALDI MSI has to be validated and its compatibility with FET tested for integration into the standard fingermark examination workflow. For the first time, a direct comparison has been made between the efficiency of a range of FET and MALDI MSI under different conditions. This information will build towards validation of the technology. Also, for the first time, MALDI MSI has been successfully employed as a sequential step following fingermark enhancement using many of the currently employed FET. Additionally, known enhancers have been ""re-visited"" by combining them with a MALDI matrix, providing both improved fingermark development and chemical species detection via MALDI MSI. The result reported here are good indication in favour of the integration of MALDI MSI into the current fingermark examination workflow for gathering additional investigative information."
24053689,An evaluation of the global network of field epidemiology and laboratory training programmes: a resource for improving public health capacity and increasing the number of public health professionals worldwide,Renee E Subramanian,"Background: Given that many infectious diseases spread rapidly, across borders and species, there is a growing worldwide need to increase the number of public health professionals skilled in controlling infectious epidemics. Needed also are more public health professionals skilled in non-communicable disease surveillance and interventions. As a result, we surveyed all 57 field epidemiology training programmes (FETPs) that are members of the Training Program in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network (TEPHINET), to evaluate the progress of the FETPs, the only global applied epidemiology network, toward increasing public health capacity globally. Methods: Data on the FETP programmes and the training they provide were abstracted from TEPHINET membership surveys and verified with FETP directors for all FETPs that were members of TEPHINET in 2012. Data on abstracts submitted to the recent TEPHINET Global Scientific Conference, on recent accomplishments by each FETP, and on quality improvement were also compiled to provide a worldwide view of the public health human resource capacity produced by these programmes. Results: A total of 6980 public health professionals worldwide have graduated from an FETP or from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Epidemiology Intelligence Service (EIS). FETP residents and graduates participate in key public health prevention, control, and response activities. Each FETP has adapted its curriculum and objectives over time to align with its country's public health priorities. FETPs are well integrated into their national public health infrastructures, and they have many partners at the national, regional and global levels. Conclusion: FETPs are a competent and diverse source of highly skilled public health professionals who contribute significantly to public health's global human resource needs. This finding is evidenced by 1) the training curricula that were adapted over time to meet public health's human resource needs, 2) the FETPs' continued support from internal and external partners, 3) the increasing number of FETP residents and graduates and their increasing contribution to effective public health work, and 4) the increased quality improvement initiatives facilitated through the FETPs membership in one global network, TEPHINET."
24051780,An extensible framework for provenance in human terrain visual analytics,Rick Walker,"We describe and demonstrate an extensible framework that supports data exploration and provenance in the context of Human Terrain Analysis (HTA). Working closely with defence analysts we extract requirements and a list of features that characterise data analysed at the end of the HTA chain. From these, we select an appropriate non-classified data source with analogous features, and model it as a set of facets. We develop ProveML, an XML-based extension of the Open Provenance Model, using these facets and augment it with the structures necessary to record the provenance of data, analytical process and interpretations. Through an iterative process, we develop and refine a prototype system for Human Terrain Visual Analytics (HTVA), and demonstrate means of storing, browsing and recalling analytical provenance and process through analytic bookmarks in ProveML. We show how these bookmarks can be combined to form narratives that link back to the live data. Throughout the process, we demonstrate that through structured workshops, rapid prototyping and structured communication with intelligence analysts we are able to establish requirements, and design schema, techniques and tools that meet the requirements of the intelligence community. We use the needs and reactions of defence analysts in defining and steering the methods to validate the framework."
24051763,Decision exploration lab: a visual analytics solution for decision management,Bertjan Broeksema,"We present a visual analytics solution designed to address prevalent issues in the area of Operational Decision Management (ODM). In ODM, which has its roots in Artificial Intelligence (Expert Systems) and Management Science, it is increasingly important to align business decisions with business goals. In our work, we consider decision models (executable models of the business domain) as ontologies that describe the business domain, and production rules that describe the business logic of decisions to be made over this ontology. Executing a decision model produces an accumulation of decisions made over time for individual cases. We are interested, first, to get insight in the decision logic and the accumulated facts by themselves. Secondly and more importantly, we want to see how the accumulated facts reveal potential divergences between the reality as captured by the decision model, and the reality as captured by the executed decisions. We illustrate the motivation, added value for visual analytics, and our proposed solution and tooling through a business case from the car insurance industry."
24051542,Facial affect recognition performance and event-related potentials in violent and non-violent schizophrenia patients,Nicole Frommann,"We investigated whether male inpatients with schizophrenia and a history of hands-on violent offences (forensic schizophrenic, FOS) are more impaired in emotion recognition than matched schizophrenia patients without any history of violence (general psychiatric schizophrenic, GPS). This should become apparent in performance in psychometry and in scalp event-related brain potentials (ERPs) evoked by pictures of facial affect. FOS and GPS (each n = 19) were matched concerning age, intelligence, comorbid addiction, medication and illness duration. FOS revealed significantly poorer affect recognition (AR) performance, especially of neutral and fear stimuli. Analysis of ERPs revealed a significant interaction of hemisphere, electrode position and group of the N250 component. Post hoc analysis of group effect showed significantly larger amplitudes in FOS at FC3. These results support the hypothesis that in FOS emotional faces are more salient and evoke higher arousal. Larger impairment in AR performance combined with higher salience and arousal may contribute to the occurrence of violent acts in schizophrenia patients."
24050681,Active cognitive reserve influences the regional atrophy to cognition link in multiple sclerosis,Adam J Booth,"Recent research indicates that cognitive reserve mitigates the clinical expression of neuropsychological impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS). This literature primarily uses premorbid intelligence and lifetime experiences as indicators. However, changes in current recreational activities may also contribute to the maintenance of neural function despite brain atrophy. We examined the moderation effects of current changes in recreational activity on the relationship between brain atrophy and information processing speed in 57 relapsing-remitting MS patients. Current enrichment was assessed using the Recreation and Pastimes subscale from the Sickness Impact Profile. In patients reporting current declines in recreational activities, brain atrophy was negatively associated with cognition, but there was no such association in participants reporting stable participation. The MRI metric-by-recreational activity interaction was significant in separate hierarchical regression analyses conducted using third ventricle width, neocortical volume, T2 lesion volume, and thalamic volume as brain measures. Results suggest that recreational activities protect against brain atrophy's detrimental influence on cognition."
24049557,Positive Affect Enhances the Association of Hypomanic Personality and Cognitive Flexibility,Daniel Fulford,"Several lines of research have suggested a link between mania and creativity, The goal of the present study was to test whether positive affect moderated the relationship between risk for mania (assessed with the Hypomanic Personality Scale [HPS]) and a variable postulated to be a cognitive component of creativity: cognitive flexibility. Fifty-three undergraduate students were randomly assigned to either a neutral or positive mood induction condition. They then completed the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Sorting Test as a measure of cognitive flexibility. Consistent with our hypothesis, higher HPS scores were associated with greater cognitive flexibility among participants in the positive mood induction condition. Covariate analyses revealed that results were not confounded by verbal intelligence or the presence of current depression symptoms. Our findings suggest a mood-dependent link between hypomanic personality and one potential component of creative cognition."
24049133,Duplications of 17q12 can cause familial fever-related epilepsy syndromes,Katia Hardies,"Objectives: After we identified a 17q12 duplication cosegregating in a 4-generation family with genetic or generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), we aimed to determine the frequency of 17q12 genomic rearrangements in GEFS+ and a wide spectrum of other epilepsy phenotypes. We furthermore describe seizure prevalence in previously reported patients with a 17q12 duplication or deletion. Methods: We analyzed 433 patients with a broad range of epilepsy phenotypes. The 180k Cytosure ISCA v2 array was used for copy number variation screening in the index patient. Segregation analysis and follow-up studies were performed with the multiplex amplicon quantification technique. Results: We identified 2 families in which a 17q12 duplication segregated with febrile-sensitive epilepsy. In the follow-up study, the mutation rate in familial febrile seizures (FS) and GEFS+ phenotypes was 1/222. No 17q12 deletions were detected. Two of the 6 mutation carriers in the initial GEFS+ family had mild intellectual disability, whereas all family members of the second family were of normal intelligence. In the literature, 4 of 43 individuals with a 17q12 duplication and 4 of 55 with the reciprocal deletion were described to have had seizures. Conclusions: Our study shows that 17q12 duplications are a rare cause of familial FS and GEFS+. Although some family members might have intellectual disability, seizures can be the sole clinical symptom. This is the first report on an inherited copy number variation in these self-limiting fever-sensitive epilepsy syndromes, potentially revealing a novel pathomechanism involved in familial FS and GEFS+."
24047949,Some factors underlying individual differences in speech recognition on PRESTO: a first report,Terrin N Tamati,"Background: Previous studies investigating speech recognition in adverse listening conditions have found extensive variability among individual listeners. However, little is currently known about the core underlying factors that influence speech recognition abilities. Purpose: To investigate sensory, perceptual, and neurocognitive differences between good and poor listeners on the Perceptually Robust English Sentence Test Open-set (PRESTO), a new high-variability sentence recognition test under adverse listening conditions. Research design: Participants who fell in the upper quartile (HiPRESTO listeners) or lower quartile (LoPRESTO listeners) on key word recognition on sentences from PRESTO in multitalker babble completed a battery of behavioral tasks and self-report questionnaires designed to investigate real-world hearing difficulties, indexical processing skills, and neurocognitive abilities. Study sample: Young, normal-hearing adults (N = 40) from the Indiana University community participated in the current study. Data collection and analysis: Participants' assessment of their own real-world hearing difficulties was measured with a self-report questionnaire on situational hearing and hearing health history. Indexical processing skills were assessed using a talker discrimination task, a gender discrimination task, and a forced-choice regional dialect categorization task. Neurocognitive abilities were measured with the Auditory Digit Span Forward (verbal short-term memory) and Digit Span Backward (verbal working memory) tests, the Stroop Color and Word Test (attention/inhibition), the WordFam word familiarity test (vocabulary size), the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) self-report questionnaire on executive function, and two performance subtests of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) Performance Intelligence Quotient (IQ; nonverbal intelligence). Scores on self-report questionnaires and behavioral tasks were tallied and analyzed by listener group (HiPRESTO and LoPRESTO). Results: The extreme groups did not differ overall on self-reported hearing difficulties in real-world listening environments. However, an item-by-item analysis of questions revealed that LoPRESTO listeners reported significantly greater difficulty understanding speakers in a public place. HiPRESTO listeners were significantly more accurate than LoPRESTO listeners at gender discrimination and regional dialect categorization, but they did not differ on talker discrimination accuracy or response time, or gender discrimination response time. HiPRESTO listeners also had longer forward and backward digit spans, higher word familiarity ratings on the WordFam test, and lower (better) scores for three individual items on the BRIEF-A questionnaire related to cognitive load. The two groups did not differ on the Stroop Color and Word Test or either of the WASI performance IQ subtests. Conclusions: HiPRESTO listeners and LoPRESTO listeners differed in indexical processing abilities, short-term and working memory capacity, vocabulary size, and some domains of executive functioning. These findings suggest that individual differences in the ability to encode and maintain highly detailed episodic information in speech may underlie the variability observed in speech recognition performance in adverse listening conditions using high-variability PRESTO sentences in multitalker babble."
24046750,Cocaine users manifest impaired prosodic and cross-modal emotion processing,Lea M Hulka,"Background: A small number of previous studies have provided evidence that cocaine users (CU) exhibit impairments in complex social cognition tasks, while the more basic facial emotion recognition is widely unaffected. However, prosody and cross-modal emotion processing has not been systematically investigated in CU so far. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess complex multisensory emotion processing in CU in comparison to controls and to examine a potential association with drug use patterns. Method: The abbreviated version of the comprehensive affect testing system (CATS-A) was used to measure emotion perception across the three channels of facial affect, prosody, and semantic content in 58 CU and 48 healthy control (HC) subjects who were matched for age, sex, verbal intelligence, and years of education. Results: CU had significantly lower scores than controls in the quotient scales of ""emotion recognition"" and ""prosody recognition"" and the subtests ""conflicting prosody/meaning - attend to prosody"" and ""match emotional prosody to emotional face"" either requiring to attend to prosody or to integrate cross-modal information. In contrast, no group difference emerged for the ""affect recognition quotient."" Cumulative cocaine doses and duration of cocaine use correlated negatively with emotion processing. Conclusion: CU show impaired cross-modal integration of different emotion processing channels particularly with regard to prosody, whereas more basic aspects of emotion processing such as facial affect perception are comparable to the performance of HC."
24044983,"Coevolution of intelligence, behavioral repertoire, and lifespan",Stefano Ghirlanda,"Across many taxa, intriguing positive correlations exist between intelligence (measured by proxy as encephalization), behavioral repertoire size, and lifespan. Here we argue, through a simple theoretical model, that such correlations arise from selection pressures for efficient learning of behavior sequences. We define intelligence operationally as the ability to disregard unrewarding behavior sequences, without trying them out, in the search for rewarding sequences. We show that increasing a species' behavioral repertoire increases the number of rewarding behavior sequences that can be performed, but also the time required to learn such sequences. This trade-off results in an optimal repertoire size that decreases rapidly with increasing sequence length. Behavioral repertoire size can be increased by increasing intelligence or lengthening the lifespan, giving rise to the observed correlations between these traits."
24044669,Application of pattern recognition tools for classifying acute coronary syndrome: an integrated medical modeling,Nader Salari,"Objective: The classification of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), using artificial intelligence (AI), has recently drawn the attention of the medical researchers. Using this approach, patients with myocardial infarction can be differentiated from those with unstable angina. The present study aims to develop an integrated model, based on the feature selection and classification, for the automatic classification of ACS. Methods: A dataset containing medical records of 809 patients suspected to suffer from ACS was used. For each subject, 266 clinical factors were collected. At first, a feature selection was performed based on interviews with 20 cardiologists; thereby 40 seminal features for classifying ACS were selected. Next, a feature selection algorithm was also applied to detect a subset of the features with the best classification accuracy. As a result, the feature numbers considerably reduced to only seven. Lastly, based on the seven selected features, eight various common pattern recognition tools for classification of ACS were used. Results: The performance of the aforementioned classifiers was compared based on their accuracy computed from their confusion matrices. Among these methods, the multi-layer perceptron showed the best performance with the 83.2% accuracy. Conclusion: The results reveal that an integrated AI-based feature selection and classification approach is an effective method for the early and accurate classification of ACS and ultimately a timely diagnosis and treatment of this disease."
24041490,Frontal cortical thinning and subcortical volume reductions in early adulthood obesity,Idoia Marqués-Iturria,"Obesity depends on homeostatic and hedonic food intake behavior, mediated by brain plasticity changes in cortical and subcortical structures. The aim of this study was to investigate cortical thickness and subcortical volumes of regions related to food intake behavior in a healthy young adult sample with obesity. Thirty-seven volunteers, 19 with obesity (age=33.7±5.7 (20-39) years body-mass index (BMI)=36.08±5.92 (30.10-49.69)kg/m(2)) and 18 controls (age=32.3±5.9 (21-40) years; BMI=22.54±1.94 (19.53-24.97)kg/m(2)) participated in the study. Patients with neuropsychiatric or biomedical disorders were excluded. We used FreeSurfer software to analyze structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) and obtain global brain measures, cortical thickness and subcortical volume estimations. Finally, correlation analyses were performed for brain structure data and obesity measures. There were no between-group differences in age, gender, intelligence or education. Results showed cortical thickness reductions in obesity in the left superior frontal and right medial orbitofrontal cortex. In addition, the obesity group had lower ventral diencephalon and brainstem volumes than controls, while there were no differences in any other subcortical structure. There were no statistically significant correlations between brain structure and obesity measures. Overall, our work provides evidence of the structural brain characteristics associated with metabolically normal obesity. We found reductions in cortical thickness, ventral diencephalon and brainstem volumes in areas that have been implicated in food intake behavior."
24041301,Intelligence as it relates to conscious and unconscious memory influences,Steve Joordens,"We examine the relationship between a measure of intelligence and estimates of conscious and unconscious memory influences derived using Jacoby's (Jacoby, L. L. [1991]. A process dissociation framework: Separating automatic from intentional uses of memory. Journal of Memory and Language, 30, 513-541.) process-dissociation procedure. We find a positive relationship between intelligence and conscious memory, and no relationship between intelligence and unconscious influences once the impact of conscious influences are removed (Experiment 1). We also find that when participants cannot engage in conscious strategies, such as when there is insufficient time for learning, the relationships observed in Experiment 1 are eliminated (Experiments 2A and 2B). Our results support the notion that individual differences in intelligence reflect differences in conscious strategic processes (Karis, D., Fabiani, M., & Donchin, E. [1984]. ""P300"" and memory: Individual differences in the von Restorff effect. Cognitive Psychology, 16, 177-216.) and not differences in mental speed (Eysenck, H. J. (1984). Intelligence versus behavior. The Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 7, 290-291; Jensen, A. R. [1982]. Bias in mental testing. New York, NY: Free Press)."
24041000,Intellect and cognitive performance in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936,Sophie von Stumm,"Investment personality traits are thought to positively affect cognitive performance in old age, even after controlling for prior cognitive ability. In the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (N = 1,091), a cross-lagged model tested for reciprocal effects of the investment trait Intellect on verbal fluency, an indicator of crystallized intelligence, at age 70 and 73 years, while adjusting for general IQ at age 11 and 70 years. Intellect at age 70 was weakly associated with contemporaneous verbal fluency but had no significant effects on fluency at age 73. Conversely, verbal fluency at age 70 was significantly, positively related to Intellect at age 73. The results suggest that better verbal fluency precedes intellectual investment in old age rather than the other way around."
24040999,"Complementary cognitive capabilities, economic decision making, and aging",Ye Li,"Fluid intelligence decreases with age, yet evidence about age declines in decision-making quality is mixed: Depending on the study, older adults make worse, equally good, or even better decisions than younger adults. We propose a potential explanation for this puzzle, namely that age differences in decision performance result from the interplay between two sets of cognitive capabilities that impact decision making, one in which older adults fare worse (i.e., fluid intelligence) and one in which they fare better (i.e., crystallized intelligence). Specifically, we hypothesized that older adults' higher levels of crystallized intelligence can provide an alternate pathway to good decisions when the fluid intelligence pathway declines. The performance of older adults relative to younger adults therefore depends on the relative importance of each type of intelligence for the decision at hand. We tested this complementary capabilities hypothesis in a broad sample of younger and older adults, collecting a battery of standard cognitive measures and measures of economically important decision-making ""traits""--including temporal discounting, loss aversion, financial literacy, and debt literacy. We found that older participants performed as well as or better than younger participants on these four decision-making measures. Structural equation modeling verified our hypothesis: Older participants' greater crystallized intelligence offset their lower levels of fluid intelligence for temporal discounting, financial literacy, and debt literacy, but not for loss aversion. These results have important implications for public policy and for the design of effective decision environments for older adults."
24040996,A statistical reevaluation of the data used in the Lanphear et al. ( 2005 ) pooled-analysis that related low levels of blood lead to intellectual deficits in children,Kenny S Crump,"A pooled-analysis by Lanphear et al. (2005) of seven cohort studies of the association between blood lead (BPb) concentrations in children and measures of their intelligence concluded that ""environmental lead exposure in children who have maximal blood lead levels <7.5 μg/dL is associated with intellectual deficits."" This study has played a prominent role in shaping the public understanding of the effects upon children's IQ of low BPb exposures (e.g., BPb ≤ 10 μg/dL). Here we present a reanalysis of the data used by Lanphear et al. to evaluate the robustness of their conclusions. Our analysis differed from that of Lanphear et al. primarily in how we controlled for non-lead variables (allowing a number of them to be site-specific), how we defined summary measures of BPb exposure, and in how we decided which BPb measures and transformations best modeled the data. We also reproduced the Lanphear et al. analysis. Although we found some small errors and questionable decisions by Lanphear et al. that, taken alone, could cause doubt in their conclusions, our reanalysis tended to support their conclusions. We concluded that there was statistical evidence that the exposure-response is non-linear over the full range of BPb evaluated in these studies, which implies that, for a given increase in blood lead, the associated IQ decrement is greater at lower BPb levels. However at BPb below 10 µg/dL, the exposure-response is adequately modeled as linear. We also found statistical evidence for an association with IQ among children who had maximal measured BPb levels ≤7 μg/dL, and concurrent BPb levels as low as ≤5 μg/dL."
24016767,Relationship between anthropometric indicators and cognitive performance in Southeast Asian school-aged children,Sandjaja,"Nutrition is an important factor in mental development and, as a consequence, in cognitive performance. Malnutrition is reflected in children's weight, height and BMI curves. The present cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the association between anthropometric indices and cognitive performance in 6746 school-aged children (aged 6-12 years) of four Southeast Asian countries: Indonesia; Malaysia; Thailand; Vietnam. Cognitive performance (non-verbal intelligence quotient (IQ)) was measured using Raven's Progressive Matrices test or Test of Non-Verbal Intelligence, third edition (TONI-3). Height-for-age z-scores (HAZ), weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) and BMI-for-age z-scores (BAZ) were used as anthropometric nutritional status indices. Data were weighted using age, sex and urban/rural weight factors to resemble the total primary school-aged population per country. Overall, 21% of the children in the four countries were underweight and 19% were stunted. Children with low WAZ were 3·5 times more likely to have a non-verbal IQ < 89 (OR 3·53 and 95% CI 3·52, 3·54). The chance of having a non-verbal IQ < 89 was also doubled with low BAZ and HAZ. In contrast, except for severe obesity, the relationship between high BAZ and IQ was less clear and differed per country. The odds of having non-verbal IQ levels < 89 also increased with severe obesity. In conclusion, undernourishment and non-verbal IQ are significantly associated in 6-12-year-old children. Effective strategies to improve nutrition in preschoolers and school-aged children can have a pronounced effect on cognition and, in the longer term, help in positively contributing to individual and national development."
24039228,Empathic responsiveness of children and adolescents with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder,Anke M Scheeren,"Previous studies have shown reduced empathic responsiveness to others' emotions in preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and an intellectual disability. However, age and intelligence may promote children's empathic responsiveness. Therefore, we examined the empathic responsiveness in normally intelligent school-aged children and adolescents with a clinical diagnosis of ASD (n = 151) and in a typically developing comparison group (n = 50), using structured observations and parent reports. Based on the observations, participants' responses to the emotional displays of an interviewer were surprisingly similar. However, compared with parents from the comparison group, parents of a child with ASD reported significantly fewer empathic responses, particularly when the child received a high score on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Even though parents report a reduced empathic responsiveness in school-aged children and adolescents with ASD, it may be difficult to find these empathic limitations during brief observations in a structured setting."
24039108,Cognitive function in children with brain tumors in the first year after diagnosis compared to healthy matched controls,Robert I Shortman,"Background: Improved survival of children with brain tumors (BTs) has increased focus on ameliorating morbidity. To reduce the risk of progressive cognitive decline, remedial strategies need to be instituted early, based upon accurate appraisal of need, yet few studies have investigated cognition in BT children early post-diagnosis. The study aims were to investigate cognition in children with primary BTs 1, 6, and 12 months post-diagnosis compared with healthy children, exploring the impact of disease and treatment variables. Methods: Forty-eight children aged 2-16 years with primary BTs, referred to a Regional Neurosurgical Unit over the 2-year study period were eligible for enrollment. The ""best friends"" model was used to recruit matched controls. Cognition was assessed using age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence scales; Children's Memory Scale; Test of Everyday Attention for Children, and Wechsler Quicktest. Results: Patients with BTs had significantly reduced performance compared to controls early post-diagnosis in tests of Performance IQ, processing speed, verbal and visual memory, and selective attention. Improved performance over 12 months was seen in patients with BTs although also, for some measures, in controls. Significant deficits in cognitive performance were seen one year post-diagnosis for Verbal IQ; processing speed, visual and verbal immediate memory, and selective attention. Infratentorial site, high tumor grade, hydrocephalus, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were associated with poorer functioning. Conclusion: Early cognitive impairment is present in BT children, sometimes prior to radiotherapy/chemotherapy treatment, and is associated with hydrocephalus, high tumor grade and infratentorial site. Future studies should investigate the role of early rehabilitation in improving cognition."
24038793,Genes contributing to subcortical volumes and intellectual ability implicate the thalamus,Marc M Bohlken,"It has been shown that brain volume and general intellectual ability are to a significant extent influenced by the same genetic factors. Several cortical regions of the brain also show a genetic correlation with intellectual ability, demonstrating that intellectual functioning is probably represented in a heritable distributed network of cortical regions throughout the brain. This study is the first to investigate a genetic association between subcortical volumes and intellectual ability, taking into account the thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens using an extended twin design. Genetic modeling was performed on a healthy adult twin sample consisting of 106 twin pairs and 30 of their siblings, IQ data was obtained from 132 subjects. Our results demonstrate that of all subcortical volumes measured, only thalamus volume is significantly correlated with intellectual functioning. Importantly, the association found between thalamus volume and intellectual ability is significantly influenced by a common genetic factor. This genetic factor is also implicated in cerebral brain volume. The thalamus, with its widespread cortical connections, may thus play a key role in human intelligence."
24038774,White matter microstructure correlates of mathematical giftedness and intelligence quotient,Francisco J Navas-Sánchez,"Recent functional neuroimaging studies have shown differences in brain activation between mathematically gifted adolescents and controls. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between mathematical giftedness, intelligent quotient (IQ), and the microstructure of white matter tracts in a sample composed of math-gifted adolescents and aged-matched controls. Math-gifted subjects were selected through a national program based on detecting enhanced visuospatial abilities and creative thinking. We used diffusion tensor imaging to assess white matter microstructure in neuroanatomical connectivity. The processing included voxel-wise and region of interest-based analyses of the fractional anisotropy (FA), a parameter which is purportedly related to white matter microstructure. In a whole-sample analysis, IQ showed a significant positive correlation with FA, mainly in the corpus callosum, supporting the idea that efficient information transfer between hemispheres is crucial for higher intellectual capabilities. In addition, math-gifted adolescents showed increased FA (adjusted for IQ) in white matter tracts connecting frontal lobes with basal ganglia and parietal regions. The enhanced anatomical connectivity observed in the forceps minor and splenium may underlie the greater fluid reasoning, visuospatial working memory, and creative capabilities of these children."
24037595,Influence of gender membership on sequential decisions of face attractiveness,Aki Kondo,"Responses in a current trial are biased by the stimulus and response in the preceding trial. In a mixed-category sequence, the sequential dependency is weaker when the stimuli of the current and preceding trials fall under different categories. In the present study, we investigated the influence of the gender membership of faces on the sequential dependency. Forty-eight pictures of male and female faces were presented successively. Participants rated the attractiveness, roundness, or intelligence of each face on a 7-point scale. The sequential effect was robustly observed, irrespective of the property to be judged. However, between-gender sequential dependency was weaker than within-gender dependency only in the attractiveness judgment. These findings suggest that the gender of faces serves as a cue for forming category representations when face attractiveness is of interest, and hence that the formation of categories in sequential decisions is an adaptive process that depends on the property to be judged."
24036169,Voluntary aerobic exercise increases the cognitive enhancing effects of working memory training,Andrew M Smith,"Increases in performance on tests of attention and learning are often observed shortly after a period of aerobic exercise, and evidence suggests that humans who engage in regular exercise are partially protected from age-related cognitive decline. However, the cognitive benefits of exercise are typically short-lived, limiting the practical application of these observations. Here, we explored whether physical exercise might induce lasting changes in general cognitive ability if that exercise was combined with working memory training, which is purported to broadly impact cognitive performance. Mice received either exercise treatment (6 weeks of voluntary running wheel access), working memory training (in a dual radial-arm maze), both treatments, or various control treatments. After this period of exercise, working memory training was initiated (alternating with days of exercise), and continued for several weeks. Upon completion of these treatments, animals were assessed (2-4 weeks later) for performance on four diverse learning tasks, and the aggregate performance of individual animals across all four learning tasks was estimated. Working memory training alone promoted small increases in general cognitive performance, although any beneficial effects of exercise alone had dissipated by the time of learning assessments. However, the two treatments in combination more than doubled the improvement in general cognitive performance supported by working memory training alone. Unlike the transient effects that acute aerobic exercise can have on isolated learning tasks, these results indicate that an acute period of exercise combined with working memory training can have synergistic and lasting impact on general cognitive performance."
24036120,"Emotional intelligence, emotions, and feelings of support staff working with clients with intellectual disabilities and challenging behavior: an exploratory study",Linda J M Zijlmans,"Working with clients who show challenging behavior can be emotionally demanding and stressful for support staff, because this behavior may cause a range of negative emotional reactions and feelings. These reactions are of negative influence on staff wellbeing and behavior. Research has focused on negative emotions of staff. However, a distinction between emotions and feelings has never been made in the research field of intellectual disabilities. Negative emotions and feelings may be regulated by emotional intelligence, a psychological construct that takes into account personal style and individual differences. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between emotional intelligence on the one hand and emotions and feelings on the other. Participants were 207 support staff serving clients with moderate to borderline intellectual disabilities and challenging behavior. Emotional intelligence, emotions, and feelings were measured with questionnaires. The results show that emotional intelligence, emotions, and feelings are related. However, found relationships were weak. Most significant relations were found between feelings and stress management and adaptation elements of emotional intelligence. Because the explored variables can change over time they call for a longitudinal research approach."
24035970,The role of metabolomics in neonatal and pediatric laboratory medicine,Michele Mussap,"Metabolomics consists of the quantitative analysis of a large number of low molecular mass metabolites involving substrates or products in metabolic pathways existing in all living systems. The analysis of the metabolic profile detectable in a human biological fluid allows to instantly identify changes in the composition of endogenous and exogenous metabolites caused by the interaction between specific physiopathological states, gene expression, and environment. In pediatrics and neonatology, metabolomics offers new encouraging perspectives for the improvement of critically ill patient outcome, for the early recognition of metabolic profiles associated with the development of diseases in the adult life, and for delivery of individualized medicine. In this view, nutrimetabolomics, based on the recognition of specific cluster of metabolites associated with nutrition and pharmacometabolomics, based on the capacity to personalize drug therapy by analyzing metabolic modifications due to therapeutic treatment may open new frontiers in the prevention and in the treatment of pediatric and neonatal diseases. This review summarizes the most relevant results published in the literature on the application of metabolomics in pediatric and neonatal clinical settings. However, there is the urgent need to standardize physiological and preanalytical variables, analytical methods, data processing, and result presentation, before establishing the definitive clinical value of results."
24035255,No association between catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Japanese children,Chiho Yatsuga,"Objective: This study ascertained the association between attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in Japanese children and a polymorphism of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a dopamine-control gene. The secondary aim of the study was the evaluation of a putative association between methylphenidate (MPH) effect/adverse effects and the COMT genotype. Methods: To ascertain the distribution of the Val158Met variant of COMT, 50 children meeting ADHD inclusion criteria were compared with 32 healthy children. Clinical improvement and the occurrence of adverse effects were measured before and 3 months after MPH administration in children with ADHD, and analyzed for genotype association. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition (WISC-III), age, MPH dose were included as co-variables. Results: The occurrence of the COMT Val/Val genotype was significantly higher in children with ADHD (χ(2)(1)=7.13, p<0.01). However, there was no significant difference in the Val/Val genotype according to disorder, and WISC and ADHD rating scale scores, after correcting for the interaction between disorder and COMT genotype. Furthermore, no significant difference in MPH effect/adverse effects was observed in association with the COMT genotype in the ADHD group. Conclusions: These results showed a lack of association between the COMT Val/Val genotype and ADHD in Japan."
24034914,Clinical features and comorbidities of Asperger syndrome in children],Xiao-Yan Fu,"Objective: To investigate and summarize the clinical features and comorbidities of Asperger syndrome (AS) in children and to provide a theoretical basis for improving the understanding and diagnosis of AS. Methods: Inquiry of medical history, physical examination, behavioral observation, psychiatric examination, questionnaire survey, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale were used to summarize and analyse the clinical data of 95 children with AS, including chief complaint, symptoms, perinatal and familial conditions, family genetic history, and common comorbidities. Results: AS was more common in male children, with hyperactivity, inattention, and social withdrawal as frequent chief complaints. The main clinical manifestations included poor communication skills (95%), restricted interest (82%), repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior (77%), semantic comprehension deficit (74%), and indiscipline (68%). Verbal IQ was higher than performance IQ in most patients. The comorbidities of AS included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (39%), emotional disorder (18%), and schizophrenia (2%); emotional disorder was more common in patients aged 13-16 years, while ADHD was more common in patients aged 7-16 years. Among these patients, 61% had fathers with introverted personality, 43% had mothers with introverted personality, and 19% had a family history of mental illness. Conclusions: AS has specific clinical manifestations. It is essential to know more about the clinical features and comorbidities of AS, which is helpful for early identification and diagnosis of AS."
24034473,Prospective memory impairment and its implications for community living skills in bipolar disorder,Raymond W C Au,"Objective: Prospective memory (PM) refers to the ability to undertake intended actions in the future. The functional significance of PM in bipolar disorder (BD) has not yet been investigated. This study examined PM impairment and its role in community living skills in clinically stable individuals with BD. Methods: Seventy-six individuals with BD and 44 healthy individuals were assessed with the Chinese version of the Cambridge Prospective Memory Test. Socio-demographic characteristics, retrospective memory (RM; the ability to recall or recognize past information), and intelligence were also measured in all participants. The clinical condition and community living skills of patients with BD were rated independently with standardized instruments. Results: Patients with BD showed PM impairment and their PM total scores independently predicted the level of community living skills in regression analyses. In follow-up analyses, the contribution was found to be accounted for by the time-based PM scores. Conclusions: Given the expanding body of research on the utility of PM in predicting functioning, these findings further support the role of PM in community living skills in individuals with BD. The results suggest that PM training might be an integral part of clinical rehabilitation devised for individuals with BD."
24034354,Deformations of amygdala morphology in familial pediatric bipolar disorder,Ryan Kelley,"Objective: Smaller amygdalar volumes have been consistently observed in pediatric bipolar disorder subjects compared to healthy control subjects. Whether smaller amygdalar volume is a consequence or antecedent of the first episode of mania is not known. Additionally, smaller volume has not been localized to specific amygdala subregions. Methods: We compared surface contour maps of the amygdala between 22 youths at high risk for bipolar disorder, 26 youths meeting full diagnostic criteria for pediatric familial bipolar disorder, and 24 healthy control subjects matched for age, gender, and intelligence quotient. Amygdalae were manually delineated on three-dimensional spoiled gradient echo images by a blinded rater using established tracing protocols. Statistical surface mesh modeling algorithms supported by permutation statistics were used to identify regional surface differences between the groups. Results: When compared to high-risk subjects and controls, youth with bipolar disorder showed surface deformations in specific amygdalar subregions, suggesting smaller volume of the basolateral nuclei. The high-risk subjects did not differ from controls in any subregion. Conclusions: These findings support previous reports of smaller amygdala volume in pediatric bipolar disorder and map the location of abnormality to specific amygdala subregions. These subregions have been associated with fear conditioning and emotion-enhanced memory. The absence of amygdala size abnormalities in youth at high risk for bipolar disorder suggests that reductions might occur after the onset of mania."
24033636,A systematic review and quantitative analysis of neurocognitive outcomes in children with four chronic illnesses,Joanna J Moser,"Background: Concern has been expressed that infants and children exposed to uneventful surgery and anesthesia may incur neurological injury that becomes manifest in poor scholastic performance or future learning difficulties. A recent meta-analysis of seven clinical studies examined the relationship between learning or behavior difficulties and pediatric exposure to anesthesia/surgery and reported an odds ratio of 1.4; however, the level of association and causal factors remain unclear. The purpose of our study is to provide context to the pediatric anesthesia neurotoxicity question by reviewing the evidence linking four childhood illnesses with neurocognitive development. In the present review, we have sought to quantify the magnitude of the impact of chronic illness on neurocognitive development through a systematic review of publications that report the developmental trajectory of patients with four childhood diseases: cystic fibrosis (CF), hemophilia A, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Methods: Studies were identified by searching the electronic databases OVID MEDLINE and Pubmed and scanning reference lists of articles by two authors. Limits were applied to the English language and to humans. We used the following search terms: CF, hemophilia A, ESRD, ESLD in combination with academic performance, educational status, educational measurement, learning, achievement, developmental delay, learning disabilities, intellectual disabilities, behavioral disorders, intelligence quotient (IQ), cognition, school problems, absenteeism, school attendance, anxiety, learning regression, or developmental regression. The search strategy was reviewed independently by all four authors. Eligibility assessment was performed independently in an unblinded standardized manner by two authors who chose relevant articles from the overall search results by scanning the titles and abstracts of articles and from the references within citations. The full-text publications were reviewed by all four authors. All pertinent data related to the objectives were collected and independently reviewed by two authors. The data were summarized in the form reported in the studies. When possible, reported data were submitted to analysis with the Mantel-Haenszel method using a random effects model. Analyses were performed using the Review Manager computer program. Results: In the studies retrieved, the main outcomes were measures of intellectual or cognitive characteristics, as exemplified by the Wechsler battery of tests. Reporting of measures of achievement (for example, GPA) was rare. Children with CF and hemophilia A did not appear disadvantaged by their disease as general intelligence levels were comparable with the general population norms. In children with ESRD, mean IQ reported during dialysis improved after transplantation. Although they improved relative to their pretransplantation cognitive functioning, children with ESLD who received transplants are approximately eight IQ points below the population norm. Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest that the burden of chronic childhood illness, by itself, does not impair cognitive development in children with hemophilia A and CF. Children with ESRD and ESLD, despite optimal management, show a mild cognitive deficit compared with the population norm. Given the impact of these four specific chronic illnesses on neurocognitive outcome in children and the improvement in IQ post-transplant in both ESRD and ESLD, the results suggest that the effect of an uncontrolled confounding illness on neurocognitive development is small."
24032705,Selective amygdalohippocampectomy versus anterior temporal lobectomy in the management of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy: a meta-analysis of comparative studies,Wen-Han Hu,"Object: Whether selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH) has similar seizure outcomes and better neuropsychological outcomes compared with anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) is a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to compare the 2 types of surgery with respect to seizure outcomes and changes in IQ scores. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies published between January 1990 and September 2012. Studies comparing SelAH and ATL with respect to seizure and intelligence outcomes were included. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the included studies and independently extracted the data. Odds ratios and standardized mean deviations with 95% confidence intervals were used to compare pooled proportions of freedom from seizures and changes in IQ scores between the SelAH and ATL groups. Results: Three prospective and 10 retrospective studies were identified involving 745 and 766 patients who underwent SelAH and ATL, respectively. The meta-analysis demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the odds of seizure freedom for patients who underwent SelAH compared with those who underwent ATL (OR 0.65 [95% CI 0.51-0.82], p = 0.0005). The differences between the changes in all IQ scores after the 2 types of surgery were not statistically significant, regardless of the side of resection. Conclusions: Selective amygdalohippocampectomy statistically reduced the odds of being seizure free compared with ATL, but the clinical significance of this reduction needs to be further validated by well-designed randomized trials. Selective amygdalohippocampectomy did not have better outcomes than ATL with respect to intelligence."
24032188,Impacts on tiptoe deformity and intelligent development in spasmodic cerebral palsy treated with acupuncture at naoqing xue (extra)],Yong Zhang,"Objective: To assess the impacts on tiptoe deformity and intelligent development in spasmodic cerebral palsy treated with acupuncture at Naoqing Xue (Extra). Methods: One hundred and forty-six children with spasmodic cerebral palsy were randomized into a Naoqing Xue group (74 cases) and a control group (72 cases). On the basic treatment (scalp acupuncture, sport therapy), in the Naoqing Xue group, acupuncture at Naoqing Xue (Extra) was applied. In the control group, acupuncture was given at Jiexi (ST 41), Yanglingquan (GB 34) and Sanyinjiao (SP 6). In the two groups, acupuncture was given once every two days, 10 treatments made one session, at the interval of 15 days between two sessions. Three sessions of treatment were given continuously. Before treatment and after 3 sessions of treatment, the angle measurement of ankle passive dorsiflexion, comprehensive spasm scale (CSS) and Gesell intelligence test were adopted for the rehabilitation assessment. Additionally, 30 min after the end of the first acupuncture treatment, the angle measurement of ankle passive dorsiflexion and CSS were applied to assess the immediate effect of the therapeutic methods of the two groups. Results: The immediate effect of the angle measurement of ankle passive dorsiflexion and CSS as well as the effect after 3 sessions of treatment in the Naoqing Xue group were all superior to those in the control group (all P < 0.05). In 3 sessions of treatment, the development quotients of social adaptive behavior and personal social activation function in Gesell intelligence test in the Naoqing Xue group were all higher than those in the control group (all P < 0.05). The development quotients of major movement, fine motion and language were not different significantly as compared with those in the control group (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Acupuncture at Naoqing Xue (Extra) relieves tiptoe deformity and promotes intelligent development for the children with spasmodic cerebral palsy."
24030781,IQdb: an intelligence quotient score-associated gene resource for human intelligence,Lei Kong,"Intelligence quotient (IQ) is the most widely used phenotype to characterize human cognitive abilities. Recent advances in studies on human intelligence have identified many new susceptibility genes. However, the genetic mechanisms involved in IQ score and the relationship between IQ score and the risk of mental disorders have won little attention. To address the genetic complexity of IQ score, we have developed IQdb (http://IQdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn), a publicly available database for exploring IQ-associated human genes. In total, we collected 158 experimental verified genes from literature as a core dataset in IQdb. In addition, 46 genomic regions related to IQ score have been curated from literature. Based on the core dataset and 46 confirmed linked genomic regions, more than 6932 potential IQ-related genes are expanded using data of protein-protein interactions. A systematic gene ranking approach was applied to all the collected and expanded genes to represent the relative importance of all the 7090 genes in IQdb. Our further systematic pathway analysis reveals that IQ-associated genes are significantly enriched in multiple signal events, especially related to cognitive systems. Of the 158 genes in the core dataset, 81 are involved in various psychotic and mental disorders. This comprehensive gene resource illustrates the importance of IQdb to our understanding on human intelligence, and highlights the utility of IQdb for elucidating the functions of IQ-associated genes and the cross-talk mechanisms among cognition-related pathways in some mental disorders for community.

24029684,Is obesity associated with a decline in intelligence quotient during the first half of the life course?,Daniel W Belsky,"Cross-sectional studies have found that obesity is associated with low intellectual ability and neuroimaging abnormalities in adolescence and adulthood. Some have interpreted these associations to suggest that obesity causes intellectual decline in the first half of the life course. We analyzed data from a prospective longitudinal study to test whether becoming obese was associated with intellectual decline from childhood to midlife. We used data from the ongoing Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, a population-representative birth cohort study of 1,037 children in New Zealand who were followed prospectively from birth (1972-1973) through their fourth decade of life with a 95% retention rate. Intelligence quotient (IQ) was measured in childhood and adulthood. Anthropometric measurements were taken at birth and at 12 subsequent in-person assessments. As expected, cohort members who became obese had lower adulthood IQ scores. However, obese cohort members exhibited no excess decline in IQ. Instead, these cohort members had lower IQ scores since childhood. This pattern remained consistent when we accounted for children's birth weights and growth during the first years of life, as well as for childhood-onset obesity. Lower IQ scores among children who later developed obesity were present as early as 3 years of age. We observed no evidence that obesity contributed to a decline in IQ, even among obese individuals who displayed evidence of the metabolic syndrome and/or elevated systemic inflammation."
24028956,The biochemistry of memory,Jeffry B Stock,"Almost fifty years ago, Julius Adler initiated a program of research to gain insights into the basic biochemistry of intelligent behavior by studying the molecular mechanisms that underlie the chemotactic responses of Escherichia coli. All living organisms share elements of a common biochemistry for metabolism, growth and heredity - why not intelligence? Neurobiologists have demonstrated that this is the case for nervous systems in animals ranging from worms to man. Motile unicellular organisms such as E. coli exhibit rudimentary behaviors that can be loosely described in terms of cognitive phenomena such as memory and learning. Adler's initiative at least raised the prospect that, because of the numerous experimental advantages provided by E. coli, it would be the first organism whose behavior could be understood at molecular resolution."
24028694,"Improving quality and safety of care using ""technovigilance"": an ethnographic case study of secondary use of data from an electronic prescribing and decision support system",Mary Dixon-Woods,"Context: ""Meaningful use"" of electronic health records to improve quality of care has remained understudied. We evaluated an approach to improving patients' safety and quality of care involving the secondary use of data from a hospital electronic prescribing and decision support system (ePDSS). Methods: We conducted a case study of a large English acute care hospital with a well-established ePDSS. Our study was based on ethnographic observations of clinical settings (162 hours) and meetings (28 hours), informal conversations with clinical staff, semistructured interviews with ten senior executives, and the collection of relevant documents. Our data analysis was based on the constant comparative method. Findings: This hospital's approach to quality and safety could be characterized as ""technovigilance."" It involved treating the ePDSS as a warehouse of data on clinical activity and performance. The hospital converted the secondary data into intelligence about the performance of individuals, teams, and clinical services and used this as the basis of action for improvement. Through a combination of rapid audit, feedback to clinical teams, detailed and critical review of apparent omissions in executive-led meetings, a focus on personal professional responsibility for patients' safety and quality care, and the correction of organizational or systems defects, technovigilance was-based on the hospital's own evidence-highly effective in improving specific indicators. Measures such as the rate of omitted doses of medication showed marked improvement. As do most interventions, however, technovigilance also had unintended consequences. These included the risk of focusing attention on aspects of patient safety made visible by the system at the expense of other, less measurable but nonetheless important, concerns. Conclusions: The secondary use of electronic data can be effective for improving specific indicators of care if accompanied by a range of interventions to ensure proper interpretation and appropriate action. But care is needed to avoid unintended consequences."
24028487,Assessing effort: differentiating performance and symptom validity,Sarah A Van Dyke,"The current study aimed to clarify the relationship among the constructs involved in neuropsychological assessment, including cognitive performance, symptom self-report, performance validity, and symptom validity. Participants consisted of 120 consecutively evaluated individuals from a veteran's hospital with mixed referral sources. Measures included the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition Full Scale IQ (WAIS-IV FSIQ), California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II), Trail Making Test Part B (TMT-B), Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM), Medical Symptom Validity Test (MSVT), WAIS-IV Reliable Digit Span (RDS), Post-traumatic Check List-Military Version (PCL-M), MMPI-2 F scale, MMPI-2 Symptom Validity Scale (FBS), MMPI-2 Response Bias Scale (RBS), and the Postconcussive Symptom Questionnaire (PCSQ). Six different models were tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to determine the factor model describing the relationships between cognitive performance, symptom self-report, performance validity, and symptom validity. The strongest and most parsimonious model was a three-factor model in which cognitive performance, performance validity, and self-reported symptoms (including both standard and symptom validity measures) were separate factors. The findings suggest failure in one validity domain does not necessarily invalidate the other domain. Thus, performance validity and symptom validity should be evaluated separately."
24028185,"Neuropsychological and neurobehavioral outcome following childhood arterial ischemic stroke: attention deficits, emotional dysregulation, and executive dysfunction",Fiadhnait O'Keeffe,"Objectives: To investigate neuropsychological and neurobehavioral outcome in children with arterial ischemic stroke (AIS). Background: Childhood stroke can have consequences on motor, cognitive, and behavioral development. We present a cross-sectional study of neuropsychological and neurobehavioral outcome at least one year poststroke in a uniquely homogeneous sample of children who had experienced AIS. Method: Forty-nine children with AIS aged 6 to 18 years were recruited from a specialist clinic. Neuropsychological measures of intelligence, reading comprehension, attention, and executive function were administered. A triangulation of data collection included questionnaires completed by the children, their parents, and teachers, rating behavior, executive functions, and emotions. Key findings: Focal neuropsychological vulnerabilities in attention (response inhibition and dual attention) and executive function were found, beyond general intellectual functioning, irrespective of hemispheric side of stroke. Difficulties with emotional and behavioral regulation were also found. Consistent with an ""early plasticity"" hypothesis, earlier age of stroke was associated with better performance on measures of executive function. Conclusions: A significant proportion of children poststroke are at long-term risk of difficulties with emotional regulation, executive function, and attention. Data also suggest that executive functions are represented in widespread networks in the developing brain and are vulnerable to unilateral injury."
24027343,Responses of chimpanzees to cues of conspecific observation,Daniel Nettle,"Recent evidence has shown that humans are remarkably sensitive to artificial cues of conspecific observation when making decisions with potential social consequences. Whether similar effects are found in other great apes has not yet been investigated. We carried out two experiments in which individual chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, took items of food from an array in the presence of either an image of a large conspecific face or a scrambled control image. In experiment 1 we compared three versions of the face image varying in size and the amount of the face displayed. In experiment 2 we compared a fourth variant of the image with more prominent coloured eyes displayed closer to the focal chimpanzee. The chimpanzees did not look at the face images significantly more than at the control images in either experiment. Although there were trends for some individuals in each experiment to be slower to take high-value food items in the face conditions, these were not consistent or robust. We suggest that the extreme human sensitivity to cues of potential conspecific observation may not be shared with chimpanzees."
24026376,Emotional intelligence and psychiatry residents: does the PRITE measure emotional intelligence?,Lindsey Schrimpf,"Objective: The authors assessed the relationship between Emotional Intelligence (EI) and Psychiatry Resident In-Training Exam (PRITE) scores. EI is important to the therapeutic alliance. The hypothesis tested was that PRITE scores would correlate with EI. Method: Adult Psychiatry residents participated. The PRITE was administered, and participants completed the online Bar-On Emotional Intelligence Quotient questionnaire. Results: Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for PRITE score and overall EI score, and with the 15 EI subscales. The correlation for PRITE and overall EI was not significant. Three EI subscales had statistically significant correlations with PRITE score: empathy, social responsibility, and impulse control. Conclusions: There was no significant correlation between overall EI and PRITE scores. There was an inverse relationship between PRITE scores and empathy, social responsibility, and impulse control. The authors discuss possible explanations for these relationships."
24025628,Effect of iodine supplementation in pregnancy on child development and other clinical outcomes: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials,Shao J Zhou,"Background: Routine iodine supplementation during pregnancy is recommended by leading health authorities worldwide, even in countries where the iodine status of the population is sufficient. Objectives: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of iodine supplementation during pregnancy or the periconceptional period on the development and growth of children. Secondary outcomes included pregnancy outcome and thyroid function. Design: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted. PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched to identify relevant RCTs. Results: Fourteen publications that involved 8 trials met the inclusion criteria. Only 2 included trials reported the growth and development of children and clinical outcomes. Iodine supplementation during pregnancy or the periconceptional period in regions of severe iodine deficiency reduced risk of cretinism, but there were no improvements in childhood intelligence, gross development, growth, or pregnancy outcomes, although there was an improvement in some motor functions. None of the remaining 6 RCTs conducted in regions of mild to moderate iodine deficiency reported childhood development or growth or pregnancy outcomes. Effects of iodine supplementation on the thyroid function of mothers and their children were inconsistent. Conclusions: In this review, we highlight a lack of quality evidence of the effect of prenatal or periconceptional iodine supplementation on growth and cognitive function of children. Although contemporary RCTs of iodine supplementation with outcomes addressing childhood development are indicated, conduct of such RCTs may not be feasible in populations where iodine supplementation in pregnancy is widely practiced."
24025439,Requirements for and impact of a serious game for neuro-pediatric robot-assisted gait training,Rob Labruyère,"We investigated whether children with neurological gait disorders who walked in a driven gait orthosis could adjust their participation level according to the demands of a newly developed rehabilitation game. We further investigated if cognitive capacity and motor impairment influenced game performance. Nineteen children with neurological gait disorders (mean age: 13.4 y, 42% girls) participated. To quantify game participation, electromyographic muscle activity (M. rectus femoris) and heart rate were compared in a demanding part and a less demanding part of the game. Cognitive capacity was assessed with the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (TONI-4). Furthermore, the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM), Manual Muscle Tests and a therapist-derived score of how well the child was able to train were assessed. Results showed that muscle activity and heart rate were higher during the demanding part of the game (30.7 ± 22.6 μV; 129.4 ± 15.7 bpm) compared to the less demanding part (16.0 ± 13.4 μV; 124.1 ± 15.9 bpm; p<0.01 for both measures). Game performance correlated moderately with the TONI-4 (r=0.50, p=0.04) and the cognition subscale of the WeeFIM (ρ=0.59, p=0.01). The therapist-derived score correlated significantly with game performance (p=0.75, p<0.01) and the ability to modify muscle activity to the demands of the game (p=-0.72, p<0.01). Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that the latter factor differentiated well between those children suitable for the game and those not. We conclude that children with neurological gait disorders are able to modify their activity to the demands of the VR-scenario. However, cognitive function and motor impairment determine to which extent. These results are important for clinical decision-making."
24025435,Enumeration skills in Down syndrome,Francesco Sella,"Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) exhibit various math difficulties which can be ascribed both to global intelligence level and/or to their atypical cognitive profile. In this light, it is crucial to investigate whether DS display deficits in basic numerical skills. In the present study, individuals with DS and two groups of typically developing (TD) children matched for mental and chronological age completed two delayed match-to-sample tasks in order to evaluate the functioning of visual enumeration skills. Children with DS showed a specific deficit in the discrimination of small numerosities (within the subitizing range) with respect to both mental and chronological age matched TD children. In contrast, the discrimination of larger numerosities, though lower than that of chronological age matched controls, was comparable to that of mental age matched controls. Finally, counting was less fluent but the understanding of cardinality seemed to be preserved in DS. These results suggest a deficit of the object tracking system underlying the parallel individuation of small numerosities and a typical - but developmentally delayed - acuity of the approximate number system for discrimination of larger numerosities."
24025143,"Ornithine aspartate and naloxone combined therapy for hepatic encephalopathy affects cognitive function, prognosis, and neuropeptide levels]",Ze-wen Zhou,"Objective: To investigate the potential effects on cognitive function, prognosis, and neuropeptide levels of patients in response to combination therapy with ornithine aspartate plus naloxone for hepatic encephalopathy. Methods: Eighty-four consecutive patients diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy were randomly divided into two equal groups. The control group (n = 42) received traditional medical treatment, and the research group (n = 42) received the traditional medical treatment as well as the combination therapy with ornithine aspartate plus naloxone. The supplemental treatment was comprised of daily intravenous injection of 10-15 g ornithine aspartate in 250 ml of 5% glucose plus intravenous drip of 3 mg naloxone in 100 ml of 5% glucose, and was given in 7-day cycles for one or two cycles. The cognitive function of patients was assessed by Hasegawa Intelligence Scale (HDS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) questionnaires. The effective rate and time duration from coma to consciousness were recorded. Changes in blood ammonia level, markers of liver function, and neuropeptide levels were measured by standard biochemical assays. Intergroup differences were assessed by the Chi-squared test. Results: The HDS and MMSE scores of the research group were significantly higher than those of the control group after therapy. The effective rate, time duration from coma to consciousness, blood ammonia, the liver function markers alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase and total bilirubin, and the neuropeptides arginine vasopressin and beta-endorphin were remarkably improved after treatment in the research group, as compared with that in the control group. Conclusion: Supplementing the traditional treatment for hepatic encephalopathy with ornithine aspartate plus naloxone combination therapy provides better therapeutic outcome than traditional treatment alone."
24024543,Exploring expressivity and emotion with artificial voice and speech technologies,Sandra Pauletto,"Emotion in audio-voice signals, as synthesized by text-to-speech (TTS) technologies, was investigated to formulate a theory of expression for user interface design. Emotional parameters were specified with markup tags, and the resulting audio was further modulated with post-processing techniques. Software was then developed to link a selected TTS synthesizer with an automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine, producing a chatbot that could speak and listen. Using these two artificial voice subsystems, investigators explored both artistic and psychological implications of artificial speech emotion. Goals of the investigation were interdisciplinary, with interest in musical composition, augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), commercial voice announcement applications, human-computer interaction (HCI), and artificial intelligence (AI). The work-in-progress points towards an emerging interdisciplinary ontology for artificial voices. As one study output, HCI tools are proposed for future collaboration."
24024311,Neuropsychological assessment of decision making in alcohol-dependent commercial pilots,Randy Georgemiller,"Background: The aim of this exploratory archival study was to discern the utility of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) in identifying adaptive decision-making capacities among pilots with a history of alcohol dependence both with and without Cluster B personality features. Methods: Participants included 18 male airmen at the rank of captain with a history of receiving alcohol dependence treatment and subsequent referral for a fitness-for-duty evaluation. Data from prior comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations conducted in a private practice setting at the mandate of the FAA utilizing criteria outlined in the HIMS program was used. ANOVA was conducted to compare pilots with (N = 4) and without Cluster B personality features (N = 14) on measures of decisionmaking capacities, intelligence, and executive functioning. Results: Pilots with Cluster B personality features were found to have a significantly lower Total Net T-Score on IGT (M = 35.00, SD = 9.27) than pilots without features of Cluster B (M = 56.36, SD = 9.55). Furthermore, with the exception of the first 20 cards (i.e., Net 1); the groups significantly differed in their Net scores. No statistically significant difference was found on airmen's intelligence and executive functioning. Discussion: The present study found that alcohol-dependent airmen with Cluster B personality features evidenced significantly poorer decisionmaking capacities as measured by the ICT in comparison to alcohol dependent airman without Cluster B personality features. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed."
24022995,Do children with autism re-enact object movements rather than imitate demonstrator actions?,Deborah M Custance,"It has been suggested that autism-specific imitative deficits may be reduced or even spared in object-related activities. However, most previous research has not sufficiently distinguished object movement reenactment (learning about the ways in which object move) from imitation (learning about the topography of demonstrated actions). Twenty children with autism (CWA) and 20 typically developing children (TDC) were presented with puzzle boxes containing prizes. Test objects and experimental conditions were designed to isolate object- and action-related aspects of demonstrations. There were four types of video demonstrations: (a) a full demonstration by an adult; (b) a ghost demonstration with object movements alone; (c) mimed solutions demonstrated adjacent to the objects; and (d) random actions performed on the surface of the objects. There were no significant between-group differences in the degree to which CWA and TDC matched the full demonstrations, the actual demonstrations or in their times to first solution in any of the conditions. Although there was no clear imitative deficit in the CWA, regression analyses were conducted to explore in more detail whether diagnosis, verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ), nonverbal IQ NVIQ, age or motor coordination predicted performance. The results are discussed in relation to the use of extrinsic vs. intrinsic rewards and the interplay between motor coordination and the relative rigidity vs. pliability of objects."
24022236,Neurocognitive effects of ketamine in treatment-resistant major depression: association with antidepressant response,James W Murrough,"Rationale: The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine has demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Despite the promise of a novel and urgently needed treatment for refractory depression, concerns regarding potential adverse neurocognitive effects of ketamine remain. Objectives: Although extensive research has been conducted in healthy volunteers, there is a paucity of studies examining the neurocognitive effects of ketamine in depressed patients. Therefore, the aims of the current study were to characterize the relationship between baseline neurocognition and antidepressant response to ketamine, measure the acute impact of ketamine on neurocognition, and investigate the relationship between acute neurocognitive effects of ketamine and antidepressant response. Methods: Neurocognitive functioning was assessed in 25 patients with TRD using a comprehensive battery: estimated premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ), current IQ, and tests from the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). A subset of the MCCB was repeated immediately following a 40-min intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). Results: Patients who responded to ketamine 24 h following treatment had poorer baseline neurocognitive performance relative to nonresponders and, in particular, slower processing speed (F = 8.42; df = 23; p = 0.008). Ketamine was associated with selective impairments in memory recall, and the degree of cognitive change carried negative prognostic significance (e.g., negative cognitive effects immediately after ketamine predicted lower response rate at 24 h; Fisher's exact test two-sided p = 0.027). Conclusions: Taken together, our findings suggest a potential baseline neurocognitive predictor of ketamine response and an inverse relationship between the cognitive effects of ketamine and antidepressant efficacy."
24021389,The ex-Gaussian distribution of reaction times in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,Shoou-Lian Hwang Gu,"We investigated the three parameters (mu, sigma, tau) of ex-Gaussian distribution of RT derived from the Conners' continuous performance test (CCPT) and examined the moderating effects of the energetic factors (the inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) and Blocks) among these three parameters, especially tau, an index describing the positive skew of RT distribution. We assessed 195 adolescents with DSM-IV ADHD, and 90 typically developing (TD) adolescents, aged 10-16. Participants and their parents received psychiatric interviews to confirm the diagnosis of ADHD and other psychiatric disorders. Participants also received intelligence (WISC-III) and CCPT assessments. We found that participants with ADHD had a smaller mu, and larger tau. As the ISI/Block increased, the magnitude of group difference in tau increased. Among the three ex-Gaussian parameters, tau was positively associated with omission errors, and mu was negatively associated with commission errors. The moderating effects of ISIs and Blocks on tau parameters suggested that the ex-Gaussian parameters could offer more information about the attention state in vigilance task, especially in ADHD."
24020859,Treating clients with Asperger's syndrome and autism,Alisa G Woods,"Asperger's syndrome (AS) is a form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affecting many individuals today. Although neurobiological correlates for AS have been identified, like many ASDs, AS is not completely understood. AS as a distinct disorder is also not universally accepted and in the DSM-5 AS is not considered a separate nosological entity. In contrast to some other ASDs, individuals with AS are commonly characterized by having standard or higher than average intelligence, yet difficulties in social skills and communication can present challenges for these individuals in everyday functioning. Counseling a person with AS or autism presents a unique challenge for the mental health care provider. We have compiled this review consisting of some recent ideas regarding counseling the client with AS with the goal of providing some clinical insights and practical clues. Although the focus of the present paper is largely on AS, many of these strategies could also apply to individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA)."
24020152,Smart grab bars: a potential initiative to encourage bath grab bar use in community dwelling older adults,Paulette Guitard,"Grab bars are often prescribed to ensure safe and independent bathing and toileting. Studies have shown that seniors do not always use grab bars when they are present or are reluctant to install them due to the associated stigma. This study sought to determine if artificial intelligence could increase grab bar use by seniors and to determine the efficacy of different cues (auditory, visual, and audiovisual combination) on the frequency of use of a grab bar. Sixty-nine healthy participants aged 60 to 86 years (average 68.7 years) were randomly assigned to three subgroups. Each subgroup tested two different cueing conditions: the no cue and one of three cued conditions (visual, auditory, or combined audio-visual). Results suggest that the smart grab increased seniors' grab bars use by 39% and that the effect was maintained after removal of the cues. Participants preferred the visual cue but the auditory cue was the most powerful. Results suggest that artificial intelligence may be an interesting avenue to increase grab bar use in community-dwelling older adults and in people requiring supervision to use grab bars on a regular basis to decrease the risk of falls during bathing or bathtub transfers."
24019507,Culture and behaviour in the English National Health Service: overview of lessons from a large multimethod study,Mary Dixon-Woods,"Background: Problems of quality and safety persist in health systems worldwide. We conducted a large research programme to examine culture and behaviour in the English National Health Service (NHS). Methods: Mixed-methods study involving collection and triangulation of data from multiple sources, including interviews, surveys, ethnographic case studies, board minutes and publicly available datasets. We narratively synthesised data across the studies to produce a holistic picture and in this paper present a high-level summary. Results: We found an almost universal desire to provide the best quality of care. We identified many 'bright spots' of excellent caring and practice and high-quality innovation across the NHS, but also considerable inconsistency. Consistent achievement of high-quality care was challenged by unclear goals, overlapping priorities that distracted attention, and compliance-oriented bureaucratised management. The institutional and regulatory environment was populated by multiple external bodies serving different but overlapping functions. Some organisations found it difficult to obtain valid insights into the quality of the care they provided. Poor organisational and information systems sometimes left staff struggling to deliver care effectively and disempowered them from initiating improvement. Good staff support and management were also highly variable, though they were fundamental to culture and were directly related to patient experience, safety and quality of care. Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of clear, challenging goals for high-quality care. Organisations need to put the patient at the centre of all they do, get smart intelligence, focus on improving organisational systems, and nurture caring cultures by ensuring that staff feel valued, respected, engaged and supported."
24018527,Issues of data governance associated with data mining in medical research: experiences from an empirical study,Jesmin Nahar,"This chapter is a review of data mining techniques used in medical research. It will cover the existing applications of these techniques in the identification of diseases, and also present the authors' research experiences in medical disease diagnosis and analysis. A computational diagnosis approach can have a significant impact on accurate diagnosis and result in time and cost effective solutions. The chapter will begin with an overview of computational intelligence concepts, followed by details on different classification algorithms. Use of association learning, a well recognised data mining procedure, will also be discussed. Many of the datasets considered in existing medical data mining research are imbalanced, and the chapter focuses on this issue as well. Lastly, the chapter outlines the need of data governance in this research domain."
24018099,Is the fluency of language outputs related to individual differences in intelligence and executive function?,Paul E Engelhardt,"There has been little research on the fluency of language production and individual difference variables, such as intelligence and executive function. In this study, we report data from 106 participants who completed a battery of standardized cognitive tasks and a sentence production task. For the sentence production task, participants were presented with two objects and a verb and their task was to formulate a sentence. Four types of disfluency were examined: filled pauses (e.g. uh, um), unfilled pauses, repetitions, and repairs. Repetitions occur when the speaker suspends articulation and then repeats the previous word/phrase, and repairs occur when the speaker suspends articulation and then starts over with a different word/phrase. Hierarchical structural equation modeling revealed a significant relationship between repair disfluencies and inhibition. Conclusions focus on the role of individual differences in cognitive ability and their role in models and theories of language production."
24016447,Risk factors related to mental disorder in patients with craniocerebral injury],Shui-qin Xu,"Objective: To explore the correlation between mental disorder and craniocerebral injury, and notifying its related risk factors. Methods: 342 patients from Sep. 2008 to Sep. 2012 with craniocerebral injury were selected and related clinical data on general their conditions, including sex, age, educational level, satisfaction on careers and relations to family were collected. All the patients received CT-scans to the head, IQ test, MQ test, SCID-1/P, PDQC and SCICP detection. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the general information and cerebral injurious conditions of patients regarding the incidence of mental disorders. Results: 249 patients with mental disorder were noticed out of the total 342 patients with craniocerebral injury, with the incidence rate as 72.8% including 117 depression (47.0%), 95 anxiety disorders (38.2%), 27 mania (10.8%), 69 intelligence and memory disorders (27.7%) cases. Data from correlation analysis showed that factors as sex, age, educational level, satisfaction on careers and family of patients as well as type, severity and location of the craniocerebral injuries appeared to have important correlation with mental disorder. Results: also showed that the age of patients (OR > 1.04), severity and location of the craniocerebral injuries (OR1 > 1.28, OR2 > 1.31) were independent risk factors (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The age of patients, severity and location of the craniocerebral injuries were independent risk factors for mental disorder in patients with craniocerebral injury."
24016117,George A. Miller (1920-2012),Steven Pinker,"Presents an obituary for George A. Miller (1920-2012). Miller ranks among the most important psychologists of the 20th century. In addition to writing one of the best known papers in the history of psychology (""The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information,"" published in Psychological Review in 1956), Miller also fomented the cognitive revolution, invented psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology, imported powerful ideas from the theories of information, communication, grammar, semantics, and artificial intelligence, and left us a sparkling oeuvre that proves that a rigorous scientist needn't write in soggy prose. Honors rained down on Miller. APA gave him the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions (1963), the American Psychological Foundation Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in Psychological Science (1990), the William James Book Award (1992, for The Science of Words), and the Award for Lifetime Contributions to Psychology (2003), and named a prize after him, as did the Cognitive Neuroscience Society. Miller was also honored by the Association for Psychological Science and the American Speech and Hearing Association. In 2000, he won the John P. McGovern Award in the Behavioral Sciences from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and in 1991, the National Medal of Science, the country's highest scientific honor."
24014166,Usefulness of parent-completed ASQ for neurodevelopmental screening of preterm children at five years of age,Marie Halbwachs,"Introduction: Preterm children are at greater risk of developmental impairment and require close follow-up for early and optimal medical care. Our goal was to examine use of the parent-completed Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) as a screening tool for neurodevelopmental disabilities in preterm infants at five years of age. Patients and methods: A total of 648 preterm children (<35 weeks gestational age) born between 2003 and 2004 and included in the regional Loire Infant Follow-up network were evaluated at five years of age. ASQ was compared with two validated tools (Intelligence Quotient and Global School Adaptation Score) and the impact of maternal education on the accuracy of this questionnaire was assessed. Results: Overall ASQ scores for predicting full-scale IQ<85 and GSA score produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73±0.03 and 0.77±0.03, respectively. An ASQ cut-off value of 285 had optimal discriminatory power for identifying children with IQ scores<85 and GSA scores in the first quintile. ASQ values<285 were significantly associated with a higher risk of non-optimal neurologic outcomes (sensitivity of 0.80, specificity of 0.54 for IQ<85). ASQ values>285 were not distinctive for mild delay or normal development. In children with developmental delay, no difference was found when ASQ scores according to maternal education levels were analyzed. Conclusions: ASQ at five years is a simple and cost-effective tool that can detect severe developmental delay in preterm children regardless of maternal education level, while its capacity to identify children with mild delay appears to be more limited."
24012511,Fine motor skills in children with rolandic epilepsy,Muhammed Ayaz,"This study aimed to evaluate fine motor skills in children with rolandic epilepsy (RE). The research included 44 children diagnosed with typical RE and 44 controls matched in terms of age, gender, and level of education. Fine motor skills were evaluated with the Purdue Pegboard Test, and intelligence was measured with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. After controlling for the effect of intelligence on fine motor skills, the results showed that the children with RE did not perform as well as the controls in the PPT dominant hand, both hands, and assembly subtests. Epileptic focus, treatment status, type of antiepileptic treatment, age at the time of the first seizure, time since the last seizure, and total number of seizures did not affect motor skills. Rolandic epilepsy negatively affected fine motor skills regardless of the children's level of intelligence."
24012225,Comparison of anxiety as reported by older people with intellectual disabilities and by older people with normal intelligence,Heidi Hermans,"Objectives: Older people with intellectual disabilities (ID) may experience more and different symptoms of anxiety than older people with normal intelligence. Study questions: (1) Is the reported severity of anxiety in this group similar to that in the general older population; (2) Are specific anxiety symptoms reported as frequently by both groups? Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Formal Dutch intellectual disability services and Dutch population-based study. Participants: One hundred fifty-four participants of the Healthy Ageing and Intellectual Disability study with mild or moderate ID (IQ <70), aged 55-85 years, and 2,917 participants of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam with normal intelligence, aged 55-85 years. Measurements: The general anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: Mean (standard deviation) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score of subjects with ID was significantly higher than that of subjects with normal intelligence (3.53 [3.03]) versus 2.53 [3.30]; p <0.01), whereas the percentage of scores above cutoff in both groups was similar. Four of 7 items were more often reported as present by subjects with ID: ""tense or wound up feelings,"" ""frightened feelings,"" ""worrying thoughts,"" and ""sudden feelings of panic."" Conclusions: Older people with ID report more symptoms of anxiety than older people with normal intelligence. Tense feelings and worrying especially need more attention, because more than one-half of all older people with ID reported such symptoms."
24012082,Neurocognition in early-onset schizophrenia,Sophia Frangou,"Cognitive impairment is recognized as a central feature of schizophrenia. Early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) represents a more severe variant of the disorder associated with onset in childhood or adolescence. Examination of the cognitive abnormalities of EOS offers the opportunity to explore how disease-related mechanisms may affect facets of cognitive development. This article summarizes and synthesizes available data with regards to the profile of cognitive impairments in EOS, their severity, and their evolution over the course of the disorder."
24011851,Heartless and cunning? Intelligence in adolescents with antisocial behavior and psychopathic traits,Jennifer L Allen,"Clinical theory predicts that individuals high in psychopathic traits possess average or above average intelligence; however findings in adult and child samples have been mixed. The present study aimed to investigate (1) the relationship between verbal and nonverbal intelligence and the three dimensions of psychopathy (callous-unemotional (CU) traits, narcissism, impulsivity); and (2) whether these dimensions moderate the association between verbal and nonverbal intelligence and the severity of antisocial behavior. Participants were 361 adolescents aged 9-18 years (68% boys) and their parents, drawn from four samples with different levels of risk for antisocial behavior. Families were disadvantaged and 25% were from an ethnic minority. Verbal intelligence was unrelated to parent-reported CU traits, narcissism or impulsivity after controlling for gender, sociodemographic disadvantage, sample, antisocial behavior and hyperactivity. Narcissism, but not CU traits or impulsivity, was significantly related to lower nonverbal IQ. None of the three psychopathic trait dimensions moderated the relationship between verbal or nonverbal IQ and antisocial behavior. CU traits, narcissism, hyperactivity and inclusion in the very high or high risk samples were significantly related to more severe antisocial behavior. Results contradict the widely held view that psychopathic traits are associated with better than average verbal or nonverbal intelligence."
24011494,"Relationship between adverse early experiences, stressors, psychosocial resources and wellbeing",Sharon Mc Elroy,"The study examined a diathesis stress model of the relationship between adverse child experiences (ACEs), stressors and psychosocial resources to explore their relationship with wellbeing. A cross sectional study was conducted across two mental health and addiction treatment centers. 176 individuals were interviewed using a demographics form, SCID-DSM-IV(First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &Williams, 2002), Child Trauma Questionnaire (Bernstein & Fink, 1998), NEO-Five Factor Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992), Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (Petrides, 2009), The Coping, Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) (Endler & Parker, 1990), Recent Life Events Questionnaire (Department of Health, 1985) and perceived social support from family, friends and religion. Multiple, regressions and correlations were used to analyze the data. All early experiences, except physical, abuse and death of a parent in childhood, were significantly correlated with increased number of, stressors and lower wellbeing scores. This is possibly because of sample specific issues. Number of stressors partially mediated the relationship between ACEs and wellbeing. Increased number of ACEs was related to higher neuroticism and emotion-focused coping and lower conscientiousness, agreeableness, trait emotional intelligence and task coping scores. These resources were significantly related to increased stressors and lower wellbeing. Distraction and emotion coping significantly moderated the relationship between number of stressors and wellbeing. These findings support the diathesis stress model and indicate that there are significant relationships between ACEs, psychosocial, resources, stressors and wellbeing. Recommendations to improve wellbeing are discussed."
24011399,Neurocognitive and psychological profiles of adult patients with epilepsy in Hong Kong,Venus Tang,"Cognitive deficits and psychological impairments are often associated with seizures. In order to describe the neuropsychological profiles of adult patients with epilepsy (PWEs) in Hong Kong China, a total of 186 PWEs were recruited with 102 being drug-responsive and 84 being drug-resistant. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and epilepsy-specific quality of life (QOL) were measured. Cognitive assessments consisted of intelligence, memory, verbal and visual abilities, and executive function. Neurocognitive impairments were prevalent among PWEs, and patients with drug-resistant epilepsy had significantly more impaired psychological and cognitive profiles. Thirty-nine percent and 30% of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy reported moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depression, respectively, versus 16% and 7% of patients with drug-responsive epilepsy. The most commonly occurring cognitive deficit was memory. Thirty-five percent to 47% of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and 26% to 35% of patients with drug-responsive epilepsy were compromised in verbal recall memory. Our findings also suggested significant correlations between psychological well-being and cognitive performance. Patients who reported more psychological symptoms tended to perform worse in neurocognitive tests. Identification and management of neuropsychological difficulties in PWEs are important and should be included in primary epilepsy care."
24011104,Effects of an emotional intelligence intervention on aggression and empathy among adolescents,Ruth Castillo,"The aim of this study was to explore the effects of a two-year intervention grounded in the ability model of emotional intelligence (EI) on aggression and empathy among adolescents. Eight Spanish public schools volunteered to participate in the research. A total of 590 adolescents (46% boys) were randomly assigned to either the EI training group or control group conditions. Students in the EI training group reported lower levels of physical/verbal aggression, anger, hostility, personal distress and fantasy compared to students in the control group. Additionally, the EI program was particularly effective for males' empathic abilities. These findings confirm the effectiveness of social and emotional learning interventions in Spanish academic contexts and extend the literature of gender-related differences during adolescence. Study limitations and future research directions are also considered."
24009549,"Deceptively simple … The ""deception-general"" ability and the need to put the liar under the spotlight",Gordon R T Wright,"This Focused Review expands upon our original paper (You can't kid a kidder"": Interaction between production and detection of deception in an interactive deception task. Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 6:87). In that paper we introduced a new socially interactive, laboratory-based task, the Deceptive Interaction Task (DeceIT), and used it to measure individuals' ability to lie, their ability to detect the lies of others, and potential individual difference measures contributing to these abilities. We showed that the two skills were correlated; better liars made better lie detectors (a ""deception general"" ability) and this ability seemed to be independent of cognitive (IQ) and emotional (EQ) intelligence. Here, following the Focused Review format, we outline the method and results of the original paper and comment more on the value of lab-based experimental studies of deception, which have attracted criticism in recent years. While acknowledging that experimental paradigms may fail to recreate the full complexity and potential seriousness of real-world deceptive behavior, we suggest that lab-based deception paradigms can offer valuable insight into ecologically-valid deceptive behavior. The use of the DeceIT procedure enabled deception to be studied in an interactive setting, with motivated participants, and importantly allowed the study of both the liar and the lie detector within the same deceptive interaction. It is our thesis that by addressing deception more holistically-by bringing the liar into the ""spotlight"" which is typically trained exclusively on the lie detector-we may further enhance our understanding of deception."
24009421,Occlusal traits in developmental dyslexia: a preliminary study,Letizia Perillo,"Aim: The objective of the study reported here was to assess the orthodontic features in children affected by developmental dyslexia (DD). Patients and methods: A total of 28 children affected by DD (22 boys, six girls; mean age: 9.78 ± 1.69 years) were compared with 51 healthy children (38 boys, 13 girls; mean age 9.41 ± 1.48; range 7-10 years). Reading and writing skills were evaluated along with orthodontic features. Results: The DD and control groups were not significantly different in terms of total intelligence quotient (P = 0.441) and writing skills (P = 0.805 and P = 0.240, respectively), whereas significant differences were observed between the DD group and control group in both word reading (2.018 ± 1.714 vs 0.917 ± 0.563; P = 0.000) and non-word reading (2.537 ± 1.543 vs 0.862 ± 0.244; P = 0.000). Moreover, for many orthodontic features, there was no significant difference between the two groups; only in prevalence of diastemas (57.14%, P = 0.006), midline diastemas (46.42%, P = 0.007), overbite > 4 mm (71.42%, P = 0.006) and overjet > 4 mm (53.57%, P = 0.001), was there a statistically significant difference. According to univariate logistic regression analysis, the presence of diastemas (odds ratio [OR] 4.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61-11.65), midline diastemas (OR 4.68; 95% CI 1.61-13.43), an overbite >4 mm (OR 1.75; 95% CI 0.64-4.71), or an overjet >4 mm (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.06-7.20) seems to play a role in the relationship between occlusal abnormalities and DD in children. Conclusion: Children with DD tend to present with altered dental features, particularly in the area of the incisors, suggesting that a persistently different tongue kinematic profile may thus affect both the developmental variability of the tongue and lip and the occlusion."
24007052,Dual-band infrared remote sensing system with combined long-wave infrared imaging and mid-wave infrared spectral analysis,Zheng Fang,"We present a new optical system for infrared (IR) image-spectrum integration remote sensing. The purpose to develop this instrument is to find the key spectral characteristics of typical hot target and to explore a new intelligence fusion method for the recognition. When mounted on a two-dimensional rotation stage, it can track the suspected target by image processing, and then get its spectrum to do recognition. It is a dual-band system with long-wave infrared (LWIR) imaging and mid-wave infrared (MWIR) spectrum. An IR dichroic beamsplitter is used to divide wideband incident infrared into LWIR and MWIR. Compared to traditional infrared combined imaging and spectral-analysis instruments, it yields higher sensitivity for measuring the IR spectrum. The sensors for imaging and spectrum detection are separate, so high spatial resolution, frame rate, and spectrum resolution can all be obtained simultaneously."
24006326,Temporal and non-temporal processes in the elderly,Leah Fostick,"Background: The present study examined whether the reported age-related decline in auditory temporal resolution is specific to the temporal domain or rather reflects a general decline in auditory perception, including the stimulus intensity domain. Methods: The performance of 89 healthy participants aged between 21 and 82 years with normal hearing was tested on a variety of psychophysical tasks, where discrimination was based either on the temporal or on the intensity domains. Stimulus levels for all tasks were 40 dB SL (corrected for threshold). Participants were also tested on two cognitive tasks: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition, matrices and digit span. Results: Findings indicate that age was significantly negatively correlated with performance on three of the temporal resolution tasks, namely, dichotic temporal-order judgment, spectral temporal-order judgment, and gap detection, but not on the intensity discrimination task, thus emphasizing the specificity of the age-related decline to the auditory temporal domain. Conclusions: The overall results suggest that age-related changes in auditory perception are specific to the temporal domain, even when controlling for hearing sensitivity and cognitive ability, and are not reflected in other aspects of non-temporal perception, such as intensity discrimination."
24006023,Changing patterns of migration in Latin America: how can research develop intelligence for public health?,Baltica Cabieses,"Migration patterns in Latin America have changed significantly in recent decades, particularly since the onset of global recession in 2007. These recent economic changes have highlighted and exacerbated the weakness of evidence from Latin America regarding migration-a crucial determinant of health. Migration patterns are constantly evolving in Latin America, but research on migration has not developed at the same speed. This article focuses on the need for better understanding of the living conditions and health of migrant populations in Latin America within the context of the recent global recession. The authors explain how new data on migrant well-being could be obtained through improved evidence from censuses and ongoing research surveys to 1) better inform policy-makers about the needs of migrant populations in Latin America and 2) help determine better ways of reaching undocumented immigrants. Longitudinal studies on immigrants in Latin America are essential for generating a better representation of migrant living conditions and health needs during the initial stages of immigration and over time. To help meet this need, the authors support the promotion of sustainable sources of data and evidence on the complex relationship between migration and health."
24003829,Life outcomes influenced by war-related experiences during the Gulf crisis,Fawzyiah Hadi,"This study examined the life outcomes of children exposed to the Gulf crisis in 1990-1991. We expected war-trauma exposure and psychological distress symptoms to predict poorer educational and occupational outcomes. Participants were 151 Kuwaiti citizens who were assessed during childhood (in 1993; M age = 10.6 years), and who were reassessed 10 years later in young adulthood (in 2003; M age = 21.2 years). Participants completed measures of intelligence, war-trauma exposure, posttraumatic stress symptoms, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, intervening life events, and life outcomes. Results indicated that war-trauma exposure negatively impacted children's educational and occupational outcomes as young adults. Boys with higher levels of war-trauma exposure were less likely to attend University. Posttraumatic stress and anxiety symptoms also predicted poorer educational and occupational outcomes. However, this relationship was not significant when we accounted for children's intelligence. Depressive symptoms were not predictive of children's educational or occupational outcomes. Results suggest that war-trauma exposure may have life-altering effects on children. Tailored, early interventions are needed for children exposed to war traumas."
24003589,Individual ambidexterity: exploring and exploiting in dynamic contexts,Darren Good,"Previous research regarding the role of individuals within the organizational ambidexterity construct has primarily focused on behavioral characteristics of managers. Drawing from the organizational, psychological, and neuroscience literatures, this study develops and tests hypotheses concerning the formative construct of Individual Ambidexterity (IA), the cognitive abilities necessary to balance efforts of exploration and exploitation. In an initial criterion-related predictive validity laboratory study, 181 undergraduate students completed successive trials in a computer-simulated, real-time dynamic microworld context. Findings explained unique variance beyond measures of general intelligence on the total score of task adaptive performance. The results indicate a novel combination of abilities that may further understanding of how individual abilities contribute to the ambidexterity literature."
24002887,Childhood socioeconomic status amplifies genetic effects on adult intelligence,Timothy C Bates,"Studies of intelligence in children reveal significantly higher heritability among groups with high socioeconomic status (SES) than among groups with low SES. These interaction effects, however, have not been examined in adults, when between-families environmental effects are reduced. Using 1,702 adult twins (aged 24-84) for whom intelligence assessment data were available, we tested for interactions between childhood SES and genetic effects, between-families environmental effects, and unique environmental effects. Higher SES was associated with higher mean intelligence scores. Moreover, the magnitude of genetic influences on intelligence was proportional to SES. By contrast, environmental influences were constant. These results suggest that rather than setting lower and upper bounds on intelligence, genes multiply environmental inputs that support intellectual growth. This mechanism implies that increasing SES may raise average intelligence but also magnifies individual differences in intelligence."
24002885,Literacy and numeracy are more heritable than intelligence in primary school,Yulia Kovas,"Because literacy and numeracy are the focus of teaching in schools, whereas general cognitive ability (g, intelligence) is not, it would be reasonable to expect that literacy and numeracy are less heritable than g. Here, we directly compare heritabilities of multiple measures of literacy, numeracy, and g in a United Kingdom sample of 7,500 pairs of twins assessed longitudinally at ages 7, 9, and 12. We show that differences between children are significantly and substantially more heritable for literacy and numeracy than for g at ages 7 and 9, but not 12. We suggest that the reason for this counterintuitive result is that universal education in the early school years reduces environmental disparities so that individual differences that remain are to a greater extent due to genetic differences. In contrast, the heritability of g increases during development as individuals select and create their own environments correlated with their genetic propensities."
24002709,Overview of Taiwan's indigenous ethnopharmacology in the perspective of traditional knowledge protection,Jing-jing Guo,"Ethnopharmacology, the study of ethnic use of drugs, opens up the crucial gateway to understanding and promoting traditional medicine in the new age. Taiwan is a unique region where traditional medicine and herbal therapeutics have been benefiting its people of multiple races for centuries. This article overviews Taiwan's indigenous traditional medicine and the emerging status of ethnopharmacology study, and outlines the global scenario of the inheritance and development of traditional medicine. In such a scope of knowledge protection, this article particularly highlights the challenges with bioprospecting and biopiracy, and summarizes the current measures for protection of traditional knowledge in Taiwan. Finally, based upon these analyses, we propose rational strategies for promoting Taiwan's ethnopharmacology, from multiple angles of resource, economy, policy and law. We conclude that four measures, namely (1) protecting the natural environment of biodiversity, (2) avoiding unnecessary conflicts caused by bioprospecting and biopiracy, (3) strengthening the international collaboration, and (4) upgrading the legal system of traditional intelligence, would be the right paths for Taiwan to protect its invaluable heritage of traditional medicine and the knowledge of ethnopharmacology therein."
24001924,An improved method of early diagnosis of smoking-induced respiratory changes using machine learning algorithms,Jorge L M Amaral,"The purpose of this study was to develop an automatic classifier to increase the accuracy of the forced oscillation technique (FOT) for diagnosing early respiratory abnormalities in smoking patients. The data consisted of FOT parameters obtained from 56 volunteers, 28 healthy and 28 smokers with low tobacco consumption. Many supervised learning techniques were investigated, including logistic linear classifiers, k nearest neighbor (KNN), neural networks and support vector machines (SVM). To evaluate performance, the ROC curve of the most accurate parameter was established as baseline. To determine the best input features and classifier parameters, we used genetic algorithms and a 10-fold cross-validation using the average area under the ROC curve (AUC). In the first experiment, the original FOT parameters were used as input. We observed a significant improvement in accuracy (KNN=0.89 and SVM=0.87) compared with the baseline (0.77). The second experiment performed a feature selection on the original FOT parameters. This selection did not cause any significant improvement in accuracy, but it was useful in identifying more adequate FOT parameters. In the third experiment, we performed a feature selection on the cross products of the FOT parameters. This selection resulted in a further increase in AUC (KNN=SVM=0.91), which allows for high diagnostic accuracy. In conclusion, machine learning classifiers can help identify early smoking-induced respiratory alterations. The use of FOT cross products and the search for the best features and classifier parameters can markedly improve the performance of machine learning classifiers."
24001586,A multidimensional assessment of social cognition in psychometrically defined schizotypy,Sean C Morrison,"Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit impairments in multiple social cognitive domains. There is evidence that these impairments may be trait-related vulnerability markers for schizophrenia. However, the literature focusing on individuals vulnerable to developing schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, referred to as schizotypy, has produced inconsistent findings. This study's primary aim was to provide a more comprehensive understanding of social cognitive functioning within schizotypy than previous studies by employing a broad array of measures to assess multiple social cognitive domains, and examine how these domains relate to specific schizotypy traits (i.e., positive, negative, and disorganized) and Quality of Life (QOL). Facial emotion recognition, Theory of Mind (ToM), and aspects of emotional intelligence related to regulating one's own emotions (emotion management) and other's emotions (social management) were measured. Individuals with psychometrically defined schizotypy (n=36) and controls (n=26) were examined. The schizotypy group performed significantly worse than controls on facial emotion recognition, ToM, and emotion management, but not social management. Generally speaking, poorer social cognition performance was not a function of specific schizotypy traits. However, negative traits were associated with poorer facial emotion recognition, and disorganized traits were associated with better social management. Facial emotion recognition was associated with QOL in the schizotypy group."
24001466,Mechanism of injury and microbiological flora of the geographical location are essential for the prognosis in soldiers with serious warfare injuries,Mik Wetterslev,"Introduction: Denmark has been engaged in the Afghanistan war and as a result, Rigshospitalet has received a number of multi-traumatized Danish soldiers. Lesions sustained in armed conflict differ from their civilian counterparts and knowledge of the pathophysiology related to these types of lesions is essential when engaging in the intensive care of these patients. Material and methods: The study was conducted as a retrospective survey of Danish soldiers evacuated from Afghanistan to the Intensive Care Unit at Rigshospitalet in the 2002-2012 period. The following data were recorded: age, gender, hospitalization (days), mortality, organ involvement, respiratory therapy, dialysis, circulatory supportive care, antibiotic treatment and bacteriology. Furthermore, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation, Simplified Acute Physiology Score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were calculated. Results: A total of twenty patients were identified and included in the study. All patients had sustained serious blast injuries as a result of explosion. Primarily the central nervous system, respiratory, musculoskeletal and abdominal systems were affected by the explosions. Eighteen patients survived to discharge and two patients died. Discussion: Explosion was the most frequent cause of injury in all cases and caused damage to several organ systems. Infections after combat injuries are a major problem because of the different microbiological profile. Conclusion: The use of explosives has been and remains a substantial part of warfare, and this review has showed us that the knowledge of the mechanism of injury is indeed essential, and that intelligence on the microbiological flora of the geographical location of the conflict is essential. Funding: not relevant. Trial registration: not relevant."
23999613,"Memristor, Hodgkin-Huxley, and edge of chaos",Leon Chua,"From a pedagogical point of view, the memristor is defined in this tutorial as any 2-terminal device obeying a state-dependent Ohm's law. This tutorial also shows that from an experimental point of view, the memristor can be defined as any 2-terminal device that exhibits the fingerprints of 'pinched' hysteresis loops in the v-i plane. It also shows that memristors endowed with a continuum of equilibrium states can be used as non-volatile analog memories. This tutorial shows that memristors span a much broader vista of complex phenomena and potential applications in many fields, including neurobiology. In particular, this tutorial presents toy memristors that can mimic the classic habituation and LTP learning phenomena. It also shows that sodium and potassium ion-channel memristors are the key to generating the action potential in the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, and that they are the key to resolving several unresolved anomalies associated with the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. This tutorial ends with an amazing new result derived from the new principle of local activity, which uncovers a minuscule life-enabling 'Goldilocks zone', dubbed the edge of chaos, where complex phenomena, including creativity and intelligence, may emerge. From an information processing perspective, this tutorial shows that synapses are locally-passive memristors, and that neurons are made of locally-active memristors."
23999528,Exome sequencing in multiplex autism families suggests a major role for heterozygous truncating mutations,C Toma,"Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, the aetiology of which remains mainly unknown. Family and twin studies provide strong evidence that genetic factors have a major role in the aetiology of this disease. Recently, whole exome sequencing (WES) efforts have focused mainly on rare de novo variants in singleton families. Although these studies have provided pioneering insights, de novo variants probably explain only a small proportion of the autism risk variance. In this study, we performed exome sequencing of 10 autism multiplex families with the aim of investigating the role of rare variants that are coinherited in the affected sibs. The pool of variants selected in our study is enriched with genes involved in neuronal functions or previously reported in psychiatric disorders, as shown by Gene Ontology analysis and by browsing the Neurocarta database. Our data suggest that rare truncating heterozygous variants have a predominant role in the aetiology of autism. Using a multiple linear regression model, we found that the burden of truncating mutations correlates with a lower non-verbal intelligence quotient (NVIQ). Also, the number of truncating mutations that were transmitted to the affected sibs was significantly higher (twofold) than those not transmitted. Protein-protein interaction analysis performed with our list of mutated genes revealed that the postsynaptic YWHAZ is the most interconnected node of the network. Among the genes found disrupted in our study, there is evidence suggesting that YWHAZ and also the X-linked DRP2 may be considered as novel autism candidate genes."
23999476,Cognitive function in schizophrenia: insights from intelligence research,Eileen M Joyce,"Schizophrenia is characterised by generalised cognitive impairment that is both a risk factor and a predictor of outcome. Recent research into human intelligence supports the view that, in schizophrenia, poor performance on disparate cognitive tasks can be explained by dysfunction of a frontoparietal neural network thought to support fluid intelligence."
23999176,Assessing EEG sleep spindle propagation. Part 1: theory and proposed methodology,Christian O'Reilly,"Background: A convergence of studies has revealed sleep spindles to be associated with sleep-related cognitive processing and even with fundamental waking state capacities such as intelligence. However, some spindle characteristics, such as propagation direction and delay, may play a decisive role but are only infrequently investigated because of technical complexities. New method: A new methodology for assessing sleep spindle propagation over the human scalp using noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) is described. This approach is based on the alignment of time-frequency representations of spindle activity across recording channels. Results: This first of a two-part series concentrates on framing theoretical considerations related to EEG spindle propagation and on detailing the methodology. A short example application is provided that illustrates the repeatability of results obtained with the new propagation measure in a sample of 32 night recordings. A more comprehensive experimental investigation is presented in part two of the series. Comparison with existing method(s): Compared to existing methods, this approach is particularly well adapted for studying the propagation of sleep spindles because it estimates time delays rather than phase synchrony and it computes propagation properties for every individual spindle with windows adjusted to the specific spindle duration. Conclusions: The proposed methodology is effective in tracking the propagation of spindles across the scalp and may thus help in elucidating the temporal aspects of sleep spindle dynamics, as well as other transient EEG and MEG events. A software implementation (the Spyndle Python package) is provided as open source software."
23998426,Clever glia,Sonia Spitzer,"Twenty years ago glial cells were shown to contribute to neuronal information processing, instead of merely supporting neuronal function, thus challenging the century old neuron doctrine. Due to the lack of appropriate experimental models, however, determining the role of glia in higher brain function and disease has been hampered. In a recent paper, Han and colleagues transplanted human glial progenitor cells into mice; not only does this study pave the way for generations of excellent models to study the physiology and pathophysiology of human glial cells, especially in the age of induced pluripotent stem cells, but more importantly it further challenges the neuron doctrine, since the human-glia transplanted mice turned into better learners. So, are glial cells the ones we owe our intelligence to after all?"
23998407,Incremental reduction in the incidence of stroke in children supported with the Berlin EXCOR ventricular assist device,Jonathan W Byrnes,"Background: Cerebrovascular events (CVEs) are common among children supported with the Berlin EXCOR (Berlin Heart GmbH, Berlin, Germany) ventricular assist device (VAD). Given the high incidence of CVEs associated with this device, we sought to describe our institutional experience in incrementally reducing CVEs in children supported with the Berlin EXCOR VAD. Methods: We collected pertinent data on 39 consecutive patients who underwent Berlin EXCOR VAD implantation at a single center. Frequency of CVEs was described in risk per implantation, per day, and in reference to the time of therapeutic anticoagulation. Risk factors were analyzed for association with CVEs. Results: Of the initial 39 Berlin EXCOR VAD implantations, 16 CVEs occurred in 12 patients. The incidence of CVEs decreased with institutional experience per patient (R(2) = 0.6909, p = 0.007) and per patient-day (R(2) = 0.8051, p = 0.002). CVEs occurred more frequently before therapeutic anticoagulation targets were achieved (4.1%/day) compared with after therapeutic anticoagulation targets were achieved (0.9%/day; p = 0.044). Conclusions: Incidence of CVEs decreased with institutional experience. The risk of CVE is highest in the immediate postoperative period before therapeutic anticoagulation is achieved. Further studies are warranted in pediatric patients supported with the Berlin EXCOR VAD to confirm our findings in a larger cohort."
23997246,"On Vaccination & Chiropractic: when ideology, history, perception, politics and jurisprudence collide",Brian Gleberzon,"The Palmers espoused anti-vaccination opinions in the early part of the 20(th) century, rejecting the germ theory of disease in favor of a worldview that a subluxation-free spine, achieved by spinal adjustments, would result in an unfettered innate intelligence; this, along with other healthful lifestyle choices, would allow a person to thwart disease by marshaling the body's natural recuperative abilities. Some chiropractors continue to staunchly champion the Palmer postulates, while others do not. At the national level, advocacy organizations publish conflicting position statements. We explore how this divisiveness has impacted chiropractic ideology, perceptions among students and practitioners, politics and issues of jurisprudence as reflected by the evolution of a standard of chiropractic practice in at least one Canadian province (Ontario). We opine that the chiropractic profession should champion a health promotion and disease prevention approach to vaccination, which would allow it to align itself with the broader healthcare community while not abandoning its traditional tenets."
23994831,Facial emotion recognition in childhood: the effects of febrile seizures in the developing brain,Gaetano Cantalupo,"It has been documented that anteromedial temporal lobe dysfunction can cause impairment in emotional intelligence. In particular, medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is associated with disorders in emotion recognition from facial expressions. About one-third of patients with MTLE experienced febrile seizures (FSs) during childhood. In the present study, we investigated facial emotion recognition ability in a group of 38 school-aged children with antecedent FSs and in an age- and sex-matched control group. Children with abnormal general visuoperceptual abilities were excluded. Children with FSs showed lower recognition scores versus controls in both matching (28.64 vs 33.47; p<.0001) and labeling (21.25 vs 23.03; p=.001) facial emotions. Our findings support the hypothesis that FSs can be associated during childhood with a dysfunction within the neural network subserving the processing of facial expressions of the basic emotions."
23994830,Cognitive correlates of interictal epileptiform discharges in adult patients with epilepsy in China,Yudan Lv,"Objective: Learning difficulties or cognitive impairment has been observed in many patients with epilepsy. Evidence from neurophysiologic and functional neuroimaging suggests that epileptic seizures and/or epileptiform activity can be the dominant factors inhibiting specific brain areas. However, most previous studies were focused on cognitive performance in children. In this study, we analyzed a new cohort of adult patients with frequent interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Methods: Data from 67 adult patients with epilepsy were reviewed. Electroencephalography (EEG)-video recording and cognitive testing were performed, and the IED index was estimated as a percentage assigned to one of four categories (<1%, 1-10%, 10-50%, and >50%) during either wakefulness or sleep. Correlations of cognitive test results and clinical characteristics of IED categories were analyzed. The effects of the frequency, duration, location, and sleep-wake cycles of IEDs on cognition (intelligence and memory capacity) were analyzed. Results: Patients with an IED index >10% showed impaired performance on the Chinese Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-RC) and the Chinese Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS). This effect was detected independently from other IED frequencies and other IED-related variables, such as duration, distribution, and location. The impact of waking or sleeping IEDs was of equal importance in contributing to impaired WAIS-RC and WMS performance. Conclusion: An IED frequency of more than 10% in both waking and sleeping EEGs is associated with impaired cognitive performance in adult patients. However, whether patients with a high IED frequency but low seizure frequency will benefit from antiepileptic treatment should be examined in future studies."
23993429,Clinical and metabolic findings in patients with methionine adenosyltransferase I/III deficiency detected by newborn screening,María L Couce,"Persistent hypermethioninemia due to mutations in the MAT1A gene is often found during newborn screening (NBS) for homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency, however, outcomes and optimal management for these patients are not well established. We carried out a multicenter study of MAT I/III-deficient patients detected by NBS in four of the Spanish regional NBS programs. Data evaluated during NBS and follow-up for 18 patients included methionine and total homocysteine levels, clinical presentation parameters, genotypes, and development quotients. The birth prevalence was 1:1:22,874. At detection 16 of the 18 patients exhibited elevations of plasma methionine above 60 μmol/L (mean 99.9 ± 38 μmol/L) and the mean value in confirmation tests was 301 μmol/L (91-899) μmol/L. All patients were asymptomatic. In four patients with more markedly elevated plasma methionines (>450 μmol/L) total homocysteine values were slightly elevated (about 20 μmol/L). The average follow-up period was 3 years 7 months (range: 2-123 months). Most patients (83%) were heterozygous for the autosomal dominant Arg264His mutation and, with one exception, presented relatively low circulating methionine concentrations (<400 μM). Additional mutations identified in patients with mean confirmatory plasma methionines above 400 μM were Arg199Cys, Leu355Arg, and a novel mutation, Thr288Ala. During continued follow-up, the patients have been asymptomatic, and, to date, no therapeutic interventions have been utilized. Therefore, the currently available evidence shows that hypermethioninemia due to heterozygous MAT1A mutations such as Arg264His is a mild condition for which no treatment is necessary."
23993136,Prevalence of premorbid personality disorder and its clinical correlates in patients with delusional disorder,Enrique de Portugal,"The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of premorbid Personality Disorder (PD) and its relationship with clinical correlates in patients with Delusional Disorder (DD). Eighty-six outpatients with DD whose diagnoses were confirmed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I (SCID-I) Disorders (psychosis module) were evaluated for premorbid PD utilizing the Standardized Assessment of Personality (SAP). Psychopathology was assessed using Module B of SCID-I and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS); psychosocial functioning was evaluated with the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. Premorbid intelligence was assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition, vocabulary subtest. A sociodemographic-clinical questionnaire was completed. Sixty-four percent of the patients had at least one premorbid PD, the most common being paranoid PD (38.4%), followed by schizoid PD (12.8%). The presence of at least one premorbid PD was significantly associated with higher scores for psychopathology, in particular, on the affective dimension of DD symptoms. However, the presence of premorbid PD was not associated with psychosocial functioning. Each of the premorbid PD was associated with different psychopathological profiles. Premorbid PD is a relevant phenomenon in DD, given its high prevalence and comorbidity, its influence on clinical correlates and its potential ability to predict specific sub-syndromes."
23992789,"Intellectual functioning in children with epilepsy: frontal lobe epilepsy, childhood absence epilepsy and benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes",Ana Filipa Lopes,"Purpose: The purpose of our study is to describe intellectual functioning in three common childhood epilepsy syndromes - frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) and benign epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BECTS). And also to determine the influence of epilepsy related variables, type of epilepsy, age at epilepsy onset, duration and frequency of epilepsy, and treatment on the scores. Methods: Intellectual functioning was examined in a group of 90 children with epilepsy (30 FLE, 30 CAE, 30 BECTS), aged 6-15 years, and compared with a control group (30). All subjects obtained a Full Scale IQ ≥ 70 and they were receiving no more than two antiepileptic medications. Participants completed the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Third Edition. The impact of epilepsy related variables (type of epilepsy, age at epilepsy onset, duration of epilepsy, seizure frequency and anti-epileptic drugs) on intellectual functioning was examined. Results: Children with FLE scored significantly worse than controls on WISC-III Verbal IQ, Full Scale IQ and Processing Speed Index. There was a trend for children with FLE to have lower intelligence scores than CAE and BECTS groups. Linear regression analysis showed no effect for age at onset, frequency of seizures and treatment. Type of epilepsy and duration of epilepsy were the best indicators of intellectual functioning. Conclusion: It is crucial that children with FLE and those with a longer active duration of epilepsy are closely monitored to allow the early identification and evaluation of cognitive problems, in order to establish adequate and timely school intervention plans."
30189494,Examining IQ among a clinical sample of preschool children with autism spectrum disorder over time,M Barry,"Background: The cognitive functioning of children who received a diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) during the preschool years was assessed at the time of diagnosis (Time 1) and reassessed, on average, 3 years and 5 months later (Time 2). Method: A total of 50 children were assessed (76% male, n = 38); the group had an average age of 4 years 3 months at Time 1 and 7 years 8 months at Time 2. Results: There was a significant positive relationship (r = 0.791, p < 0.01) between the group's Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ)/Developmental Quotient (DQ) at Time 1 and at Time 2. Results indicated a significant increase in FSIQ/DQ over time for the total group and for both the High Functioning (IQ ⩾ 70) and Low Functioning (IQ < 70) groups. Of the total samples, 32% showed a clinically significant change in FSIQ/DQ of 15 points or more from Time 1 to Time 2. When age at Time 1 was included as a covariate, no significant difference was identified for change in FSIQ over time. The practical implications of the findings are discussed."
28360545,Psychiatric and Neurocognitive Evaluation Focused on Frontal Lobe Functions in Rolandic Epilepsy,Muhammed Ayaz,"Introduction: In this study, we aimed to assess the behavioral problems, psychiatric disorders and neurocognitive functions focusing on frontal lobe functions in children with rolandic epilepsy (RE) and compare them with a control group. Method: 31 children with RE, aged between 8 and 13,5 years were compared with a control group matched for age, sex and socioeconomic status. Behavioral problems were assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and psychiatric diagnoses were established by using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Present and Lifetime Version. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT) were applied in both groups of children. Result: The RE group presented more psychiatric disorders than the control group. Verbal and total IQ scores in the RE group were lower than in the control group. Although the groups did not differ from each other in WCST scores, children with RE displayed lower performance in SCWT. The RE group had a higher externalizing score and higher total scores in CBCL. Conclusion: It was concluded that RE did not affect basic frontal lobe functions significantly, had negative effects on attention and IQ performance and increased behavioral problems and psychiatric disorders."
26741057,Bifactor Modeling and the Estimation of Model-Based Reliability in the WAIS-IV,Gilles E Gignac,"Previous confirmatory factor analytic research that has examined the factor structure of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) has endorsed either higher order models or oblique factor models that tend to amalgamate both general factor and index factor sources of systematic variance. An alternative model that has not yet been examined for the WAIS-IV is the bifactor model. Bifactor models allow all subtests to load onto both the general factor and their respective index factor directly. Bifactor models are also particularly amenable to the estimation of model-based reliabilities for both global composite scores (ω h ) and subscale/index scores (ω s ). Based on the WAIS-IV normative sample correlation matrices, a bifactor model that did not include any index factor cross loadings or correlated residuals was found to be better fitting than the conventional higher order and oblique factor models. Although the ω h estimate associated with the full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) scores was respectably high (.86), the ω s estimates associated with the WAIS-IV index scores were very low (.13 to .47). The results are interpreted in the context of the benefits of a bifactor modeling approach. Additionally, in light of the very low levels of unique internal consistency reliabilities associated with the index scores, it is contended that clinical index score interpretations are probably not justifiable."
26173215,From the Revolution to Embodiment: 25 Years of Cognitive Psychology,Arthur M Glenberg,"In 1988, the cognitive revolution had become institutionalized: Cognition was the manipulation of abstract symbols by rules. But, much like institutionalized political parties, some of the ideas were becoming stale. Where was action? Where was the self? How could cognition be smoothly integrated with emotions, with social psychology, with development, with clinical analyses? Around that time, thinkers in linguistics, philosophy, artificial intelligence, biology, and psychology were formulating the idea that just as overt behavior depends on the specifics of the body in action, so might cognition depend on the body. Here we characterize (some would say caricature) the strengths and weaknesses of cognitive psychology of that era, and then we describe what has come to be called embodied cognition: how cognition arises through the dynamic interplay of brain controlling bodily action controlling perception, which changes the brain. We focus on the importance of action and how action shapes perception, the self, and language. Having the body in action as a central consideration for theories of cognition promises, we believe, to help unify psychology."
25638827,The origin of bounded rationality and intelligence,Andrew W Lo,"Rational economic behavior in which individuals maximize their own self-interest is only one of many possible types of behavior that arise from natural selection. Given an initial population of individuals, each assigned a purely arbitrary behavior with respect to a binary choice problem, and assuming that offspring behave identically to their parents, only those behaviors linked to reproductive success will survive, and less successful behaviors will disappear exponentially fast. This framework yields a single evolutionary explanation for the origin of several behaviors that have been observed in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, including risk-sensitive foraging, risk aversion, loss aversion, probability matching, randomization, and diversification. The key to understanding which types of behavior are more likely to survive is how behavior affects reproductive success in a given population's environment. From this perspective, intelligence is naturally defined as behavior that increases the likelihood of reproductive success, and bounds on rationality are determined by physiological and environmental constraints."
25379250,Explaining Differential Reporting of Victimization between Parents and Children: A Consideration of Social Biases,Sufna Gheyara John,"Studies have shown that children and parents provide different reports of children's victimization, with children often reporting more victimization. However, the reason for this differential reporting is unclear. This study explored two types of social biases (emotion recognition and perceived impairment) in parents and children as possible reasons underlying differential reporting. Six- to 10-year-old children and one of their parents were tested in a lab. Testing included subjective measures of parent alexithymic traits, child perceived impairment from victimization, and child- and parent-reported frequency of children's peer victimization and internalizing and externalizing difficulties. Parents and children also completed an objective measure of emotion recognition. Both types of social bias significantly predicted reports of children's peer victimization frequency as well as internalizing and externalizing difficulties, as rated by parents and children. Moreover, child perceived impairment bias, rather than parent emotion bias, best predicted differential reporting of peer victimization. Finally, a significant interaction demonstrated that the influence of child perceived impairment bias on differential reporting was most salient in the presence of parent emotion bias. This underscores the importance of expanding interventions for victimized youth to include the restructuring of social biases."
25362821,"Breastfeeding and its influence into the cognitive process of Spanish school-children (6 years old), measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale]",Juan Manuel Pérez Ruiz,"Some scientific evidence support that a better cognitive development during the school age is related with breastfeeding. In this study, the potential benefit of breastfeeding duration is evaluated, related to Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory and Processing Speed. A total of 103 children, first year of Primary School, six-year-old, (47 boys and 56 girls), were included from different schools in the province of Granada (Spain) at urban, semi-urban and rural areas. The global cognitive capability, as well as some specific intelligence domains which permit a more precise and deeper analysis of the cognitive processes, was evaluated through the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--version IV. The results prove an association, statistically signnificative, between the best values of IQ and the other four WISC-IV indexes and a longer breastfeeding. There is a highly significant (p = 0.000) association between the best scores and those children who were breastfed during 6 months, which validates our hypothesis. The advice of breastfeeding during at least the first six months of life should be reinforced to reduce learning difficulties."
23991351,"""Personality traits and heart disease in the Middle East"". Is there a link?",Gohar Jamil,"The significant role of psychosocial factors as a contributing factor to an increased risk of having a myocardial infarction has been extensively studied in the western world. This era of economic crises has seen an exponential rise in heart disease at a relatively earlier age. Whether these dynamics are equally associated, in the younger ethnically diverse population of UAE, which contributes to more than 50% of the population is not very well known. Objectives: No studies have examined the role of psychosocial variables and personality traits as a contributing factor to CAD in the UAE. The objective of this case controlled study was to explore relationships between demographics, socioeconomic status, personality types, stress-handling abilities, emotional intelligence, and cardiac risk factors. Methods: The participants of this case controlled study included 90 MI patients admitted to a govt hospital in UAE during the period of 2011-2012, which were matched to 90 healthy individual. A analysis of their personality types, emotional intelligence and stress handling skills was performed using specific questionnaires. Results: The results showed a significantly higher incidence of Type A personality in the MI group. In addition, these individuals were also much more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, and a history smoking, when compared to controls. Moreover a significant relationship between the presence of Type A personality and the presence of CAD was identified. Associations among variables were examined followed by analysis, discussion, and recommendation for prevention and treatment of CAD in UAE."
23991033,Small and dim target detection via lateral inhibition filtering and Artificial Bee colony based selective visual attention,Haibin Duan,"This paper proposed a novel bionic selective visual attention mechanism to quickly select regions that contain salient objects to reduce calculations. Firstly, lateral inhibition filtering, inspired by the limulus' ommateum, is applied to filter low-frequency noises. After the filtering operation, we use Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm based selective visual attention mechanism to obtain the interested object to carry through the following recognition operation. In order to eliminate the camera motion influence, this paper adopted ABC algorithm, a new optimization method inspired by swarm intelligence, to calculate the motion salience map to integrate with conventional visual attention. To prove the feasibility and effectiveness of our method, several experiments were conducted. First the filtering results of lateral inhibition filter were shown to illustrate its noise reducing effect, then we applied the ABC algorithm to obtain the motion features of the image sequence. The ABC algorithm is proved to be more robust and effective through the comparison between ABC algorithm and popular Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Except for the above results, we also compared the classic visual attention mechanism and our ABC algorithm based visual attention mechanism, and the experimental results of which further verified the effectiveness of our method."
23990235,Cognitive impairment after appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy for ventricular fibrillation,Katarzyna Hałas,"Background: Short periods of cerebral ischaemia during ventricular defibrillation testing may be associated with neuropsychological impairment. However, the impact of out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) converted by implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shock on cognitive functioning is unknown. Aim: To assess the impact of out-of-hospital VF converted by ICD shock on cognitive functioning. Methods: The study included 52 primary prevention ICD recipients. Patients with a history of stroke or other neurological impairment, previous head injury and individuals unable to see or speak to complete neuropsychological tests were not included.Initially, a Mini-Mental State Examination was performed in all patients and one patient with a result below 24 points was excluded from the study. The cognitive battery consisted of four tests (six measurements): 1) the Digit Span subtest of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised; 2) the Digit Symbol subtest of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised; 3) the Halstead-Reitan Trail-Making Test A and B; and 4) the Ruff Figural Fluency Test. Results: The mean time from ICD implantation to cognitive assessment was 26 months. During this period, 15 appropriate shocks for VF were observed in seven (14%) patients. The patients with appropriate ICD therapy were significantly worse in two out of the six neuropsychological measurements and had a significantly lower aggregate result. In multivariate linear regression analysis, defibrillation therapy was an independent factor of poor cognitive functioning, along with age and education. Conclusions: Short periods of out-of-hospital VF converted by ICD are associated with cognitive impairment in the recipients of primary prevention ICD."
23988759,A neuroimaging investigation of attribute framing and individual differences,Kevin B Murch,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the neural basis of framing effects. We tested the reflexive and reflective systems model of social cognition as it relates to framing. We also examined the relationships among frame susceptibility, intelligence and personality measures. Participants evaluated whether personal attributes applied to themselves from multiple perspectives and in positive and negative frames. Participants rated whether each statement was descriptive or not and endorsed positive frames more than negative frames. Individual differences on frame decisions enabled us to form high and low frame susceptibility groups. Endorsement of frame-consistent attributes was associated with personality factors, cognitive reflection and intelligence. Reflexive brain regions were associated with positive frames while reflective areas were associated with negative frames. Region of Interest analyses showed that frame-inconsistent responses were associated with increased activation within reflective cognitive control regions including the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsomedial PFC and left ventrolateral PFC. Frame-consistent responses were associated with increased activation in the right orbitofrontal cortex. These results demonstrate that individual differences in frame susceptibility influence personal attribute evaluations. Overall, this study clarifies the neural correlates of the reflective and reflexive systems of social cognition as applied to decisions about social attributions."
23987797,Cognitive and psychosocial function post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,Jessica Jackson,"Objectives: This study investigated the cognitive and psychosocial outcomes in childhood survivors of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Methods: Twenty-one children were assessed on standardized measures of cognitive and psychosocial functioning and compared with an unaffected sibling control group (n = 14). Parent and teacher reports were obtained to provide additional information. Results: The average full-scale intelligence quotient for the patient cohort was 81 (95% CI, 72-90), which was significantly lower than both the population average of 100 (P = .001) and the average for the unaffected sibling control group (99.2, P = .002). Fifty-six percent of school-aged children were receiving additional support at school, with the majority needing high levels of support. These children also experienced significant psychosocial difficulties. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with poorer cognitive outcomes, but age at transplantation, time to transplantation, type of conditioning, and presence of mixed chimerism were not. Ten (48%) of 21 children had evidence of neurologic involvement at diagnosis, but surprisingly, this was not significantly associated with adverse neurologic outcomes, and some children who did not have any apparent neurologic involvement at diagnosis had severe learning difficulties at follow-up. Conclusions: In summary, childhood survivors of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis are at risk of long-term cognitive and psychosocial difficulties. Prospective and systematic long-term follow-up of these patients is essential for early identification and effective management of these problems."
23986248,Using IQ discrepancy scores to examine the neural correlates of specific cognitive abilities,Amy Margolis,"The underlying neural determinants of general intelligence have been studied intensively, and seem to derive from the anatomical and functional characteristics of a frontoparietal network. Little is known, however, about the underlying neural correlates of domain-specific cognitive abilities, the other factors hypothesized to explain individual performance on intelligence tests. Previous preliminary studies have suggested that spatially distinct neural structures do not support domain-specific cognitive abilities. To test whether differences between abilities that affect performance on verbal and performance tasks derive instead from the morphological features of a single anatomical network, we assessed in two independent samples of healthy human participants (N=83 and N=58; age range, 5-57 years) the correlation of cortical thickness with the magnitude of the verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ)-performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) discrepancy. We operationalized the VIQ-PIQ discrepancy by regressing VIQ onto PIQ (VIQ-regressed-on-PIQ score), and by regressing PIQ onto VIQ (PIQ-regressed-on-VIQ score). In both samples, a progressively thinner cortical mantle in anterior and posterior regions bilaterally was associated with progressively greater (more positive) VIQ-regressed-on-PIQ scores. A progressively thicker cortical mantle in anterior and posterior regions bilaterally was associated with progressively greater (more positive) PIQ-regressed-on-VIQ scores. Variation in cortical thickness in these regions accounted for a large portion of the overall variance in magnitude of the VIQ-PIQ discrepancy. The degree of hemispheric asymmetry in cortical thickness accounted for a much smaller but statistically significant portion of variance in VIQ-PIQ discrepancy."
23985797,An Xp22.12 microduplication including RPS6KA3 identified in a family with variably affected intellectual and behavioral disabilities,Ayumi Matsumoto,"The ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 90 kb, polypeptide 3 gene (RPS6KA3) is responsible for Coffin-Lowry syndrome (CLS), which is characterized by intellectual disability (ID) and facial and bony abnormalities. This gene also affects nonsyndromic X-linked ID and nonsyndromic X-linked ID without bony abnormalities. Two families have been previously reported to have genetic microduplication including RPS6KA3. In the present study, we used array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis with Agilent Human genome CGH 180K and detected a 584-kb microduplication spanning 19.92-20.50 Mb of Xp22.12 (including RPS6KA3) in the members of one family, including three brothers, two sisters, and their mother. The 15-year-old male proband and one of his brothers had mild ID and localization-related epilepsy, whereas his other brother presented borderline intelligence quotient (IQ) and attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). One sister presented pervasive development disorder (PDD). Analysis of this family suggests that RPS6KA3 duplication is responsible for mild ID, ADHD, and localization-related epilepsy, and possibly for PDD."
23984869,Inhibition of Myosin light-chain kinase attenuates cerebral edema after traumatic brain injury in postnatal mice,Janet L Rossi,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children less than 8 years of age leads to decline in intelligence and executive functioning. Neurological outcomes after TBI correlate to development of cerebral edema, which affect survival rates after TBI. It has been shown that myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) increases cerebral edema and that pretreatment with an MLCK inhibitor (ML-7) reduces cerebral edema. The aim of this study was to determine whether inhibition of MLCK after TBI in postnatal day 24 (PND-24) mice would prevent breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and development of cerebral edema and improve neurological outcome. We used a closed head injury model of TBI. ML-7 or saline treatment was administered at 4 h and every 24 h until sacrifice or 5 days after TBI. Mice were sacrificed at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h and 7 days after impact. Mice treated with ML-7 after TBI had decreased levels of MLCK-expressing cells (20.7±4.8 vs. 149.3±40.6), less albumin extravasation (28.3±11.2 vs. 116.2±60.7 mm(2)) into surrounding parenchymal tissue, less Evans Blue extravasation (339±314 vs. 4017±560 ng/g), and showed a significant difference in wet/dry weight ratio (1.9±0.07 vs. 2.2±0.05 g), compared to saline-treated groups. Treatment with ML-7 also resulted in preserved neurological function measured by the wire hang test (57 vs. 21 sec) and two-object novel recognition test (old vs. new, 10.5 touches). We concluded that inhibition of MLCK reduces cerebral edema and preserves neurological function in PND-24 mice."
23983726,The relationship between spiritual intelligence with psychological well-being and purpose in life of nurses,Mohammad Sahebalzamani,"Background: Spiritual intelligence is defined as the human capacity to ask questions about the ultimate meaning of life and the integrated relationship between us and the world in which we live. It results in an increase in psychological well-being of individuals as well as having a goal in their life. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between spiritual intelligence with purpose in life and psychological well-being among the nurses. Materials and methods: The study was a descriptive correlation study. In this study, 270 nurses were selected from some hospitals of Tehran University through convenient sampling. Data were collected through a four-section questionnaire including demographic characteristics, a 24-item questionnaire of spiritual intelligence and its four components, psychological well-being questionnaire with six subscales and 84 questions, and the questionnaire of purpose in life with 20 questions. The data obtained from the questionnaires were analyzed through SPSS software. Results: The results showed that there was a significant relationship between spiritual intelligence with psychological well-being and having a purpose in life. Furthermore, there was a significant association between the components of spiritual intelligence including conscious state expansion, personal meaning production, transcendental awareness, and critical existential thinking with psychological well-being. Conclusion: High level of spiritual intelligence in nurses helps them to improve their psychological well-being and have a purpose in life, which can lead to the health provision of them and their patients."
23983466,"Latent class analysis of reading, decoding, and writing performance using the Academic Performance Test: concurrent and discriminating validity",Hugo Cogo-Moreira,"Aim: To explore and validate the best returned latent class solution for reading and writing subtests from the Academic Performance Test (TDE). Sample: A total of 1,945 children (6-14 years of age), who answered the TDE, the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA), and had an estimated intelligence quotient (IQ) higher than 70, came from public schools in São Paulo (35 schools) and Porto Alegre (22 schools) that participated in the 'High Risk Cohort Study for Childhood Psychiatric Disorders' project. They were on average 9.52 years old (standard deviation = 1.856), from the 1st to 9th grades, and 53.3% male. The mean estimated IQ was 102.70 (standard deviation = 16.44). Methods: Via Item Response Theory (IRT), the highest discriminating items ('a'>1.7) were selected from the TDE subtests of reading and writing. A latent class analysis was run based on these subtests. The statistically and empirically best latent class solutions were validated through concurrent (IQ and combined attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] diagnoses) and discriminant (major depression diagnoses) measures. Results: A three-class solution was found to be the best model solution, revealing classes of children with good, not-so-good, or poor performance on TDE reading and writing tasks. The three-class solution has been shown to be correlated with estimated IQ and to ADHD diagnosis. No association was observed between the latent class and major depression. Conclusion: The three-class solution showed both concurrent and discriminant validity. This work provides initial evidence of validity for an empirically derived categorical classification of reading, decoding, and writing performance using the TDE. A valid classification encourages further research investing correlates of reading and writing performance using the TDE."
23982952,Alone again: John Zubek and the troubled history of sensory deprivation research,Mical Raz,"In the 1950s, sensory deprivation research emerged as an influential new field for behavioral science researchers, supported by the intelligence community. Within a few years, deprivation research had become ubiquitous; images of sensory deprivation were invoked to explain a wide range of phenomena, from religious revelations to the very structure of psychoanalysis. Yet within a decade and a half, this field of research became implicated in cases of torture and abuse. This article examines the history of University of Manitoba psychologist John Zubek, who remained one of the final researchers still conducting sensory deprivation research in the 1970s. It raises questions on how might it be possible to successfully and cautiously perform controversial research."
23982469,Low glucose utilization and neurodegenerative changes caused by sodium fluoride exposure in rat's developmental brain,Chunyang Jiang,"Fluorine, a toxic and reactive element, is widely prevalent throughout the environment and can induce toxicity when absorbed into the body. This study was to explore the possible mechanisms of developmental neurotoxicity in rats treated with different levels of sodium fluoride (NaF). The rats' intelligence, as well as changes in neuronal morphology, glucose absorption, and functional gene expression within the brain were determined using the Morris water maze test, transmission electron microscopy, small-animal magnetic resonance imaging and Positron emission tomography and computed tomography, and Western blotting techniques. We found that NaF treatment-impaired learning and memory in these rats. Furthermore, NaF caused neuronal degeneration, decreased brain glucose utilization, decreased the protein expression of glucose transporter 1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein, and increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the rat brains. The developmental neurotoxicity of fluoride may be closely associated with low glucose utilization and neurodegenerative changes."
23982078,Increased parietal activity after training of interference control,Stephan Oelhafen,"Recent studies suggest that computerized cognitive training leads to improved performance in related but untrained tasks (i.e. transfer effects). However, most study designs prevent disentangling which of the task components are necessary for transfer. In the current study, we examined whether training on two variants of the adaptive dual n-back task would affect untrained task performance and the corresponding electrophysiological event-related potentials (ERPs). Forty three healthy young adults were trained for three weeks with a high or low interference training variant of the dual n-back task, or they were assigned to a passive control group. While n-back training with high interference led to partial improvements in the Attention Network Test (ANT), we did not find transfer to measures of working memory and fluid intelligence. ERP analysis in the n-back task and the ANT indicated overlapping processes in the P3 time range. Moreover, in the ANT, we detected increased parietal activity for the interference training group alone. In contrast, we did not find electrophysiological differences between the low interference training and the control group. These findings suggest that training on an interference control task leads to higher electrophysiological activity in the parietal cortex, which may be related to improvements in processing speed, attentional control, or both."
23981295,Raven's matrices and working memory: a dual-task approach,K Venkata Rao,"Raven's Matrices Test was developed as a ""pure"" measure of Spearman's concept of general intelligence, g. Subsequent research has attempted to specify the processes underpinning performance, some relating it to the concept of working memory and proposing a crucial role for the central executive, with the nature of other components currently unclear. Up to this point, virtually all work has been based on correlational analysis of number of correct solutions, sometimes related to possible strategies. We explore the application to this problem of the concurrent task methodology used widely in developing the concept of multicomponent working memory. Participants attempted to solve problems from the matrices under baseline conditions, or accompanied by backward counting or verbal repetition tasks, assumed to disrupt the central executive and phonological loop components of working memory, respectively. As in other uses of this method, number of items correct showed little effect, while solution time measures gave very clear evidence of an important role for the central executive, but no evidence for phonological loop involvement. We conclude that this and related concurrent task techniques hold considerable promise for the analysis of Raven's matrices and potentially for other established psychometric tests."
23981191,An observational study of cognitive function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease,J W Berrill,"Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are associated with several risk factors for developing cognitive impairment. These include altered cytokine levels, concurrent mood disorders, and the presence of chronic pain. This observational study aimed to explore the cognitive profile of patients with these conditions. Methods: Participants completed the Cardiff Cognitive Battery, a series of computerized neuropsychological performance tests that examine a range of cognitive function including psychomotor speed, memory, and intelligence. A progressive analysis of covariance model was used with demographic details, anxiety and depression scores entered as covariates. Fecal calprotectin levels were measured in IBD patients to determine disease activity. Key results: In total 231 participants were recruited (150 IBD patients, 40 IBS patients, and 41 healthy controls). IBD patients had significantly lower scores on fluid (p = 0.01) and crystalline intelligence tests (p = 0.028) compared to healthy volunteers, however, this reflected differences in concurrent mood disorder and level of education. When these factors were added as covariates, there was no significant difference between the groups. Duration and activity of disease did not affect cognitive function in IBD patients. Severity of symptoms had no impact on cognition in patients with IBS. Conclusions & inferences: The results of this observational study do not support the hypothesis that IBS or IBD have an intrinsic disease process that is associated with cognitive dysfunction. It is possible that concurrent mood disorders, in particular depression, may affect the cognitive performance of patients with IBD in specific tasks."
23980936,Telehealth trends and the challenge for infrastructure,Jane Li,"Background: As telehealth takes advantage of improved networks, there is a growing need to understand the infrastructure needs of future telehealth developments. This work aims to predict such needs based on current trends and research. Materials and methods: We conducted a literature review of telehealth with a focus on advanced network infrastructure. We drew inferences from our previous demonstrator projects in advanced telehealth, but the most important findings emerged from interviews with a panel of thought leaders. Results: Our results show that there will be simultaneous and coupled evolution of telehealth through the space spanned by three axes: care models, clinical applications, and technology. We also consider a two-dimensional model of reach and complexity to describe future applications. Universal access to advanced networks will drive fundamental changes in healthcare deliver. The biggest change will be seen in home and mobile health care delivery, forming part of a trend toward patient-centric models. Other aspects of decentralization in healthcare systems will include networks of caregivers. Besides this reach trend, the complexity trend will include integrating multiple-channel applications and seamlessly moving large datasets in real time among hospitals, other medical facilities, and homes. There is a need to provide infrastructure that does not have an upper limit on quality of service and allows telehealth to address mobility, usability, interoperability, intelligence, and adaptability in a systematic way."
23979950,Cognitive development in congenital hypothyroidism: is overtreatment a greater threat than undertreatment?,Jacoba J Bongers-Schokking,"Background: Optimal treatment of children with congenital hypothyroidism (CHT) is still debated. Our objective was to evaluate whether early undertreatment (UT) and overtreatment (OT) influence cognitive development at age 11 years. Methods: Sixty-one patients (27 severe CHT, 34 mild CHT) were psychologically tested at ages 1.8 (Mental Development Index), 6 [intelligence quotient (IQ) 6], and 11 years (IQ11). Scores for cognitive development were related to initial levels of TSH normalization (fast, moderate, or slow) and to total durations of the UT and OT episodes within the first 2 years of life (no, short, or long UT/OT). UT and OT were defined as a free T4 (fT4) concentration below or above the individual fT4 steady-state concentration range (±2 SD). Results: Patients with fast and moderate TSH normalization had higher Mental Development Index scores than patients with slow TSH normalization; 14.2 and 7.7 points higher, respectively (P = .001). TSH normalization had no significant effect on IQ11. Patients with long and short overtreatment had IQ11s that were -17.8 and -13.4 points lower, respectively, than the IQ11s of patients with no overtreatment (P = .014). UT without OT was associated with normal development scores, but UT with OT was associated with -14.7 points lower IQ11s than UT without OT (P = .005). Conclusions: Our study suggests that CHT overtreatment during the first 2 years leads to lowered cognitive outcomes at 11 years, whereas undertreatment, if not complicated by overtreatment, results in a normal cognitive development. Fast TSH normalization at initial treatment leads to above-normal development scores at a young age but does not affect IQ at age 11 years."
23978164,Association between family environment and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children--mothers' and teachers' views,Thiago de Oliveira Pires,"Background: To ascertain whether factors of the family environment and gestational period are associated with the appearance of ADHD in children, as reported by various different informants (mothers and teachers). Methods: This paper presents results from the dataset of a longitudinal study to evaluate behavioral problems among schoolchildren in São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro State, in 2005 and 2006. The cross-section considered for this paper comprises records of exposure factors and ADHD. In all, 370 schoolchildren of the public school system were assessed by 3-stage cluster sampling. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Teacher Report Form (TRF) were used to measure outcomes. The exposure factors examined were: profile of child and mother, variables relating to the family environment, and perinatal considerations. The questions were answered by mothers and teachers. A hierarchical logistic regression model was used. Results: Precariously functioning families, lack of social support for mothers, adverse life events and discord during pregnancy were the factors associated with mother-reported ADHD. When ADHD was reported by teachers, the variables selected were: Intelligence quotient (IQ) and sex, with children with low IQ scores and boys more likely to display the disorder. Conclusions: Assessment of ADHD by teachers or mothers reveals specific characteristics that reflect how each of these informants understands the children. This highlights the importance of using informants from different environments in diagnosing the disorder."
23977075,Infant feeding and school attainment in five cohorts from low- and middle-income countries,Bernardo L Horta,"Background: Performance in intelligence tests tends to be higher among individuals breastfed as infants, but little is known about the association between breastfeeding and achieved schooling. We assessed the association of infant feeding with school achievement in five cohorts from low- and middle-income countries. Unlike high-income country settings where most previous studies come from, breastfeeding is not positively associated with socioeconomic position in our cohorts, thus reducing the likelihood of a spurious positive association. Methodology and principal findings: Participants included 10,082 young adults from five birth cohorts (Brazil, India, Guatemala, the Philippines, and South Africa). The exposures variables were whether the subject was ever breastfed, total duration of breastfeeding, and age at introduction of complementary foods. We adjusted the estimates for age at follow up, sex, maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, birthweight and socioeconomic position at birth. The key outcome was the highest grade achieved at school. In unadjusted analyses, the association between ever breastfeeding and schooling was positive in Brazil, inverse in the Philippines, and null in South Africa; in adjusted analyses, these associations were attenuated. In Brazil, schooling was highest among individuals breastfed for 3-12 months whereas in the Philippines duration of breastfeeding was inversely associated with schooling; and null associations were observed in South Africa and Guatemala. These associations were attenuated in adjusted models. Late introduction of solid foods was associated with lower schooling achievement in Brazil and South Africa. Conclusion: Measures of breastfeeding are not consistently related to schooling achievement in contemporary cohorts of young adults in lower and middle-income countries."
23976855,Executive dysfunction in children affected by obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: an observational study,Maria Esposito,"Introduction: The role of sleep in cognitive processes can be considered clear and well established. Different reports have disclosed the association between sleep and cognition in adults and in children, as well as the impact of disturbed sleep on various aspects of neuropsychological functioning and behavior in children and adolescents. Behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions can also be considered as related to alterations in the executive functions (EF) system. In particular, the EF concept refers to self-regulatory cognitive processes that are associated with monitoring and controlling both thought and goal directed behaviors. The aim of the present study is to assess the impact of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) on EF in a large sample of school aged children. Materials and methods: The study population comprised 79 children (51 males and 28 females) aged 7-12 years (mean 9.14 ± 2.36 years) with OSAS and 92 healthy children (63 males and 29 females, mean age 9.08 ± 2.44 years). To identify the severity of OSAS, an overnight respiratory evaluation was performed. All subjects filled out the Italian version of the Modified Card Sorting Test to screen EFs. Moreover, to check the degree of subjective perceived daytime sleepiness, all subjects were administered the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS). Results: No significant differences between the two study groups were found for age (P = 0.871), gender (P = 0.704), z-score of body mass index (P = 0.656), total intelligence quotient (P = 0.358), and PDSS scores (P = 0.232). The OSAS children showed a significantly higher rate of total errors (P < 0.001), perseverative errors (P < 0.001), nonperseverative errors (P < 0.001), percentage of total errors (P < 0.001), percentage of perseverative errors (P < 0.001), and percentage of nonperseverative errors (P < 0.001). On the other hand, OSAS children showed a significant reduction in the number of completed categories (P = 0.036), total correct sorts (P = 0.001), and categorizing efficiency (P < 0.001). The Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between all error parameters and apnea-hypopnea index, oxygen desaturation index, and percentage of mean desaturation of O2 with a specular negative relationship between the error parameters and the mean oxygen saturation values, such as a significant negative relationship between apnea-hypopnea index, oxygen desaturation index, percent of mean desaturation of O2, and the number of completed categories. Conclusion: Our study identified differences in the executive functioning of children affected by OSAS and is the first to identify a correlation between alteration in respiratory nocturnal parameters and EF that has not yet been reported in developmental age. These findings can be considered as the strength and novelty of the present report in a large pediatric population."
23975905,The role of emotions in clinical reasoning and decision making,James A Marcum,"What role, if any, should emotions play in clinical reasoning and decision making? Traditionally, emotions have been excluded from clinical reasoning and decision making, but with recent advances in cognitive neuropsychology they are now considered an important component of them. Today, cognition is thought to be a set of complex processes relying on multiple types of intelligences. The role of mathematical logic (hypothetico-deductive thinking) or verbal linguistic intelligence in cognition, for example, is well documented and accepted; however, the role of emotional intelligence has received less attention-especially because its nature and function are not well understood. In this paper, I argue for the inclusion of emotions in clinical reasoning and decision making. To that end, developments in contemporary cognitive neuropsychology are initially examined and analyzed, followed by a review of the medical literature discussing the role of emotions in clinical practice. Next, a published clinical case is reconstructed and used to illustrate the recognition and regulation of emotions played during a series of clinical consultations, which resulted in a positive medical outcome. The paper's main thesis is that emotions, particularly in terms of emotional intelligence as a practical form of intelligence, afford clinical practitioners a robust cognitive resource for providing quality medical care."
23974725,Electrophysiological correlates of connotative meaning in healthy children,Wolfgang Skrandies,"The affective, connotative meaning of words can be statistically quantified by the semantic differential technique. Words that are located clearly on one of the three dimensions called ""Evaluation"", ""Potency"", and ""Activity"" were used as visual stimuli in a topographic event related potential study (ERP). Stimuli had been statistically defined in a group of 249 children (Skrandies, Jpn Psychol Res 53: 65-76, 2011). We investigated electrical brain activity in 19 healthy children with normal intelligence and reading skills between 11 and 15 years of age. Words that belonged to different semantic classes were presented at random on a monitor, and EEG was measured from 30 channels. Evoked potentials were computed offline for each semantic class. In the ERP data we observed significant effects of word class on component latency, field strength and topography. Similar as with adult subjects such effects occurred at small latency of about 115 ms after word presentation. The language-evoked components in children were similar but not identical to those reported previously for various groups of adults. Our data show that visually evoked brain activity is modulated by connotative meaning of the stimuli at early processing stages not only in adults but also in children."
23974533,Modeling of nitrate concentration in groundwater using artificial intelligence approach--a case study of Gaza coastal aquifer,Jawad S Alagha,"Nitrate concentration in groundwater is influenced by complex and interrelated variables, leading to great difficulty during the modeling process. The objectives of this study are (1) to evaluate the performance of two artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, namely artificial neural networks and support vector machine, in modeling groundwater nitrate concentration using scant input data, as well as (2) to assess the effect of data clustering as a pre-modeling technique on the developed models' performance. The AI models were developed using data from 22 municipal wells of the Gaza coastal aquifer in Palestine from 2000 to 2010. Results indicated high simulation performance, with the correlation coefficient and the mean average percentage error of the best model reaching 0.996 and 7 %, respectively. The variables that strongly influenced groundwater nitrate concentration were previous nitrate concentration, groundwater recharge, and on-ground nitrogen load of each land use land cover category in the well's vicinity. The results also demonstrated the merit of performing clustering of input data prior to the application of AI models. With their high performance and simplicity, the developed AI models can be effectively utilized to assess the effects of future management scenarios on groundwater nitrate concentration, leading to more reasonable groundwater resources management and decision-making."
23973641,Determinants of intelligence in childhood-onset epilepsy: a single-center study,Jungmee Park,"The purpose of this study was to quantify the intelligence of children with epilepsy and to determine the clinical factors associated with intellectual impairment. The medical records of patients diagnosed with childhood-onset epilepsy at a single tertiary medical center in Korea between 2006 and 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The Korean Education Development Institute-Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children or Korean Wechsler Intelligence Scale for adults was used to quantify the level of intelligence. Age at seizure onset, etiology, epilepsy duration, number of seizures in the last year, use of antiepileptic drugs, EEG/MRI findings, and epilepsy classification were recorded. The association between clinical factors and the intelligence was determined using logistic regression. Three hundred and twenty-two patients were included in the analysis. One hundred and seventy-six (54.7%) patients had low intelligence (intelligence quotient [IQ]<80) with 18 (5.6%) defined as borderline mental retardation (IQ 70-79), 47 (14.6%) as mild mental retardation (IQ 60-69), and 111 (34.5%) as moderate-to-severe mental retardation (IQ<60). Epilepsy duration, number of seizures in the last year, and epilepsy classification were significantly associated with low intelligence in multivariate logistic regression (p<0.05). However, when analyzed according to etiology, these factors were not associated with low intelligence in children with idiopathic epilepsy. The most important factors associated with low intelligence in childhood-onset epilepsy are the underlying etiology and, in cryptogenic and symptomatic epilepsy, seizure burden. The results of this study underscore the importance of seizure control to alleviate the harmful impact of epilepsy on cognition."
23973369,Speech intonation in children with autism spectrum disorder,Yasushi Nakai,"Objective: The prosody of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has several abnormal features. We assessed the speech tone of children with ASD and of children with typical development (TD) by using a new quantitative acoustic analysis. Methods: Our study participants consisted of 63 children (26 with ASD and 37 with TD). The participants were divided into 4 groups based on their developmental features and age. We assessed the variety of the fundamental frequency (F0) pattern quantitatively, using pitch coefficient of variation (CV), considering the different F0 mean for each word. Results: (1) No significant difference was observed between the ASD and TD group at pre-school age. However, the TD group exhibited significantly greater pitch CV than the ASD group at school age. (2) In pitch CV, range and standard deviation of the whole speech of each participant, no significant differences were observed between the type of participants and age. (3) No significant correlation was found between the pitch CV of each word and the Japanese Autism Screening Questionnaire total score, or between the pitch CV of each word and the intelligence quotient levels in the ASD group. A significant correlation was observed between the pitch CV of each word and social reciprocal interaction score. Conclusions: We assessed the speech tone of children with ASD by using a new quantitative method. Monotonous speech in school-aged children with ASD was detected. The extent of monotonous speech was related to the extent of social reciprocal interaction in children with ASD."
23973002,A case for critical ethnography: rethinking the early years of the AIDS epidemic in South Africa,Didier Fassin,"The epidemic of AIDS in South Africa has been characterized not only by its rapid progression but also its impassioned controversies. Retrospectively examining a long-term anthropological project and discussing some reactions it elicited, the paper proposes a defense and illustration of a critical ethnography at three moments of the research. Ethnography is first discussed as fieldworks, proposing an alternative to the horizontal multi-sited approach via a vertical multi-layered method using various scales and locations, and thus connecting the disease endured by patients in townships and former homelands with the heated debates in scientific and political forums: this procedure substitutes a political economy of the disease for its cultural and behavioral interpretations. Ethnography is then discussed as writing, suggesting acknowledgment of the social intelligence of the agents as well as the need for a scientific distance: this principle allows the articulation of the objective historical condition of the individuals and their subjective experience of history, both revealed in the development of the epidemic. Ultimately ethnography is considered from the perspective of its afterlife, that is, the continuous process of its translation by readers and commentators, on the one hand, by the author trying to reach beyond the boundaries of the academic realm, on the other, the work of anthropology appearing as a living object open to public conversation and consequently a resource for knowledge and action."
23970701,Neurocognitive impairment in HIV-infected individuals with previous syphilis,C M Marra,"Cognitive impairment is common in HIV-infected individuals, as is syphilis. Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis, invades the central nervous system early in disease. We hypothesized that HIV-infected patients with a history of syphilis or neurosyphilis would have more cognitive impairment than HIV-infected individuals without these infections. Eighty-two of 1574 enrollees in CHARTER, a prospective, observational study, had reactive serum rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests. They were matched to 84 controls with non-reactive RPR by age, gender, ethnicity and HIV risk factor. Participants underwent comprehensive neuropsychological (NP) evaluations. RPR results were confirmed and serum fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test reactivity determined at a central laboratory. Sera from 101 of 166 participants were FTA-ABS reactive, indicating past or current syphilis. Among the 136 individuals without confounding conditions, compared with patients who had never had syphilis, those with prior syphilis had a greater number of impaired NP test domains (1.90 SD [1.77] versus 1.25 [1.52], P = 0.03), a higher global deficit score (0.47 [0.46] versus 0.31 [0.33], P = 0.03), and more were impaired in the NP learning domain (36 [42.9%] of 84 versus 13 [25.0%] of 52, P = 0.04). These effects of prior syphilis remained after controlling for education and premorbid intelligence."
23969303,Is exposure to secondhand smoke associated with cognitive parameters of children and adolescents?--a systematic literature review,Ruoling Chen,"Purpose: Despite the known association of second hand smoke (SHS) with increased risk of ill health and mortality, the effects of SHS exposure on cognitive functioning in children and adolescents are unclear. Through a critical review of the literature we sought to determine whether a relationship exists between these variables. Methods: The authors systematically reviewed articles (dated 1989-2012) that investigated the association between SHS exposure (including in utero due to SHS exposure by pregnant women) and performance on neurocognitive and academic tests. Eligible studies were identified from searches of Web of Knowledge, MEDLINE, Science Direct, Google Scholar, CINAHL, EMBASE, Zetoc, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Results: Fifteen articles were identified, of which 12 showed inverse relationships between SHS and cognitive parameters. Prenatal SHS exposure was inversely associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes in young children, whereas postnatal SHS exposure was associated with poor academic achievement and neurocognitive performance in older children and adolescents. Furthermore, SHS exposure was associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental delay. Conclusions: Recommendations should be made to the public to avoid sources of SHS and future research should investigate interactions between SHS exposure and other risk factors for delayed neurodevelopment and poor cognitive performance."
23968918,Intelligence,Ian J Deary,Some people are cleverer than others. I think it would be a good thing if more biologists began with that observation as the starting point for their research. Why? Because it is a prominent and consistent way in which people differ from each other; because the measurements we make of people's cleverness produce scores that are correlated with important life outcomes; because it is interesting to discover the mechanisms that produce these individual differences; and because understanding these mechanisms might help to ameliorate those states in which cognitive function is low or declining.
23968819,Stereotactic radiofrequency amygdalohippocampectomy: two years of good neuropsychological outcomes,Hana Malikova,"Purpose: To provide two-year seizure and neuropsychological outcomes in patients treated by stereotactic radiofrequency amygdalohippocampectomy (SAHE), an alternative, minimally invasive method for the treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Material and methods: Thirty-seven MTLE patients treated by SAHE (26 left-sided, 11 right-sided) were included. Patients underwent neuropsychological evaluation by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised preoperatively, 1 year and 2 years after SAHE. Results: Two years after SAHE twenty-eight (75.5%) patients were assessed as Engel Class I and seven (18.9%) patients as Engel Class II. In two patients (5.4%) treatment failed, one of them was classified as Class III and one as Class IV. Irrespective of the laterality of the procedure, the group improved significantly in Global and Verbal Memory Quotients, Attention, Delayed Recall, Semantic Long-term memory subtest and Working Memory. Additionally, increases in Full-scale, Verbal and Visual Intelligence Quotients were detected on the group level. Conclusion: In the present study we report good seizure control and neuropsychological outcomes after SAHE in our patients. We hypothesize that good neuropsychological results were achieved by the incomplete destruction of target structures, sparing the lateral temporal neocortex, and also partially by practice effect. Treatment failures in seizure control may be attributed to larger epileptogenic zones."
23967610,A bibliometric investigation to research fronts of major sub-specialties in internal medicine],Lei Cui,"Objective: To outline the research fronts of ten major sub-specialties in internal medicine. Methods: Based on their impact factor scores and the proportion of the journals of 10 subspecialties (endocrinology & metabolism, cardiac & cardiovascular systems, hematology, infectious diseases, nephrology, gastroenterology & hepatology, respiratory system, rheumatology, critical care medicine, clinical neurology) in Journal Citation Report (JCR), and careful consulation of expert clinicians, we identified 50 journals. Their bibliographic records (including references) published in 2011 were downloaded, and the frequency of the references (citations) in each sub-specialty was counted and the highly cited records were extracted. We performed a clustering analysis according to the co-cited times among any pairs of the highly cited records. To tag each cluster of highly cited records, we browsed the titles and abstracts of all highly cited records in the same cluster, and concluded the main topics of each cluster. Finally, we extracted the current published papers devoted to particular cluster by some clustering analysis indicators. The clusters of highly cited records were considered as the intelligence base, and the main topics in current papers which citing these highly cited papers were considered as research fronts. Results: Totally 50 journals on 10 sub-specialties in internal medicine were identified. A total of 202 highly cited papers, 38 clusters (knowledge bases) , and 152 corresponding current citing papers presenting the research fronts were selected. Conclusions: We confirm and present research fronts in 10 major sub-specialties of internal medicine. This study provides a synchronic structure of contemporary research activities in internal medicine sub-specialties."
23966969,Count on dopamine: influences of COMT polymorphisms on numerical cognition,Annelise Júlio-Costa,"Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is an enzyme that is particularly important for the metabolism of dopamine. Functional polymorphisms of COMT have been implicated in working memory and numerical cognition. This is an exploratory study that aims at investigating associations between COMT polymorphisms, working memory, and numerical cognition. Elementary school children from 2th to 6th grades were divided into two groups according to their COMT val158met polymorphism [homozygous for valine allele (n = 61) vs. heterozygous plus methionine homozygous children or met+ group (n = 94)]. Both groups were matched for age and intelligence. Working memory was assessed through digit span and Corsi blocks. Symbolic numerical processing was assessed through transcoding and single-digit word problem tasks. Non-symbolic magnitude comparison and estimation tasks were used to assess number sense. Between-group differences were found in symbolic and non-symbolic numerical tasks, but not in working memory tasks. Children in the met+ group showed better performance in all numerical tasks while val homozygous children presented slower development of non-symbolic magnitude representations. These results suggest COMT-related dopaminergic modulation may be related not only to working memory, as found in previous studies, but also to the development of magnitude processing and magnitude representations."
23965781,"Underreporting of viral encephalitis and viral meningitis, Ireland, 2005-2008",Tara A Kelly,"Viral encephalitis (VE) and viral meningitis (VM) have been notifiable infectious diseases under surveillance in the Republic of Ireland since 1981. Laboratories have reported confirmed cases by detection of viral nucleic acid in cerebrospinal fluid since 2004. To determine the prevalence of these diseases in Ireland during 2005-2008, we analyzed 3 data sources: Hospital In-patient Enquiry data (from hospitalized following patients discharge) accessed through Health Intelligence Ireland, laboratory confirmations from the National Virus Reference Laboratory, and events from the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting surveillance system. We found that the national surveillance system underestimates the incidence of these diseases in Ireland with a 10-fold higher VE hospitalization rate and 3-fold higher VM hospitalization rate than the reporting rate. Herpesviruses were responsible for most specified VE and enteroviruses for most specified VM from all 3 sources. Recommendations from this study have been implemented to improve the surveillance of these diseases in Ireland."
23964259,Simpson's paradox in psychological science: a practical guide,Rogier A Kievit,"The direction of an association at the population-level may be reversed within the subgroups comprising that population-a striking observation called Simpson's paradox. When facing this pattern, psychologists often view it as anomalous. Here, we argue that Simpson's paradox is more common than conventionally thought, and typically results in incorrect interpretations-potentially with harmful consequences. We support this claim by reviewing results from cognitive neuroscience, behavior genetics, clinical psychology, personality psychology, educational psychology, intelligence research, and simulation studies. We show that Simpson's paradox is most likely to occur when inferences are drawn across different levels of explanation (e.g., from populations to subgroups, or subgroups to individuals). We propose a set of statistical markers indicative of the paradox, and offer psychometric solutions for dealing with the paradox when encountered-including a toolbox in R for detecting Simpson's paradox. We show that explicit modeling of situations in which the paradox might occur not only prevents incorrect interpretations of data, but also results in a deeper understanding of what data tell us about the world."
23964000,Physically developed and exploratory young infants contribute to their own long-term academic achievement,Marc H Bornstein,"A developmental cascade defines a longitudinal relation in which one psychological characteristic uniquely affects another psychological characteristic later in time, separately from other intrapersonal and extrapersonal factors. Here, we report results of a large-scale (N = 374), normative, prospective, 14-year longitudinal, multivariate, multisource, controlled study of a developmental cascade from infant motor-exploratory competence at 5 months to adolescent academic achievement at 14 years, through conceptually related and age-appropriate measures of psychometric intelligence at 4 and 10 years and academic achievement at 10 years. This developmental cascade applied equally to girls and boys and was independent of children's behavioral adjustment and social competence; mothers' supportive caregiving, verbal intelligence, education, and parenting knowledge; and the material home environment. Infants who were more motorically mature and who explored more actively at 5 months of age achieved higher academic levels as 14-year-olds."
23963745,Neurobehavioral profiles in individuals with hyperimmunoglobulin E Syndrome (HIES) and brain white matter hyperintensities,Staci Martin,"Purpose: Individuals with hyperimmunoglobulin E Syndrome (HIES) have central nervous system abnormalities, including focal white matter hyperintensities (WMH), or unidentified bright objects. This cross-sectional study aimed to describe the cognitive and emotional functioning and quality of life of people with HIES. We also sought to explore the relationship between cognitive functioning and WMHs in this population. Methods: Twenty-nine individuals (13 males) with autosomal-dominant HIES (mean age = 35.1 years, range 16-55) were administered a comprehensive psychological assessment as part of a natural history protocol. The assessment included measures of global cognitive functioning (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III), memory (California Verbal Learning Test-II, Wechsler Memory Scale-III), executive skills (Delis Kaplan Executive Function System), and attention (Test of Everyday Attention). Emotional symptoms and quality of life also were assessed. Results: All mean cognitive scores were within normal limits. Mean scores on memory and executive functioning measures were significantly lower than Full Scale IQ scores (ps < .05). Substantial percentages of patients self-reported executive skills to be in the clinical range. Patients with fewer (1-20) versus more (21+) WMHs scored significantly better on measures of global cognitive skills, visual-perceptual skills, and working memory. Mean scores on emotional symptom and quality of life measures were in the average range and unrelated to WMHs. Conclusions: Global cognitive functioning was average to high average in our sample of individuals with HIES. However, focal brain lesions were associated with lower scores in specific domains. Emotional functioning and quality of life are within normal limits in this sample."
23963438,"The influence of sprint interval training on body composition, physical and metabolic fitness in adolescents and young adults with intellectual disability: a randomized controlled trial",Pieter-Henk Boer,"Objective: In this study we evaluated the effect of sprint interval training on metabolic and physical fitness in adolescents and young adults with intellectual disabilities when compared with continuous aerobic training and no training (control). Methods: Fifty-four persons with intellectual disabilities (age: 17 (3.0), body mass index: 27.7 (3.7), intelligence quotient: 59 (8.6)) were matched based on age, gender and intelligence quotient between sprint interval training (n = 17), continuous aerobic training (n = 15) and control (n = 14). Sprint interval training was composed of three blocks of 10 minutes at ventilatory threshold (blocks 1 and 3: 10 sprint bouts of 15 seconds, followed by 45 seconds relative rest; block 2: continuous training) twice a week for 15 weeks. Continuous aerobic training was composed of three blocks of 10 minutes continuous training. After eight weeks, intensity was increased to 110% of ventilatory threshold. The control group did not participate in supervised exercise training. Before and after the training period, body composition, physical and metabolic fitness were evaluated. Results: Sprint interval training showed a significant positive evolution for waist circumference, fat%, systolic blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, peak VO2, peak Watt, ventilatory threshold, 6-minute walk distance and muscle fatigue resistance when compared with no training (P < 0.01). The sprint interval training group demonstrated significant improvements for fat%, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein, fasting insulin, peak VO2 and peak power and ventilatory threshold (P < 0.01) when compared with continuous aerobic training. Conclusion: In this study we could observe that sprint interval training has stronger beneficial effects on body composition, physical fitness and metabolic fitness compared with control. Compared with continuous aerobic training, sprint interval training seems to result in better outcome."
23962604,The Self- and Other-Deception Questionnaires-Intellectual Disabilities (SDQ-ID and ODQ-ID): component analysis and reliability,Laura Jobson,"The objectives of this research were to: (1) investigate the component structure and psychometric properties of the Self- and Other-Deception Questionnaires-Intellectual Disabilities (SDQ-ID and ODQ-ID), (2) examine the relationship between social desirability and IQ, and (3) compare social desirability scores of those with intellectual disabilities (IDs) and a history of criminal offending to the social desirability scores of participants with IDs and those without IDs and no such history, controlling for general intellectual functioning. Men with mild to borderline IDs detained within medium secure inpatient forensic mental health services (N=40) completed the SDQ-ID and ODQ-ID at Time 1 and then two-weeks later at Time 2. Data for the men with and without IDs and no known criminal offending history were taken from a previous study (N=60). Following exploratory Principal Components Analysis, the number of questionnaire items were reduced, and a two-factor structure was found for the SDQ-ID which was labelled: (1) Positive Self Representation and (2) Denial of Intrusive Thoughts. A two-factor structure was also found for the ODQ-ID and these two factors were labelled: (1) Denial of Negative Social Interaction and (2) Untrustworthiness. Both the SDQ-ID and ODQ-ID had acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Fifteen percent of the variance in SDQ-ID scores was explained by Full Scale IQ, while 21% of the variance in ODQ-ID scores was explained by Full Scale IQ. Between group comparisons controlling for intelligence did not yield any significant differences. The shortened SDQ-ID and ODQ-ID have promising psychometric properties, and their component structures appear robust. Differences between men with and without IDs on these two measures of social desirability can be accounted for by differences in general intellectual functioning."
23962600,Development of a Mandarin Expressive and Receptive Vocabulary Test for children using cochlear implants,Xiaopan Lu,"Cochlear implants (CIs) provide children with profound hearing loss access to sounds and speech. Research on the effects of CI on speech and language development in mainland China is scarce due to the lack of standardized tests. This study aims at developing a vocabulary measure, the Mandarin Expressive and Receptive Vocabulary Test (MERVT), for pre-school children with CIs. Using responses from 102 normal-hearing preschool children, the initial vocabulary set was subjected to analyses to identify items with appropriate levels of difficulty and discrimination. Norms on 245 normal-hearing children aged 1;6 to 3;11 were later collected based on the final set of the items. Evaluation of the test's psychometric properties revealed good internal consistency. Significant correlations between the total MERVT scores and the Gesell Developmental Scale scores, between the MERVT expressive and receptive subtest scores and the total scores, and the gradual increase in MERVT scores with age, provided evidence of construct validity. Results from 29 children with CIs were also examined for evidence of the MERVT's construct validity. There was a significant correlation between these children's MERVT scores and their scores from an intelligence test. The MERVT scores increased with an increase in the duration of CI use and in chronological age. With good reliability and strong validity, the test is recommended for use in the monitoring of language development in children with CI."
23961391,Gravity inversion of a fault by Particle swarm optimization (PSO),Reza Toushmalani,"Particle swarm optimization is a heuristic global optimization method and also an optimization algorithm, which is based on swarm intelligence. It comes from the research on the bird and fish flock movement behavior. In this paper we introduce and use this method in gravity inverse problem. We discuss the solution for the inverse problem of determining the shape of a fault whose gravity anomaly is known. Application of the proposed algorithm to this problem has proven its capability to deal with difficult optimization problems. The technique proved to work efficiently when tested to a number of models."
23959883,Two distinct forms of functional lateralization in the human brain,Stephen J Gotts,"The hemispheric lateralization of certain faculties in the human brain has long been held to be beneficial for functioning. However, quantitative relationships between the degree of lateralization in particular brain regions and the level of functioning have yet to be established. Here we demonstrate that two distinct forms of functional lateralization are present in the left vs. the right cerebral hemisphere, with the left hemisphere showing a preference to interact more exclusively with itself, particularly for cortical regions involved in language and fine motor coordination. In contrast, right-hemisphere cortical regions involved in visuospatial and attentional processing interact in a more integrative fashion with both hemispheres. The degree of lateralization present in these distinct systems selectively predicted behavioral measures of verbal and visuospatial ability, providing direct evidence that lateralization is associated with enhanced cognitive ability."
23959778,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for autism spectrum disorders (ASD),Katrina Williams,"Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterised by abnormalities in social interaction and communication skills, as well as stereotypic behaviours and restricted activities and interests. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are prescribed for the treatment of conditions often comorbid with ASD such as depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behaviours. Objectives: To determine if treatment with an SSRI:1. improves the core features of autism (social interaction, communication and behavioural problems);2. improves other non-core aspects of behaviour or function such as self-injurious behaviour;3. improves the quality of life of adults or children and their carers;4. has short- and long-term effects on outcome;5. causes harm. Search methods: We searched the following databases up until March 2013: CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC and Sociological Abstracts. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). This was supplemented by searching reference lists and contacting known experts in the field. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any dose of oral SSRI compared with placebo, in people with ASD. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and appraised each study's risk of bias. Main results: Nine RCTs with a total of 320 participants were included. Four SSRIs were evaluated: fluoxetine (three studies), fluvoxamine (two studies), fenfluramine (two studies) and citalopram (two studies). Five studies included only children and four studies included only adults. Varying inclusion criteria were used with regard to diagnostic criteria and intelligence quotient of participants. Eighteen different outcome measures were reported. Although more than one study reported data for Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and obsessive-compulsive behaviour (OCB), different tool types or components of these outcomes were used in each study. As such, data were unsuitable for meta-analysis, except for one outcome (proportion improvement). One large, high-quality study in children showed no evidence of positive effect of citalopram. Three small studies in adults showed positive outcomes for CGI and OCB; one study showed improvements in aggression, and another in anxiety. Authors' conclusions: There is no evidence of effect of SSRIs in children and emerging evidence of harm. There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of SSRIs in adults from small studies in which risk of bias is unclear."
23958644,"Countering the demand for, and supply of, illicit tobacco: an assessment of the 'North of England Tackling Illicit Tobacco for Better Health' Programme",Ann McNeill,"Background: Illicit tobacco (IT) undermines the effectiveness of tobacco control strategies. We assessed the implementation and impact of a new programme designed to reduce demand for, as well as supply of, IT, in the north of England, where IT was prevalent. Methods: 'Mixed methods' research was undertaken. Qualitative methods included stakeholder interviews (at outset and 1 year later) and ethnographic research. Indicators reflecting those supply and demand issues for which data were available were identified and monitored, including relevant items on two cross-sectional surveys carried out in 2009 and 2011 with over 4000 individuals from which a social marketing campaign was also developed. IT reports to two existing hotlines, promoted through the programme, were assessed. Results: Initially, concerns abounded about the different philosophies and ways of working of local and national enforcement and health agencies, but these were much reduced at follow-up. A protocol was developed which greatly facilitated the flow of intelligence about IT supply. A social marketing campaign was developed highlighting two messages: IT makes it easier for children to start smoking and brings crime into the community, thereby avoiding misleading messages about relative harms of illicit and licit tobacco. Public and stakeholder awareness of IT increased as did calls to both hotlines. Conclusions: A partnership of agencies, with competing values, was established to tackle IT, a complex public health issue and, inter alia, implemented a social marketing campaign using novel messages. This improved the flow of intelligence about the supply of IT and increased awareness of IT."
23957689,"Emotionally unskilled, unaware, and uninterested in learning more: reactions to feedback about deficits in emotional intelligence",Oliver J Sheldon,"Despite the importance of self-awareness for managerial success, many organizational members hold overly optimistic views of their expertise and performance-a phenomenon particularly prevalent among those least skilled in a given domain. We examined whether this same pattern extends to appraisals of emotional intelligence (EI), a critical managerial competency. We also examined why this overoptimism tends to survive explicit feedback about performance. Across 3 studies involving professional students, we found that the least skilled had limited insight into deficits in their performance. Moreover, when given concrete feedback, low performers disparaged either the accuracy or the relevance of that feedback, depending on how expediently they could do so. Consequently, they expressed more reluctance than top performers to pursue various paths to self-improvement, including purchasing a book on EI or paying for professional coaching. Paradoxically, it was top performers who indicated a stronger desire to improve their EI following feedback."
23957224,Longitudinal mediation of processing speed on age-related change in memory and fluid intelligence,Annie Robitaille,"Age-related decline in processing speed has long been considered a key driver of cognitive aging. While the majority of empirical evidence for the processing speed hypothesis has been obtained from analyses of between-person age differences, longitudinal studies provide a direct test of within-person change. Using recent developments in longitudinal mediation analysis, we examine the speed-mediation hypothesis at both the within-and between-person levels in two longitudinal studies, Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) and Origins of Variance in the Oldest-Old (OCTO-Twin). We found significant within-person indirect effects of change in age, such that increasing age was related to lower speed, which in turn relates to lower performance across repeated measures on other cognitive outcomes. Although between-person indirect effects were also significant in LASA, they were not in OCTO-Twin which is not unexpected given the age homogeneous nature of the OCTO-Twin data. A more in-depth examination through measures of effect size suggests that, for the LASA study, the within-person indirect effects were small and between-person indirect effects were consistently larger. These differing magnitudes of direct and indirect effects across levels demonstrate the importance of separating between- and within-person effects in evaluating theoretical models of age-related change."
23957184,Using business intelligence to manage supply costs,Ernest Bunata,Business intelligence tools can help materials managers and managers in the operating room and procedural areas track purchasing costs more precisely and determine the root causes of cost increases. Data can be shared with physicians to increase their awareness of the cost of physician preference items. Proper use of business intelligence goes beyond price benchmarking to manage price performance over time.
23956988,Behavioral profiles of clinically referred children with intellectual giftedness,Fabian Guénolé,"It is common that intellectually gifted children--that is, children with an IQ ≥ 130--are referred to paediatric or child neuropsychiatry clinics for socio-emotional problems and/or school underachievement or maladjustment. These clinically-referred children with intellectual giftedness are thought to typically display internalizing problems (i.e., self-focused problems reflecting overcontrol of emotion and behavior), and to be more behaviorally impaired when ""highly"" gifted (IQ ≥ 145) or displaying developmental asynchrony (i.e., a heterogeneous developmental pattern, reflected in a significant verbal-performance discrepancy on IQ tests). We tested all these assumptions in 143 clinically-referred gifted children aged 8 to 12, using Wechsler's intelligence profile and the Child Behavior Checklist. Compared to a normative sample, gifted children displayed increased behavioral problems in the whole symptomatic range. Internalizing problems did not predominate over externalizing ones (i.e., acted-out problems, reflecting undercontrol of emotion and behavior), revealing a symptomatic nature of behavioral syndromes more severe than expected. ""Highly gifted"" children did not display more behavioral problems than the ""low gifted."" Gifted children with a significant verbal-performance discrepancy displayed more externalizing problems and mixed behavioral syndromes than gifted children without such a discrepancy. These results suggest that developmental asynchrony matters when examining emotional and behavioral problems in gifted children."
23956016,Use of computerized algorithm to identify individuals in need of testing for celiac disease,Jonas F Ludvigsson,"Background and aim: Celiac disease (CD) is a lifelong immune-mediated disease with excess mortality. Early diagnosis is important to minimize disease symptoms, complications, and consumption of healthcare resources. Most patients remain undiagnosed. We developed two electronic medical record (EMR)-based algorithms to identify patients at high risk of CD and in need of CD screening. Methods: (I) Using natural language processing (NLP), we searched EMRs for 16 free text (and related) terms in 216 CD patients and 280 controls. (II) EMRs were also searched for ICD9 (International Classification of Disease) codes suggesting an increased risk of CD in 202 patients with CD and 524 controls. For each approach, we determined the optimal number of hits to be assigned as CD cases. To assess performance of these algorithms, sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results: Using two hits as the cut-off, the NLP algorithm identified 72.9% of all celiac patients (sensitivity), and ruled out CD in 89.9% of the controls (specificity). In a representative US population of individuals without a prior celiac diagnosis (assuming that 0.6% had undiagnosed CD), this NLP algorithm could identify a group of individuals where 4.2% would have CD (positive predictive value). ICD9 code search using three hits as the cut-off had a sensitivity of 17.1% and a specificity of 88.5% (positive predictive value was 0.9%). Discussion and conclusions: This study shows that computerized EMR-based algorithms can help identify patients at high risk of CD. NLP-based techniques demonstrate higher sensitivity and positive predictive values than algorithms based on ICD9 code searches."
23954868,"Lack of association between genetic polymorphisms in ROBO1, MRPL19/C2ORF3 and THEM2 with developmental dyslexia",Shyamala K Venkatesh,"Developmental Dyslexia (DD) is a heritable, complex genetic disorder characterized by specific impairment in reading and writing ability that is substantially below the expected reading ability given the person's chronological age, measured intelligence and age-appropriate education. More than ten susceptible genes have been identified for DD. A Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) of these genes was found to be associated with various phenotypes of DD. To identify the role of SNPs of four candidate genes namely, MRPL19/C2ORF3, ROBO1 and THEM2 in an Indian population, we genotyped eight SNPs of these genes in 157 children with DD and 212 normal readers using a MassARRAY technique with a MALDI-TOF MS analyzer. Power analysis of some of these SNPs showed >80% of power. Chi-square test, Odds Ratios (ORs), 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and Bonferroni's correction were applied to identify the significance of the genotyped SNPs and haplotypes. Our study failed to show any association of SNPs and haplotypes of these genes with DD in an Indian population."
23953938,Brainstem auditory evoked potentials with the use of acoustic clicks and complex verbal sounds in young adults with learning disabilities,Sophia N Kouni,"Purpose and background: Acoustic signals are transmitted through the external and middle ear mechanically to the cochlea where they are transduced into electrical impulse for further transmission via the auditory nerve. The auditory nerve encodes the acoustic sounds that are conveyed to the auditory brainstem. Multiple brainstem nuclei, the cochlea, the midbrain, the thalamus, and the cortex constitute the central auditory system. In clinical practice, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to simple stimuli such as click or tones are widely used. Recently, complex stimuli or complex auditory brain responses (cABRs), such as monosyllabic speech stimuli and music, are being used as a tool to study the brainstem processing of speech sounds. We have used the classic 'click' as well as, for the first time, the artificial successive complex stimuli 'ba', which constitutes the Greek word 'baba' corresponding to the English 'daddy'. Patients and methods: Twenty young adults institutionally diagnosed as dyslexic (10 subjects) or light dyslexic (10 subjects) comprised the diseased group. Twenty sex-, age-, education-, hearing sensitivity-, and IQ-matched normal subjects comprised the control group. Measurements included the absolute latencies of waves I through V, the interpeak latencies elicited by the classical acoustic click, the negative peak latencies of A and C waves, as well as the interpeak latencies of A-C elicited by the verbal stimulus 'baba' created on a digital speech synthesizer. Results: The absolute peak latencies of waves I, III, and V in response to monoaural rarefaction clicks as well as the interpeak latencies I-III, III-V, and I-V in the dyslexic subjects, although increased in comparison with normal subjects, did not reach the level of a significant difference (p<0.05). However, the absolute peak latencies of the negative wave C and the interpeak latencies of A-C elicited by verbal stimuli were found to be increased in the dyslexic group in comparison with the control group (p=0.0004 and p=0.045, respectively). In the subgroup consisting of 10 patients suffering from 'other learning disabilities' and who were characterized as with 'light' dyslexia according to dyslexia tests, no significant delays were found in peak latencies A and C and interpeak latencies A-C in comparison with the control group. Conclusions: Acoustic representation of a speech sound and, in particular, the disyllabic word 'baba' was found to be abnormal, as low as the auditory brainstem. Because ABRs mature in early life, this can help to identify subjects with acoustically based learning problems and apply early intervention, rehabilitation, and treatment. Further studies and more experience with more patients and pathological conditions such as plasticity of the auditory system, cochlear implants, hearing aids, presbycusis, or acoustic neuropathy are necessary until this type of testing is ready for clinical application."
23952646,Schooling and variation in the COMT gene: the devil is in the details,Daniel Campbell,"Background: Schooling is considered one of the major contributors to the development of intelligence within societies and individuals. Genetic variation might modulate the impact of schooling and explain, at least partially, the presence of individual differences in classrooms. Method: We studied a sample of 1,502 children (mean age = 11.7 years) from Zambia. Approximately 57% of these children were enrolled in school, and the rest were not. To quantify genetic variation, we investigated a number of common polymorphisms in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene that controls the production of the protein thought to account for >60% of the dopamine degradation in the prefrontal cortex. Results: Haplotype analyses generated results ranging from the presence to absence of significant interactions between a number of COMT haplotypes and indicators of schooling (i.e., in- vs. out-of-school and grade completed) in the prediction of nonverbal intelligence, depending on the parameter specification. However, an investigation of the distribution of corresponding p-values suggested that these positive results were false. Conclusions: Convincing evidence that the variation in the COMT gene is associated with individual differences in nonverbal intelligence either directly or through interactions with schooling was not found. p-values produced by the method of testing for haplotype effects employed here may be sensitive to parameter settings, invalid under default settings, and should be checked for validity through simulation."
23951949,Gender and gender role differences in self- and other-estimates of multiple intelligences,Agata Szymanowicz,"This study examined participant gender and gender role differences in estimates of multiple intelligences for self, partner, and various hypothetical, stereotypical, and counter-stereotypical target persons. A general population sample of 261 British participants completed one of four questionnaires that required them to estimate their own and others' multiple intelligences and personality traits. Males estimated their general IQ slightly, but mathematic IQ significantly higher than females, who rated their social and emotional intelligence higher than males. Masculine individuals awarded themselves somewhat higher verbal and practical IQ scores than did female participants. Both participant gender and gender role differences in IQ estimates were found, with gender effects stronger in cognitive and gender role than in ""personal"" ability estimates. There was a significant effect of gender role on hypothetical persons' intelligence evaluations, with masculine targets receiving significantly higher intelligence estimates compared to feminine targets. More intelligent hypothetical figures were judged as more masculine and less feminine than less intelligent ones."
23950760,"Human migration, diversity and disease association: a convergent role of established and emerging DNA markers",Pokhraj Guha,"With the gradual development of intelligence, human got curious to know his origin and evolutionary background. Historical statements and anthropological findings were his primary tool for solving the puzzles of his own origin, until came the golden era of molecular markers which took no time to prove it's excellence in unveiling answers to the questions regarding the migration pattern of human across different geographical regions. As a bonus these markers proved very much beneficial in solving criminal offenses and in understanding the etiology of many dreaded diseases and to design their prevention. In this review, we have aimed to throw light on some of the promising molecular markers which are very much in application now-a-days for not only understanding the evolutionary background and ancient migratory routes of humans but also in the field of forensics and human health."
23950755,Administration of neuropsychological tests using interactive voice response technology in the elderly: validation and limitations,Delyana Ivanova Miller,"Interactive voice response (IVR) systems are computer programs, which interact with people to provide a number of services from business to health care. We examined the ability of an IVR system to administer and score a verbal fluency task (fruits) and the digit span forward and backward in 158 community dwelling people aged between 65 and 92 years of age (full scale IQ of 68-134). Only six participants could not complete all tasks mostly due to early technical problems in the study. Participants were also administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale fourth edition (WAIS-IV) and Wechsler Memory Scale fourth edition subtests. The IVR system correctly recognized 90% of the fruits in the verbal fluency task and 93-95% of the number sequences in the digit span. The IVR system typically underestimated the performance of participants because of voice recognition errors. In the digit span, these errors led to the erroneous discontinuation of the test: however the correlation between IVR scoring and clinical scoring was still high (93-95%). The correlation between the IVR verbal fluency and the WAIS-IV Similarities subtest was 0.31. The correlation between the IVR digit span forward and backward and the in-person administration was 0.46. We discuss how valid and useful IVR systems are for neuropsychological testing in the elderly."
23950572,Aging and speech perception: beyond hearing threshold and cognitive ability,Leah Fostick,"Background: Older adults manifest difficulties in speech perception, especially when speech is accompanied by noise or when speech is rapid. Several explanations have been suggested to account for age-related changes in speech perception, such as changes in hearing sensitivity or a more general decline in cognitive functioning. The purpose of the present study was to directly examine the relative contribution of hearing sensitivity and perceptual and cognitive factors in the understanding of age-related differences in speech perception under difficult conditions. Methods: Eighty-nine healthy participants with normal hearing thresholds, age 21-82 years, were tested for speech perception under four conditions: quiet, speech noise, white noise, and time-compressed speech at 60% compression rate. As all participants had age-normal hearing, absolute thresholds were tested for click trains, 1 kHz 15-ms duration pure tone, 1 kHz 50-ms duration pure tone, and 1.8 kHz 15-ms duration pure tone, which are relatively short and discriminative for hearing ability. Cognitive ability was examined using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Third Edition) matrices and digit span. Results: When words were presented against a quiet background or against white noise, speech perception was not significantly affected by aging, although in the latter case, increased thresholds predicted poorer speech perception. However, when words were presented against a background of speech noise or when speech was time-compressed at a 60% rate, age significantly predicted a decline in speech perception, even after controlling for hearing thresholds and cognitive functioning. Conclusions: Hearing threshold for short sounds is the major factor for predicting speech perception in background noise, across age, due to changes in hearing sensitivity or in temporal resolution. For the adult and aging population with preserved cognitive ability, cognitive functioning does not predict decline in speech perception."
23949082,Relation between cingulum injury and cognition in chronic patients with traumatic brain injury; diffusion tensor tractography study,Seung Ok Baek,"Objectives: Many diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have reported an association between cingulum injury and cognition in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) using DTI parameters. In this study, we attempted to investigate the relation between cingulum injury and cognition in chronic patients with TBI, using the integrity of the cingulum as well as DTI parameters. Method: Thirty five consecutive chronic patients with TBI were recruited. The intelligence quotient (IQ) of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale and Memory Assessment Scale (MAS) was used for assessment of cognition. The patients were classified into three groups, according to continuity to the lower portion of the genu of the corpus callosum: type A-both sides of the cingulum showed intact continuity, type B-either cingulum showed a discontinuation, and, type C-both cingulums showed discontinuation. We measured the fractional anisotropy (FA), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and voxel number of both cingulums. Results: The IQ and MAS scores of type A and B were significantly higher than those of type C, respectively (p < 0.05), however, we did not observe a significant difference between type A and type B (p > 0.05). A positive correlation was observed between the FA value of the cingulum, and IQ and MAS, respectively (IQ r = 0.373, p < 0.05, MAS r = 0.357, p < 0.05), and between the voxel number and MAS (r = 0.500, p < 0.05). By contrast, we observed a negative correlation between the ADC value and IQ (r = -0.353, p < 0.05). Conclusion: In terms of integrity to the basal forebrain and DTI parameters of the injured cingulum, DTI findings showed a close association with whole cognition and memory in chronic patients with TBI."
23947758,Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition profiles and their relationship to self-reported outcome following traumatic brain injury,Yasmin E Harman-Smith,"Neuropsychological assessments of outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often unrelated to self-reported problems after TBI. The current study cluster-analyzed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III) subtest scores from mild, moderate, and severe TBI (n=220) and orthopedic injury control (n=95) groups, to determine whether specific cognitive profiles are related to people's perceived outcomes after TBI. A two-stage cluster analysis produced 4- and 6-cluster solutions, with the 6-cluster solution better capturing subtle variations in cognitive functioning. The 6 clusters differed in the levels and profiles of cognitive performance, self-reported recovery, and education and injury severity. The findings suggest that subtle cognitive impairments after TBI should be interpreted in conjunction with patient's self-reported problems."
23947288,Environmental health--champions of One Health,Christopher Eddy,"The authors find overwhelming evidence among environmental health practitioners that One Health disease reporting concepts are essential to the early detection of, and expedient recovery from, pandemic disease events. The authors also find, however, extraordinary evidence that local public health is not prepared, and potentially unaware of their responsibility, to be the initiator of the zoonotic infectious disease information intelligence necessary to make such early event mitigation possible. The authors propose that NEHA take an affirmative step towards the development of local public health-initiated biosurveillance systems by organizing and leading a tabletop study group that includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Veterinary Medical Association, American Medical Association, Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Institute of Medicine, and a robust panel of NEHA state affiliates. This study group should discuss the infrastructure necessary for local public health-the frontline against community-acquired infectious disease-to be the initiators of environmental health, veterinary, and medical One Health biosurveillance systems. The need to establish a community-focused, integrated disease prevention strategy that cautions people about the risks associated with food, water, animal, and contaminated environmental media, both prior to and during epidemic and pandemic events is equally important."
23946339,"Diet quality of U.K. infants is associated with dietary, adiposity, cardiovascular, and cognitive outcomes measured at 7-8 years of age",Rebecca K Golley,"Whereas the influence of pregnancy diet and milk feeding on children's health and development is well characterized, the role of early food intake and eating behaviors is largely unexplored. This study aimed to determine whether the degree of adherence to complementary feeding guidelines was associated with dietary, obesity, cardiovascular, and cognitive outcomes at 7-8 y of age. Data were analyzed from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children using parent-completed dietary questionnaires at 6 mo of age to calculate a Complementary Feeding Utility Index score. Regression analysis was used to explore associations between the index score and dietary patterns derived via principal component analysis (n = 4326), body-mass index (BMI) (n = 4801), waist circumference (n = 4798), blood pressure (n = 4685), and lipids (n = 3232) measured at age 7 y; and intelligence quotient (IQ) measured at age 8 y (n = 4429) after adjustment for covariates. The index score was negatively associated with a ""processed"" dietary pattern (β = -0.16; 95% CI: -0.20, -0.13; P < 0.001) but positively associated with a ""health conscious"" dietary pattern [β = 0.18 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.21); P < 0.001]. A higher index score was also positively associated with total, verbal, and performance IQ scores at 8 y of age [β = 1.92 (95%CI: 1.38, 2.47); P < 0.001 for total IQ). The index score was weakly associated with waist circumference [β = -0.15 (95%CI: -0.31, -0.002); P = 0.046] and diastolic blood pressure [β = -0.24 (95%CI: -0.47, -0.01); P = 0.043] at 7 y of age but was not associated with BMI or other cardiovascular risk factors. These findings suggest that adherence to current complementary feeding guidelines may have implications for some, but not all, health and development outcomes in childhood."
23946307,Cognitive functioning before and after surgical resection for hypothalamic hamartoma and epilepsy,Jennifer V Wethe,"Objective: To determine whether patients with hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) improve in their cognitive functioning after neurosurgical resection of their HH and explore what variables correlate with cognitive outcome. Methods: Thirty-two patients underwent preoperative and postoperative neuropsychological testing. The age range of patients was between 3.3 and 39.3 years (mean 12.2 years, SD 7.0). The average time interval between surgery and postoperative neuropsychological testing was 23.4 months (range 5.1-47.2 months). Tests administered varied on the basis of the patient's age and clinical condition. Results: As a group, measures of overall intelligence showed improvement postsurgery, with associated improvement in processing speed. Memory scores did not demonstrate consistent improvement or decline. Duration of epilepsy, age at surgery, and level of neurocognitive functioning prior to surgery were correlated with postsurgical cognitive status. Patients who had mental retardation but were testable generally showed the greatest gains. Conclusions: Despite the great variability in level of cognitive impairment in patients with HH and refractory epilepsy, level of intelligence may show mild to moderate improvements postsurgery if no surgical complications occur. The variables that predict cognitive outcome are not fully delineated, but testable individuals with the greatest presurgical cognitive impairment and those with the shortest duration of epilepsy appear to make the greatest gains in intellectual functioning. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that single surgical resection for HH was associated with improvement in some subset measures of intellectual functioning, but not memory. Factors that predict better outcomes cannot be determined."
23945597,Visual-spatial cognition in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome: the role of androgens,J A Barry,"Study question: Are women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) better at three-dimensional mental rotation than other women? Summary answer: Women with PCOS scored significantly higher on a mental rotation task than a female control group. What is known already: PCOS is a condition characterized by elevated testosterone levels. Some researches have found that three-dimensional mental rotation task performance is positively correlated with testosterone levels. Study design, size, duration: This cross-sectional study was conducted between June 2006 and January 2009. The participants were 69 women with PCOS and 41 controls recruited from five gynaecology clinics in London. The control group consisted of non-PCOS women of comparable subfertility to PCOS group. These groups sizes gave roughly 80% power to detect moderate effect sizes for the main statistical test. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Participants were recruited at London gynaecology clinics. The women were aged between 18 and 43. PCOS was diagnosed based on the Rotterdam criteria. Controls were women who experienced some degree of subfertility. Blood samples from participants were frozen for up to 4 months until being assayed by direct electrochemiluminescence. The mental rotation task was undertaken electronically. Some questionnaires and other tasks were completed as control measures. Main results and the role of chance: Women with PCOS scored significantly higher than controls: median (range) 3.00 (0-9) and 2.00 (0-8), respectively (U = 1147.500, N1 = 69, N2 = 41, P < 0.047). Within the PCOS group, circulating levels of testosterone were significantly positively correlated with three-dimensional scoring (rs = 0.376, n = 56, P < 0.002), whereas estradiol was significantly negatively correlated with three-dimensional scoring (rs = -0.473, n = 29, P < 0.010). In the control group, the relationship between sex hormones and mental rotation was non-significant. Other factors, including general intelligence and social class, did not account for these findings. A subgroup analysis comparing hyperandrogenic PCOS cases, non-hyperandrogenic PCOS cases and controls, in which age and body mass index were controlled for using ANCOVA, found a non-significant difference in three-dimensional scoring between the three groups (F = 1.062, d.f. = 1, 73, P < 0.351). Limitations, reasons for caution: The small number of women in the control group meant that correlations were underpowered in this group. Wider implications of the findings: This study is the first to find a benefit of PCOS in visuospatial cognition, and the first to find a link between visuospatial cognition and sex hormones in PCOS. The fact that the correlations went in the opposite direction in the PCOS group compared with the controls might suggest the influence of increased prenatal exposure to androgen in PCOS. Study funding/competing interest(s): The assays for this study were funded by the Department of Psychology, City University London. All authors report no conflicts of interest."
23944117,Psychiatric issues of children and adults with autism spectrum disorders who remain undiagnosed],Yoko Kamio,"Individuals of normal intelligence with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) tend to be diagnosed with ASD late in childhood or sometimes in adulthood, despite a persistent symptomatology. When such patients visit psychiatric clinics for co-occurring psychiatric symptoms, the diagnostic procedure can be challenging due to a lack of accurate developmental information and a mixed clinical presentation. The same is true for those with subthreshold autistic symptoms. Although individuals with subthreshold ASD also have social adjustment difficulties of a similar degree to those with ASD, the relative clinical significance of this population is unclear. Here, data from a large national population sample of schoolchildren were examined to determine the psychiatric needs of children with threshold and subthreshold autistic symptoms. First, autistic symptoms or traits assessed by the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a quantitative behavioral measure, showed a continuous distribution in the general child population (n = 22,529), indicating no evidence of a natural gap that could differentiate children diagnosed with ASD from subthreshold or unaffected children. Second, data from 25,075 children demonstrated that having threshold autistic symptoms predicted a high psychiatric risk, as indicated by higher scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; odds ratio [OR] 200.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 152.12-264.33), and that having subthreshold autistic symptoms indicated the same (OR 12.78, 95% CI: 11.52-14.18). Having threshold autistic symptoms predicted emotional problems (OR 20.19, 95% CI: 17.00-24.00), as did having subthreshold autistic symptoms (OR 5.90, 95% CI: 5.29-6.58). Third, among 2,250 children at a high psychiatric risk, most had threshold or subthreshold autistic symptoms (21 and 44%, respectively). These findings have important implications for the comprehensive psychiatric and developmental evaluation and treatment of this patient population, whose diagnosis and treatment are often delayed, and a further in-depth study is warranted."
23943689,Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in Congenital Strabismus,Abbas Bagheri,"Purpose: To evaluate intelligence quotient (IQ) in patients with congenital strabismus. Methods: All patients with congenital strabismus scheduled for surgery were enrolled consecutively over a one year period in a cross-sectional study and were evaluated for verbal, performance and total IQ scores, and compared to the mean normal IQ of 100±15. Results: During the study period, 109 patients with mean age of 18.4±10.5 (range, 4-63) years were included. Educational status in most patients (80%) was less than high-school. Most patients (80%) lived in urban areas and 46 patients (42.2%) had some degrees of unilateral or bilateral amblyopia. Mean verbal IQ was 87.2±19.6 (range, 45-127), performance IQ was 81±15.5 (range, 44-111) and total IQ was 83.5±18.3 (range, 40-120). Total IQ was significantly lower in comparison to the normal population (P<0.01) and significantly higher in urban as compared to rural residents (85.1±19.5 versus 77.3±10.8 respectively, P=0.02). Patients with coexisting amblyopia and alternate deviation had lower IQ levels. Verbal IQ was insignificantly higher in myopes than emmetropes and hyperopes. IQ was better with vertical deviations and was higher in esotropes than exotropes; however, these differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05 for all comparisons). Conclusion: Patients with congenital strabismus in this study had lower mean IQ scores than the normal population which may be due to genetic background or acquired causes secondary to strabismus."
23943057,Adding intelligence to mobile asset management in hospitals: the true value of RFID,Linda Castro,"RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology is expected to play a vital role in the healthcare arena, especially in times when cost containments are at the top of the priorities of healthcare management authorities. Medical equipment represents a significant share of yearly healthcare operational costs; hence, ensuring an effective and efficient management of such key assets is critical to promptly and reliably deliver a diversity of clinical services at the patient bedside. Empirical evidence from a phased-out RFID implementation in one European hospital demonstrates that RFID has the potential to transform asset management by improving inventory management, enhancing asset utilization, increasing staff productivity, improving care services, enhancing maintenance compliance, and increasing information visibility. Most importantly, RFID allows the emergence of intelligent asset management processes, which is, undoubtedly, the most important benefit that could be derived from the RFID system. Results show that the added intelligence can be rather basic (auto-status change) or a bit more advanced (personalized automatic triggers). More importantly, adding intelligence improves planning and decision-making processes."
23940233,The collective origins of valued originality: a social identity approach to creativity,S Alexander Haslam,"Prevailing approaches to individual and group creativity have focused on personal factors that contribute to creative behavior (e.g., personality, intelligence, motivation), and the processes of behaving creatively and appreciating creativity are understood to be largely unrelated. This article uses social identity and self-categorization theories as the basis for a model of creativity that addresses these lacunae by emphasizing the role that groups play in stimulating and shaping creative acts and in determining the reception they are given. We argue that shared social identity (or lack of it) motivates individuals to rise to particular creative challenges and provides a basis for certain forms of creativity to be recognized (or disregarded). Empirical work informed by this approach supports eight novel hypotheses relating to individual, group, and systemic dimensions of the creativity process. These also provide an agenda for future creativity research."
23939558,Assessing activities of daily living in patients with epilepsy],C Helmstaedter,"Background: Objective cognitive assessment and subjective self-assessment do not sufficiently reflect actual daily routines and everyday functioning of patients with epilepsy. The study at hand examined whether a questionnaire assessing the activities of daily living provides additional diagnostic information. Methods: A total of 180 consecutive patients with epilepsy received a questionnaire addressing (i) mood, (ii) subjective cognitive performance as well as (iii) frequencies of subjective problems in everyday life and (iv) 36 activities of daily living (ADL-Track). Normative data were based on 536 healthy volunteers. Analysis focused on the interrelation among these subjective measures as well as their relation to objective neuropsychological performance. Results: Compared to the normative sample, social activities, home activities, and mobility were reduced in 25 - 34 % of the patients (OR = 2.07 - 2.79). Frequencies of activities of daily living reflect the results of subjective performance ratings (""attention"", ""praxia"") and objective performance in attention, language, intelligence and memory. A negative mood showed highly significant correlations with subjective complaints and increased the risk of reduced activities by a factor of 2 - 3. Multiple regression analyses explained between 9 - 22 % of the variance of the ADL-Track scales. Conclusion: The ADL-Track, a questionnaire on frequencies of activities of daily living, appears more independent from mood than subjective complaints and it shows relevant correlations with subjective and even more with objective cognitive measures. Moreover, it indicates a behavioural domain in epilepsy which is not yet covered by standard diagnostics. When applied longitudinally, the ADL-Track may well turn out to be a valuable longer-term outcome parameter with regard to epilepsy and its treatment."
23939033,Validation of a screening tool for attention and executive functions (EpiTrack Junior) in children and adolescents with absence epilepsy,Navah Ester Kadish,"Objective: Our prospective study aimed at the validation of EpiTrack Junior, a neuropsychological screening tool for attention and executive functions in children with epilepsy. Methods: Twenty-two children with absence epilepsy aged 8-17 years underwent comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation including EpiTrack Junior and measures of intelligence, verbal and nonverbal memory, word fluency and visuoconstructive organization. Concurrent and discriminant validity of EpiTrack Junior subtests and total score as well as sensitivity and specificity of the total score were analyzed. Results: EpiTrack Junior total score was impaired in 59% of participants. Concurrent validity was demonstrated in 4/6 subtests and for the total score. Discriminant validity was shown with respect to verbal and nonverbal long-term memory. Sensitivity was higher than specificity and highest for the ""working memory index"". Conclusion: EpiTrack Junior is recommended as a sensitive and time-efficient screening tool for attention and executive functions in children with epilepsy. Impaired results should be followed up with detailed evaluation including information from the parents and school as well as counseling where indicated."
23937609,A call to standardize preanalytic data elements for biospecimens,James A Robb,"Context: Biospecimens must have appropriate clinical annotation (data) to ensure optimal quality for both patient care and research. Clinical preanalytic variables are the focus of this study. Objective: To define the essential preanalytic variables (data fields) that should be attached to every collected biospecimen and to provide a complete list of such variables, along with their relative importance, which can vary, depending on downstream use, institutional needs, and information technology capabilities. Design: The College of American Pathologists Diagnostic Intelligence and Health Information Technology Committee sponsored a Biorepository Working Group to develop a ranked list of the preanalytic variables for annotating biospecimens. Members of the working group were experts in anatomic, clinical, and molecular pathology; biobanking; medical informatics; and accreditation. Several members had experience with federal government programs, such as the National Cancer Institute's Biospecimens and Biorepository Branch and the National Cancer Institute's Community Cancer Center Program. Potential preanalytic variables were identified and ranked along with available supporting evidence, definitions, and potential negative effects if the variable was not attached to the biospecimen. Additional national and international stakeholders reviewed the draft manuscript. Results: The ranked listing of 170 preanalytic variables produced can be used as a guide for site-specific implementation into patient care and/or research biorepository processes. Conclusions.-In our collective experience, it is often difficult to choose which of the many preanalytic variables to attach to any specific set of biospecimens used for patient care and/or research. The provided ranked list should aid in the selection of preanalytic variables for a given biospecimen collection."
23937534,How well is psychometric g indexed by global composites? Evidence from three popular intelligence tests,Matthew R Reynolds,"Global composites (e.g., IQs) calculated in intelligence tests are interpreted as indexes of the general factor of intelligence, or psychometric g. It is therefore important to understand the proportion of variance in those global composites that is explained by g. In this study, we calculated this value, referred to as hierarchical omega, using large-scale, nationally representative norming sample data from 3 popular individually administered tests of intelligence for children and adolescents. We also calculated the proportion of variance explained in the global composites by g and the group factors, referred to as omega total, or composite reliability, for comparison purposes. Within each battery, g was measured equally well. Using total sample data, we found that 82%-83% of the total test score variance was explained by g. The group factors were also measured in the global composites, with both g and group factors explaining 89%-91% of the total test score variance for the total samples. Global composites are primarily indexes of g, but the group factors, as a whole, also explain a meaningful amount of variance."
23937239,"Neurodevelopmental outcome, psychological adjustment, and quality of life in adolescents with congenital heart disease",Christina Schaefer,"Aim: The aim of this study was to examine neurodevelopment, psychological adjustment, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adolescents after bypass surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD) during early childhood. Method: Fifty-nine adolescents (34 females, 25 males) with CHD were examined at a median age of 13 years 8 months (range 11 y 5 mo-16 y 11 mo). Outcome was assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, (fourth edition); the Beery Test of Visual-Motor Integration; the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test; the Zurich Neuromotor Assessment; the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; and the KIDSCREEN questionnaires. Results were compared with those of 40 age- and sex-matched healthy comparison individuals. Results: Outcome with regard to full-scale IQ, perceptual reasoning, and the working memory scale was poorer in patients with CHD than in the comparison group (all p ≤ 0.001). Visual perception, visuomotor integration (p ≤ 0.001), and executive functions (Rey figure copy: p=0.05) were also affected. Patients with CHD also had lower scores on all motor domains (p < 0.02) except static balance. Psychological adjustment was affected only in the 'peer relationship' domain (p=0.05). Quality of life was similar to that of typically developing peers. Interpretation: Adolescents with CHD may manifest persistent cognitive and motor impairments, while psychological adjustment and self-reported HRQoL are mostly typical. Thus, long-term neurodevelopmental evaluations are necessary to provide early educational and therapeutic support."
23936251,Physical predictors of cognitive performance in healthy older adults: a cross-sectional analysis,Christiaan G Blankevoort,"There is ample evidence that physical and cognitive performance are related, but the results of studies investigating this relationship show great variability. Both physical performance and cognitive performance are constructs consisting of several subdomains, but it is presently unknown if the relationship between physical and cognitive performance depends on subdomain of either construct and whether gender and age moderate this relationship. The aim of this study is to identify the strongest physical predictors of cognitive performance, to determine the specificity of these predictors for various cognitive subdomains, and to examine gender and age as potential moderators of the relationship between physical and cognitive performance in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. In total, 98 men and 122 women (average age 74.0±5.6 years) were subjected to a series of performance-based physical fitness and neuropsychological tests. Muscle strength, balance, functional reach, and walking ability (combined score of walking speed and endurance) were considered to predict cognitive performance across several domains (i.e. memory, verbal attention, visual attention, set-shifting, visuo-motor attention, inhibition and intelligence). Results showed that muscle strength was a significant predictor of cognitive performance for men and women. Walking ability and balance were significant predictors of cognitive performance for men, whereas only walking ability was significant for women. We did not find a moderating effect of age, nor did we find support for a differential effect of the physical predictors across different cognitive subdomains. In summary, our results showed a significant relationship between cognitive and physical performance, with a moderating effect of gender."
23936154,Developmental gains in visuospatial memory predict gains in mathematics achievement,Yaoran Li,"Visuospatial competencies are related to performance in mathematical domains in adulthood, but are not consistently related to mathematics achievement in children. We confirmed the latter for first graders and demonstrated that children who show above average first-to-fifth grade gains in visuospatial memory have an advantage over other children in mathematics. The study involved the assessment of the mathematics and reading achievement of 177 children in kindergarten to fifth grade, inclusive, and their working memory capacity and processing speed in first and fifth grade. Intelligence was assessed in first grade and their second to fourth grade teachers reported on their in-class attentive behavior. Developmental gains in visuospatial memory span (d = 2.4) were larger than gains in the capacity of the central executive (d = 1.6) that in turn were larger than gains in phonological memory span (d = 1.1). First to fifth grade gains in visuospatial memory and in speed of numeral processing predicted end of fifth grade mathematics achievement, as did first grade central executive scores, intelligence, and in-class attentive behavior. The results suggest there are important individual differences in the rate of growth of visuospatial memory during childhood and that these differences become increasingly important for mathematics learning."
23935416,An improved marriage in honey bees optimization algorithm for single objective unconstrained optimization,Yuksel Celik,Marriage in honey bees optimization (MBO) is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm developed by inspiration of the mating and fertilization process of honey bees and is a kind of swarm intelligence optimizations. In this study we propose improved marriage in honey bees optimization (IMBO) by adding Levy flight algorithm for queen mating flight and neighboring for worker drone improving. The IMBO algorithm's performance and its success are tested on the well-known six unconstrained test functions and compared with other metaheuristic optimization algorithms.
23933621,Associations of prenatal mercury exposure from maternal fish consumption and polyunsaturated fatty acids with child neurodevelopment: a prospective cohort study in Italy,Francesca Valent,"Background: Mercury is a neurotoxin, and limited prenatal exposure to it can affect long-term child neurodevelopment. However, results of epidemiologic studies of such exposure have been inconsistent. We examined the association of prenatal mercury exposure from maternal fish consumption with child neurodevelopment in northern Italy. Methods: A population-based cohort of 606 children and their mothers was studied from pregnancy to age 18 months. Mercury levels were measured in maternal hair and blood during pregnancy and in umbilical cord blood and breast milk. Levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were measured in maternal serum. Maternal and child intakes of fish were assessed by using a food frequency questionnaire. The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III) was used to evaluate child neurodevelopment. Multivariate linear regression was used to examine the association of mercury exposure with BSID-III scores, after controlling for maternal fish intake, PUFAs during pregnancy, and several other confounders. Results: Mean weekly fish intake during pregnancy was less than 2 servings. Mercury concentrations in biological samples were low (mean, 1061 ng/g in hair) and moderately correlated with fish intake, particularly of carnivorous species. Maternal ω-3 PUFA concentrations were poorly correlated with fish intake. Maternal intelligence quotient (IQ) and child intake of fish were significantly associated with neurodevelopment scores. In multivariate models, the level of Hg exposure was not associated with neurodevelopmental performance at 18 months. Conclusions: In this Italian population, neurodevelopment at 18 months was associated with child intake of fresh fish and maternal IQ rather than with mercury exposure. The expected beneficial effect of maternal fish intake (from maternal ω-3 PUFAs) was not found."
23933215,"Body mass index, but not FTO genotype or major depressive disorder, influences brain structure",J H Cole,"Obesity and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly prevalent and often comorbid health conditions. Both are associated with differences in brain structure and are genetically influenced. Yet, little is known about how obesity, MDD, and known risk genotypes might interact in the brain. Subjects were 81 patients with MDD (mean age 48.6 years) and 69 matched healthy controls (mean age 51.2 years). Subjects underwent 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging, genotyping for the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene rs3751812 polymorphism, and measurements for body mass index (BMI). We conducted a whole brain voxelwise analysis using tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to examine the main and interaction effects of diagnosis, BMI and FTO genotype. Significant effects of BMI were observed across widespread brain regions, indicating reductions in predominantly subcortical and white matter areas associated with increased BMI, but there was no influence of MDD or FTO rs3751812 genotype. There were no significant interaction effects. Within MDD patients, there was no effect of current depressive symptoms; however the use of antidepressant medication was associated with reductions in brain volume in the frontal lobe and cerebellum. Obesity affects brain structure in both healthy participants and MDD patients; this influence may account for some of the brain changes previously associated with MDD. BMI and the use of medication should ideally be measured and controlled for when conducting structural brain imaging research in MDD."
23932993,School and cognitive functioning problems in adolescent bariatric surgery candidates,Eve Khlyavich Freidl,"Background: Prior studies have reported that students with overweight and obesity have impairments in performance IQ and executive function and worse school functioning in comparison with peers of normal weight. The present study assessed school and cognitive functioning in a sample of adolescents with severe obesity being evaluated for laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Methods: Eligible candidates for bariatric surgery were referred for psychiatric evaluation, which included a semistructured clinical interview measuring school functioning and the vocabulary and matrix reasoning subtests of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). Results: Self-reported school problems were common, with 55.5% of adolescents failing a grade or subject, 38.7% attending summer school, and 17.8% failing a citywide examination. A significant relationship was observed between body mass index, estimated WASI IQ (r = -.250; P = .005), and the vocabulary subtest (r = -.241; P = .006), but not matrix reasoning (r = -.126; P = NS). Conclusion: Even among a sample of adolescents with severe obesity, increased body mass index was associated with lower WASI IQ and vocabulary subtest scores. Increasing awareness of potential cognitive and school problems in bariatric candidates among teachers, school counselors, and other mental health providers is an important first step to improving academic support and educational systems deficiencies for students with overweight and obesity."
23932608,Growth and developmental outcomes of infants with gastroschisis at one year of age: a retrospective study,Corrado Minutillo,"Background: The aim of the study was to describe the physical growth and developmental outcomes of babies born with gastroschisis. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all cases of gastroschisis in Western Australia born between 1997 and 2010. Results: In the 128 pregnancies with fetal gastroschisis, 117 babies were live born. 112 (95.7%) survived to one year. 19% had z scores of<-1.28 for weight at birth (<10th centiles) compared with 30% at one year. Neurodevelopmental data were available in 88/112 (79%) of survivors (Griffiths scores in 67; reports of ages and stages questionnaire (ASQ) in 21). The mean GQ at 12 months was 99 (SD 9.8). Suboptimal neurodevelopmental outcomes were noted in eight. Complex gastroschisis (present at birth) and acquired gut related complications were associated with adverse long term outcomes. The incidence of acquired gut complications was least (5%) in those who underwent silo reduction as the primary management. However, on univariate and multivariate analysis, the type of primary reduction did not significantly influence the outcome. Conclusions: A large proportion of infants with gastroschisis exhibit suboptimal weight gain during the first year. The incidence of adverse developmental outcomes appears to be low."
23932607,Early childhood outcomes of infants born with gastroschisis,Michael van Manen,"Purpose: To describe neonatal and childhood outcomes of a contemporary cohort of infants with gastroschisis. Methods: Observational, single center, inception cohort of children born with gastroschisis from January 2005 to December 2008. Results: Of 63 infants, 61 survived to hospital discharge and 39 were seen for follow-up. Complications included sepsis (37%), necrotizing enterocolitis (10%), parenteral nutrition related cholestasis (25%), and short bowel syndrome (13%). Of survivors, 5% had visual impairment and 10% had hearing loss. No child tested had mental delay or cerebral palsy. Early gestational age predicted death or disability (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38, 0.96; p=0.033). There was a high incidence of prescription medications for presumed gastroesophageal reflux (90%). Some infants continued to require tube feeds (15%). There were improvements in longitudinal growth reflected in increasing z-scores. Conclusions: Although children with gastroschisis are at risk for disability, childhood outcomes are encouraging."
23932385,Design of fuzzy classifier for diabetes disease using Modified Artificial Bee Colony algorithm,Fayssal Beloufa,"In this study, diagnosis of diabetes disease, which is one of the most important diseases, is conducted with artificial intelligence techniques. We have proposed a novel Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm in which a mutation operator is added to an Artificial Bee Colony for improving its performance. When the current best solution cannot be updated, a blended crossover operator (BLX-α) of genetic algorithm is applied, in order to enhance the diversity of ABC, without compromising with the solution quality. This modified version of ABC is used as a new tool to create and optimize automatically the membership functions and rules base directly from data. We take the diabetes dataset used in our work from the UCI machine learning repository. The performances of the proposed method are evaluated through classification rate, sensitivity and specificity values using 10-fold cross-validation method. The obtained classification rate of our method is 84.21% and it is very promising when compared with the previous research in the literature for the same problem."
23931705,Neural substrates of behavioral variability in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: based on ex-Gaussian reaction time distribution and diffusion spectrum imaging tractography,H-Y Lin,"Background: Increased intra-individual variability (IIV) in reaction time (RT) across various tasks is one ubiquitous neuropsychological finding in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, neurobiological underpinnings of IIV in individuals with ADHD have not yet been fully delineated. The ex-Gaussian distribution has been proved to capture IIV in RT. The authors explored the three parameters [μ (mu), σ (sigma), τ (tau)] of an ex-Gaussian RT distribution derived from the Conners' continuous performance test (CCPT) and their correlations with the microstructural integrity of the frontostriatal-caudate tracts and the cingulum bundles. Method: We assessed 28 youths with ADHD (8-17 years; 25 males) and 28 age-, sex-, IQ- and handedness-matched typically developing (TD) youths using the CCPT, Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 3rd edition and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Microstructural integrity, indexed by generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA), was measured by diffusion spectrum imaging tractrography on a 3-T MRI system. Results: Youths with ADHD had larger σ (s.d. of Gaussian distribution) and τ (mean of exponential distribution) and reduced GFA in four bilateral frontostriatal tracts. With increased inter-stimulus intervals of CCPT, the magnitude of greater τ in ADHD than TD increased. In ADHD youths, the cingulum bundles and frontostriatal integrity were associated with three ex-Gaussian parameters and with μ (mean of Gaussian distribution) and τ, respectively; while only frontostriatal GFA was associated with μ and τ in TD youths. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the crucial role of the integrity of the cingulum bundles in accounting for IIV in ADHD. Involvement of different brain systems in mediating IIV may relate to a distinctive pathophysiological processing and/or adaptive compensatory mechanism."
23931579,Executive functioning in individuals with intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders,R L Roelofs,"Background: Executive functioning (EF) is important for adequate behavioural functioning and crucial for explaining symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in individuals with normal intelligence, but is scarcely studied in individuals with ASD and intellectual disabilities (ID). We therefore study EF in an ID population by comparing performances on three frequently studied executive functions (shifting, inhibition and updating) between individuals with ASD and individuals without ASD. When studying ID populations, one should be aware of Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns (SLODR), as it questions the possibility of measuring separate cognitive functions in ID populations. Methods: Six EF tasks were administered to 50 individuals with mild to borderline ID, of which half was diagnosed with ASD. In order to investigate the distinctness of the three executive functions in this ID sample, the results on the six EF tasks were subjected to principal components analysis (PCA). Subsequently, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed to assess differences between the ASD and non-ASD group on shifting, inhibition and updating. Results: The PCA revealed the hypothesised EF trichotomy. MANOVA analysis showed no significant group differences on EF-performance. Conclusions: Three separate executive functions were measured in this ID population, but despite much evidence that individuals with ASD display more behavioural problems and the proven relevance of EF in behavioural functioning, no significant group difference was found on shifting, inhibition or updating. After this first effort to achieve more insight into EF of individuals with ASD and ID the relation between behavioural problems and EF will require further study."
23930987,Everyday music listening and affect regulation: the role of MP3 players,Marie Strand Skånland,"The use of digital portable music devices such as MP3 players has rapidly increased during the last decade, and the sheer availability of music offered by such players raises questions about their impact on listeners' mental and physical health and well-being. This article explores MP3 player use as an everyday tactic for affect regulation, here understood as an individual's efforts to maintain or change the intensity or duration of a given affect. The ability to understand and regulate affects has significant health implications, and among the tactics relevant to such regulation, engagement with music has proven to be particularly successful. The material presented in this article is based on a qualitative interview study focused on MP3 player use as a medium for musical self-care. Because MP3 users can listen to whatever they want, whenever they want, and target their music in the interests of managing and regulating moods and emotions, the MP3 player represents a valuable and convenient technology of affect regulation."
23930538,"C. H. McCloy Lecture: symbols, conventions, games, Eleanor Metheny, and the evolution of human intelligence",Scott Kretchmar,"In this essay I argue that Eleanor Metheny was ahead of her time when she argued that nonverbal physical activities carry symbolic meanings and are, for that reason and others, intellectually impressive. I compare her theories on the symbolic process with something that might be called the ""conventional process."" I will show why conventional logic rather than symbolic reasoning tells us more about the way intelligence evolved and the potentially impressive role played by games in the advance of human civilization."
23930505,Forensic psychiatric cases of 534 mental disorders caused by traumatic brain injury],Ting Li,"Objective: To analyze the types of mental disorders caused by traumatic brain injury and the optimal time for forensic psychiatric appraisal. To explore the relationship between the degree of traumatic brain injury, the time of appraisal and the grade of intellectual deficiency. Methods: Five hundred and thirty-four forensic psychiatric cases of mental disorders caused by traumatic brain injury were retrospectively analyzed. Results: In the types of mental disorders caused by traumatic brain injury, the most cases were diagnosed as organic mood disorders (51.1%), following organic neurosis-like syndrome (24.0%) and organic intellectual deficiency (18.0%). For the disability grades, the most cases were the level VIII and IX disability grades, 219 cases (41.0%) and 177 cases (33.1%), respectively. The degree of brain injury and the degree of intelligence defection according to WAIS-RC were higher in intellectual deficiency group compared with non-intellectual deficiency group (P < 0.05). The grade of disability correlated with the degree of brain injury, the result of WAIS-RC, the result of cerebral CT scanning, and the grade of brain electrical activity mapping (BEAM) abnormality (P < 0.05). Nevertheless, the degree of intellectual deficiency did not correlate with appraisal time and the degree of brain injury (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The factors influencing intellectual deficiency are complex. The findings of objective examination including cerebral CT scanning, BEAM, WAIS-RC and others should be considered as important indexes for disability evaluation."
23929980,Social influence bias: a randomized experiment,Lev Muchnik,"Our society is increasingly relying on the digitized, aggregated opinions of others to make decisions. We therefore designed and analyzed a large-scale randomized experiment on a social news aggregation Web site to investigate whether knowledge of such aggregates distorts decision-making. Prior ratings created significant bias in individual rating behavior, and positive and negative social influences created asymmetric herding effects. Whereas negative social influence inspired users to correct manipulated ratings, positive social influence increased the likelihood of positive ratings by 32% and created accumulating positive herding that increased final ratings by 25% on average. This positive herding was topic-dependent and affected by whether individuals were viewing the opinions of friends or enemies. A mixture of changing opinion and greater turnout under both manipulations together with a natural tendency to up-vote on the site combined to create the herding effects. Such findings will help interpret collective judgment accurately and avoid social influence bias in collective intelligence in the future."
23929050,Origins of the physical profile,Sanders Marble,"This article examines how the U.S. Army came to adopt the physical profile. In 1945, the Army adopted the physical profile system that has, with some changes, survived to this day. Although the profile system does not always work smoothly, it replaced a system that was failing completely to deliver physically fit men to combat units. The World War II problems were the outgrowth of two World War I systems that had been adopted to speed mobilization by (1) accepting physically substandard men and (2) matching men to a noncombat job by their skills. By simply identifying a soldier as ""General Service"" or ""Limited Service"" it did not provide enough information about his limitations. In addition, the Army used an intelligence test to grade manpower, but because it lacked information on a man's physical abilities/limitations, that data were misused to allot manpower. These policies interacted with a societal disdain for the ""handicapped"" and ""substandard"" and made it hard to use Limited Service men. Adding detail to the information on physical abilities was the Army's solution."
23927979,"ADHD-related symptoms, emotional/behavioral problems, and physical conditions in Taiwanese children with epilepsy",Fang-Ju Tsai,"Background/purpose: Little is known about whether Asian children with epilepsy have more attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-related symptoms, emotional/ behavioral problems, and physical conditions compared with those described in Western studies. The authors investigated the rates of ADHD-related symptoms, emotional/behavioral problems, and physical conditions among pediatric patients with epilepsy. Methods: We recruited 61 patients with epilepsy, aged 6-16 years, and 122 age-, sex-, and parental education-matched school controls. Data on demographics, parental reports on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham, version IV scale (SNAP-IV), and medical records were collected. Results: The average full-scale intelligence quotient of the case group was 95.8. There were 11 (18.0%), 7 (11.5%), 26 (42.6%), and 26 (42.6%) of children with epilepsy ever clinically diagnosed with developmental delay, overt ADHD symptoms, allergies reported by physicians, and behavior problems measured by the CBCL, respectively. Those children with epilepsy had more severe ADHD-related symptoms and a wider range of emotional/behavioral problems than controls (Cohen's d 0.36-0.80). The rate of potential cases of ADHD among children with epilepsy was 24.6%. A history of developmental delay predicted ADHD- related symptoms and internalizing and externalizing problems. Among children with epilepsy, a longer duration of treatment with antiepileptic drugs predicted externalizing problems, and an earlier onset of epilepsy predicted inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Conclusion: Our findings imply that clinicians should assess physical and emotional/behavioral problems among children with epilepsy in order to provide interventions to offset possible adverse psychiatric outcomes."
23927834,On the spatial dynamics and oscillatory behavior of a predator-prey model based on cellular automata and local particle swarm optimization,Mario Martínez Molina,"A two-dimensional lattice model based on Cellular Automata theory and swarm intelligence is used to study the spatial and population dynamics of a theoretical ecosystem. It is found that the social interactions among predators provoke the formation of clusters, and that by increasing the mobility of predators the model enters into an oscillatory behavior."
23927531,Measuring governance at health facility level: developing and validation of simple governance tool in Zambia,Wilbroad Mutale,"Background: Governance has been cited as a key determinant of economic growth, social advancement and overall development. Achievement of millennium development goals is partly dependant on governance practices. In 2007, Health Systems 20/20 conducted an Internet-based survey on the practice of good governance. The survey posed a set of good practices related to health governance and asked respondents to indicate whether their experience confirmed or disconfirmed those practices. We applied the 17 governance statements in rural health facilities of Zambia. The aim was to establish whether the statements were reliable and valid for assessing governance practices at primary care level. Methods: Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. We first applied the governance statements developed by the health system 20/20 and then conducted focus group discussion and In-depth interviews to explore some elements of governance including accountability and community participation. The target respondents were the health facility management team and community members. The sample size include 42 health facilities. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 17 and Nvivo version 9. Results: The 95% one-sided confidence interval for Cronbach's alpha was between 0.69 and 0.74 for the 16 items.The mean score for most of the items was above 3. Factor analysis yielded five principle components: Transparency, community participation, Intelligence & vision, Accountability and Regulation & oversight. Most of the items (6) clustered around the transparency latent factor. Chongwe district performed poorly in overall mean governance score and across the five domains of governance. The overall scores in Chongwe ranged between 51 and 94% with the mean of 80%. Kafue and Luangwa districts had similar overall mean governance scores (88%). Community participation was generally low. Generally, it was noted that community members lacked capacity to hold health workers accountable for drugs and medical supplies. Conclusions: The study successfully validated and applied the new tool for evaluating health system governance at health facility level. The results have shown that it is feasible to measure governance practices at health facility level and that the adapted tool is fairly reliable with the 95% one-sided confidence interval for Cronbach's alpha laying between 0.69 and 0.74 for the 16 items. Caution should be taken when interpreting overall scores as they tended to mask domain specific variations."
23927508,Assessment of genetic and nongenetic interactions for the prediction of depressive symptomatology: an analysis of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study using machine learning algorithms,Nicholas S Roetker,"Objectives: We examined depression within a multidimensional framework consisting of genetic, environmental, and sociobehavioral factors and, using machine learning algorithms, explored interactions among these factors that might better explain the etiology of depressive symptoms. Methods: We measured current depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (n = 6378 participants in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study). Genetic factors were 78 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); environmental factors-13 stressful life events (SLEs), plus a composite proportion of SLEs index; and sociobehavioral factors-18 personality, intelligence, and other health or behavioral measures. We performed traditional SNP associations via logistic regression likelihood ratio testing and explored interactions with support vector machines and Bayesian networks. Results: After correction for multiple testing, we found no significant single genotypic associations with depressive symptoms. Machine learning algorithms showed no evidence of interactions. Naïve Bayes produced the best models in both subsets and included only environmental and sociobehavioral factors. Conclusions: We found no single or interactive associations with genetic factors and depressive symptoms. Various environmental and sociobehavioral factors were more predictive of depressive symptoms, yet their impacts were independent of one another. A genome-wide analysis of genetic alterations using machine learning methodologies will provide a framework for identifying genetic-environmental-sociobehavioral interactions in depressive symptoms."
23924061,Similarities and differences of emotions in human-machine and human-human interactions: what kind of emotions are relevant for future companion systems?,Steffen Walter,"Cognitive-technical intelligence is envisioned to be constantly available and capable of adapting to the user's emotions. However, the question is: what specific emotions should be reliably recognised by intelligent systems? Hence, in this study, we have attempted to identify similarities and differences of emotions between human-human (HHI) and human-machine interactions (HMI). We focused on what emotions in the experienced scenarios of HMI are retroactively reflected as compared with HHI. The sample consisted of N = 145 participants, who were divided into two groups. Positive and negative scenario descriptions of HMI and HHI were given by the first and second groups, respectively. Subsequently, the participants evaluated their respective scenarios with the help of 94 adjectives relating to emotions. The correlations between the occurrences of emotions in the HMI versus HHI were very high. The results do not support the statement that only a few emotions in HMI are relevant."
23923980,Tactical proficiency among table tennis players with and without intellectual disabilities,Debbie Van Biesen,"The effect of intellectual impairment on sports performance has received limited attention by researchers. As a contribution to closing this gap, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the differences in tactical proficiency between table tennis players with and without intellectual disabilities (ID). These groups were matched for training-volume and experience and consisted of 41 male (age = 27±8) and 30 female (age= 28±8) elite players with ID and a reference group of 12 male (age= 24±12) and 5 female (age= 20±9) players without ID. In two different test settings - one a World Championship and the other a training camp - the players in each group performed 60 semi-standardised rallies against the same opponent. Players were told that 12 sets of five identical services would be delivered, and their goal was to return the service with the intention of 'winning the point'. The test results were validated for this study, to compute tactical proficiency scores (maximal score of eight points) for each player. A two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed significantly lower proficiency scores for players with ID than for those without ID. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that within each series of five rallies, starting with identical services, all participants were able to significantly improve their tactical proficiency gradually, but players without ID scored 4.3±0.5 from the first ball on, and while athletes with ID only 3.3±0.7 after five balls. The results of this study indicate that ID is associated with decreased tactical proficiency in table tennis."
23922813,Presence and significant determinants of cognitive impairment in a large sample of patients with multiple sclerosis,Martina Borghi,"Objectives: To investigate the presence and the nature of cognitive impairment in a large sample of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and to identify clinical and demographic determinants of cognitive impairment in MS. Methods: 303 patients with MS and 279 healthy controls were administered the Brief Repeatable Battery of Neuropsychological tests (BRB-N); measures of pre-morbid verbal competence and neuropsychiatric measures were also administered. Results: Patients and healthy controls were matched for age, gender, education and pre-morbid verbal Intelligence Quotient. Patients presenting with cognitive impairment were 108/303 (35.6%). In the overall group of participants, the significant predictors of the most sensitive BRB-N scores were: presence of MS, age, education, and Vocabulary. The significant predictors when considering MS patients only were: course of MS, age, education, vocabulary, and depression. Using logistic regression analyses, significant determinants of the presence of cognitive impairment in relapsing-remitting MS patients were: duration of illness (OR = 1.053, 95% CI = 1.010-1.097, p = 0.015), Expanded Disability Status Scale score (OR = 1.247, 95% CI = 1.024-1.517, p = 0.028), and vocabulary (OR = 0.960, 95% CI = 0.936-0.984, p = 0.001), while in the smaller group of progressive MS patients these predictors did not play a significant role in determining the cognitive outcome. Conclusions: Our results corroborate the evidence about the presence and the nature of cognitive impairment in a large sample of patients with MS. Furthermore, our findings identify significant clinical and demographic determinants of cognitive impairment in a large sample of MS patients for the first time. Implications for further research and clinical practice were discussed."
23921675,The relation between intelligence and religiosity: a meta-analysis and some proposed explanations,Miron Zuckerman,"A meta-analysis of 63 studies showed a significant negative association between intelligence and religiosity. The association was stronger for college students and the general population than for participants younger than college age; it was also stronger for religious beliefs than religious behavior. For college students and the general population, means of weighted and unweighted correlations between intelligence and the strength of religious beliefs ranged from -.20 to -.25 (mean r = -.24). Three possible interpretations were discussed. First, intelligent people are less likely to conform and, thus, are more likely to resist religious dogma. Second, intelligent people tend to adopt an analytic (as opposed to intuitive) thinking style, which has been shown to undermine religious beliefs. Third, several functions of religiosity, including compensatory control, self-regulation, self-enhancement, and secure attachment, are also conferred by intelligence. Intelligent people may therefore have less need for religious beliefs and practices."
23920532,An ontological approach for the exploitation of clinical data,Ariane Assélé Kama,"Clinical data captured in hospital information systems may be unusable in their original format due to missing information or knowledge. The use of external resources (e.g. domain ontology) could be a way of dealing with this lack of knowledge. Our study thus aimed to develop a framework allowing a user to perform medical queries in the context of infectious diseases. By creating an interaction between a knowledge source and clinical data, using semantic and semantic web tools and methods, the users are able to perform queries on a database to obtain results about antibiotic resistance. This work has been performed in the context of the DebugIT European project that aims to control and monitor the antibioresistance growth via a semantic interoperability platform. The results obtained by the use of different semantic web tools were quantitatively evaluated by comparison of the number of results and the query execution time. We have compared our approach with classic business intelligence approaches in terms of usability and functionality."
23920451,From intensive care monitoring to personal health monitoring to ambient intelligence,Otto Rienhoff,"The historical roots of IT-based monitoring in health care are described. Since the 1970ies monitoring has been spreading to more and more domains of health care and public health. Today one can observe monitoring of persons in many environments and regarding widely different questions. While these monitoring applications have been introduced ethical questions have been raised to balance the possible positive and negative outcomes of the approaches. Today IT-technology is entering many parts of our life - IT eventually became what had been coined already in the last century by IBM as ""electronic dust"" which one can find in every part of our environment. As most of these ""dust-particles"" are able to observe something one can also understand this development as a development into ubiquitous monitoring of nearly everything at any time. The foreseen ambient intelligence worlds are also spaces of ambient monitoring. This article describes this historical development. It emphasizes why ethical and data protection questions are an absolute must in most IT activities today."
23920057,The diminished interhemispheric connectivity correlates with negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in first-episode schizophrenia,Tumbwene E Mwansisya,"Background: Previous studies imply that interhemispheric disconnectivity plays a more important role on information processing in schizophrenia. However, the role of the aberrant interhemispheric connection in the pathophysiology of this disorder remains unclear. Recently, resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has reported to have potentials of mapping functional interactions between pairs of brain hemispheres. Methods: Resting-state whole-brain functional connectivity analyses were performed on 41 schizophrenia patients and 33 healthy controls. Results: The first-episode schizophrenia patients showed significant aberrant interhemispheric connection in the globus pallidus, medial frontal gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus. The correlation of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale scores with odds ratio of the aberrant interhemispheric connections revealed positive correlation in the pallidum (rho=0.335, p=.003) and medial frontal gyrus (rho=0.260, p=.025). The connection in the pallidum was also positively correlated with duration of illness (rho=-0.407, p=.009). Whereas, the aberrant interhemispheric connection in the inferior temporal gyrus was positively correlated with scores of Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (rho=0.393, p=.012). Conclusion: The present study provides fMRI evidence for the aberrant interhemispheric resting-state functional connectivity within resting-state networks in first-episode schizophrenia patients. These aberrant interhemispheric connections, in particular the pallidum, due to its anatomical and functional connectivities, may be the primary disturbance for cognitive impairment, negative symptoms and chronicity of schizophrenia."
23917653,"Cognition, behavior and social competence of preterm low birth weight children at school age",Rachel Gick Fan,"Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the cognitive and behavioral development of preterm and low birth weight newborns living in a disadvantageous socioeconomic environment at school age. Methods: This cross-sectional study included children aged 6-7 from a historical birth cohort of preterm (gestational age <37 weeks) and low birth weight (<2,500 g) infants. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III (WISC-III) was administered by a psychologist while the parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist. The results were compared to the test's reference. The perinatal information and follow-up data were collected from the hospital files. The demographic data were collected from the parents. The current performance was compared with the results from the Denver II and Bayley II tests, which were administered during the first years of life. Results: The total intelligence quotient varied from 70 to 140 (mean 98.7±15.8). The borderline intelligence quotient was observed in 9.3% of the children. The Child Behavior Checklist indicated a predominance of social competence problems (27.8%, CI 19.2 to 37.9) compared with behavioral problems (15.5%, CI 8.9 to 24.2). Both the Child Behavior Checklist domains, such as schooling, social and attention problems, and the cognitive scores were significantly associated with maternal education and family income. The results of the Denver and Bayley tests were associated with the cognitive performance (p<0.001) and the Child Behavior Checklist social profile, including aggressive and externalizing behavior (p<0.001). Conclusions: Our data suggest that even low-risk preterm newborns are at risk for developing disturbances in early school age, such as mild cognitive deficits and behavioral disorders. This risk might increase under unfavorable socioeconomic conditions."
23916419,Imaging-genetics in dyslexia: connecting risk genetic variants to brain neuroimaging and ultimately to reading impairments,John D Eicher,"Dyslexia is a common pediatric disorder that affects 5-17% of schoolchildren in the United States. It is marked by unexpected difficulties in fluent reading despite adequate intelligence, opportunity, and instruction. Classically, neuropsychologists have studied dyslexia using a variety of neurocognitive batteries to gain insight into the specific deficits and impairments in affected children. Since dyslexia is a complex genetic trait with high heritability, analyses conditioned on performance on these neurocognitive batteries have been used to try to identify associated genes. This has led to some successes in identifying contributing genes, although much of the heritability remains unexplained. Additionally, the lack of relevant human brain tissue for analysis and the challenges of modeling a uniquely human trait in animals are barriers to advancing our knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology. In vivo imaging technologies, however, present new opportunities to examine dyslexia and reading skills in a clearly relevant context in human subjects. Recent investigations have started to integrate these imaging data with genetic data in attempts to gain a more complete and complex understanding of reading processes. In addition to bridging the gap from genetic risk variant to a discernible neuroimaging phenotype and ultimately to the clinical impairments in reading performance, the use of neuroimaging phenotypes will reveal novel risk genes and variants. In this article, we briefly discuss the genetic and imaging investigations and take an in-depth look at the recent imaging-genetics investigations of dyslexia."
23915594,"Fully integrated, fully automated generation of short tandem repeat profiles",Eugene Tan,"Background: The generation of short tandem repeat profiles, also referred to as 'DNA typing,' is not currently performed outside the laboratory because the process requires highly skilled technical operators and a controlled laboratory environment and infrastructure with several specialized instruments. The goal of this work was to develop a fully integrated system for the automated generation of short tandem repeat profiles from buccal swab samples, to improve forensic laboratory process flow as well as to enable short tandem repeat profile generation to be performed in police stations and in field-forward military, intelligence, and homeland security settings. Results: An integrated system was developed consisting of an injection-molded microfluidic BioChipSet cassette, a ruggedized instrument, and expert system software. For each of five buccal swabs, the system purifies DNA using guanidinium-based lysis and silica binding, amplifies 15 short tandem repeat loci and the amelogenin locus, electrophoretically separates the resulting amplicons, and generates a profile. No operator processing of the samples is required, and the time from swab insertion to profile generation is 84 minutes. All required reagents are contained within the BioChipSet cassette; these consist of a lyophilized polymerase chain reaction mix and liquids for purification and electrophoretic separation.Profiles obtained from fully automated runs demonstrate that the integrated system generates concordant short tandem repeat profiles. The system exhibits single-base resolution from 100 to greater than 500 bases, with inter-run precision with a standard deviation of ±0.05 - 0.10 bases for most alleles. The reagents are stable for at least 6 months at 22°C, and the instrument has been designed and tested to Military Standard 810F for shock and vibration ruggedization. A nontechnical user can operate the system within or outside the laboratory. Conclusions: The integrated system represents the first generation of a turnkey approach to short tandem repeat profiling and has the potential for use in both the field (for example, police booking stations, the battlefield, borders and ports) and the forensic laboratory."
23915040,Gender differences in implicit self-esteem following a romantic partner's success or failure,Kate A Ratliff,"This research examined the influence of a romantic partner's success or failure on one's own implicit and explicit self-esteem. In Experiment 1, men had lower implicit self-esteem when their partner did well at a ""social intelligence"" task than when their partner did poorly. Women's implicit self-esteem was unaffected by partner performance. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that Dutch men's implicit self-esteem was negatively affected by their romantic partner's success. In Experiment 4, we replicated Experiments 1-3 in both the academic and social domains, and in Experiment 5, we demonstrated that men's implicit self-esteem is negatively influenced by thinking about a romantic partner's success both when the success is relative and when it is not. In sum, men's implicit self-esteem is lower when a partner succeeds than when a partner fails, whereas women's implicit self-esteem is not. These gender differences have important implications for understanding social comparison in romantic relationships."
23914954,Longitudinal assessment of trait emotional intelligence: measurement invariance and construct continuity from late childhood to adolescence,Kateryna V Keefer,"Amid the growing efforts to promote positive youth development, trait emotional intelligence (TEI) has emerged as an important protective factor in the processes of resilience and adaptation. The inclusion of a brief form of the Emotional Quotient Inventory-Youth Version (EQi:YV-Brief) in the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) presents a unique opportunity to study the developmental dynamics of TEI during the transition from childhood to adolescence. However, before drawing any inferences about construct continuity and change, researchers must establish that the EQi:YV-Brief functions equivalently over time. This study tested configural, metric, scalar, and residual measurement invariance of the EQi:YV-Brief over a 6-year period from late childhood (age 10-11) to adolescence (age 16-17). Longitudinal mean and covariance structures models were fitted to the data from 773 NLSCY participants (51% girls) who completed the EQi:YV-Brief at 4 biennial cycles. Three of the 4 EQi:YV-Brief subscales were found to be fully invariant at ages 12-13 through 17-18 and partially invariant at age 10-11. Controlling for partial noninvariance, we also investigated patterns of rank-order stability and mean-level change in TEI. These exploratory analyses showed that individual differences in TEI became increasingly more stable with age and that changes in mean TEI levels followed a complex nonlinear pattern over time. The results supported the longitudinal utility of 3 of the 4 EQi:YV-Brief subscales used in the NLSCY, supporting their further use in research on the developmental dynamics of TEI."
23914847,Aims of teachers' psychometry: intelligence testing in Barcelona (1920),Annette Mülberger,"After World War I, members of the teaching profession in Spain were interested in appropriating psychological measurement and bringing it within the expertise of their occupational field, with the intention of upgrading their profession. As professionals devoted to the child, educators attempted to explore the infantile psyche using intelligence tests, with the intention of making scientific contributions to the field of psychology. In the present article we take as a key event one particular application enacted by a Catalan teacher, and insert that case study into the complex local scientific and educational context. It was a context in which the professional interests of teachers competed with those of school physicians, psychologists, and pedologists, at a time when important changes in pedagogical methods and school systems were under way. In the hand of teachers, intelligence testing was mainly seen as a malleable method on which to base daily educational practice on a more individualized and scientific basis. The historical analysis of the case turned out to be instrumental in the identification of common features and particularities attributable to specific local needs. In a society where public schooling competed with private schools, the results of mental testing were used to demonstrate publicly the excellent intellectual level of children attending a public graded primary school in Barcelona.

Partial objectives include analysis of metric characteristics of the measuring instrument, and determining differences between two disciplines (sparring and technical discipline of patterns) and two competition systems (WTF and ITF). In accordance with the aims, the research was conducted on a sample of respondents which consisted of 730 taekwondo instructors from 6 continents and from 69 countries (from which we selected 242 instructors), who are at different success levels in both taekwondo competition systems (styles) and two taekwondo disciplines. The respondents were divided into 3 qualitative subsamples (OST-USP-VRH) using the dependant variable of accomplished results of the instructor. In 6 languages, they electronically evaluated the impact in percentage value (%) of motor and functional skills (MOTFS), morphological characteristics (MORF), psychological profile of an athlete (PSIH), athletic intelligence (INTE) and technical and tactical competence - (TE-TA) on success in taekwondo. The analysis of metric characteristics of the constructed instrument showed a satisfactory degree of agreement (IHr) which is proportional to the level of respondent quality, i.e. it grows along with the increase in instructor quality in all analysed disciplines of both systems. Top instructors assigned the highest portion of impact on success to the motor and functional skills (MOTFS) variable: WTF-SPB=29.1, ITF-SPB=29.2, WTF-THN=35.0, ITF-THN=32.0). Statistically significant differences in opinions of instructors of different styles and disciplines were not recorded in any of the analysed variables. The only exception is the psychological profile of an athlete variable, which WTF instructors of sparring (AM=23.7%), on a significance level of p<0.01, evaluate as having a statistically significantly higher impact on success in tackwondo than WTF instructors of the technical discipline of patterns (15.4%)."
23913782,Subcortical regional morphology correlates with fluid and spatial intelligence,Miguel Burgaleta,"Neuroimaging studies have revealed associations between intelligence and brain morphology. However, researchers have focused primarily on the anatomical features of the cerebral cortex, whereas subcortical structures, such as the basal ganglia (BG), have often been neglected despite extensive functional evidence on their relation with higher-order cognition. Here we performed shape analyses to understand how individual differences in BG local morphology account for variability in cognitive performance. Structural MRI was acquired in 104 young adults (45 men, 59 women, mean age = 19.83, SD = 1.64), and the outer surface of striatal structures (caudate, nucleus accumbens, and putamen), globus pallidus, and thalamus was estimated for each subject and hemisphere. Further, nine cognitive tests were used to measure fluid (Gf), crystallized (Gc), and spatial intelligence (Gv). Latent scores for these factors were computed by means of confirmatory factor analysis and regressed vertex-wise against subcortical shape (local displacements of vertex position), controlling for age, sex, and adjusted for brain size. Significant results (FDR < 5%) were found for Gf and Gv, but not Gc, for the right striatal structures and thalamus. The main results show a relative enlargement of the rostral putamen, which is functionally connected to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and other intelligence-related prefrontal areas."
23913778,Long-term follow-up of four patients with Langer-Giedion syndrome: clinical course and complications,Albert Schinzel,"Long-term observations of individuals with the so-called Langer-Giedion (LGS) or tricho-rhino-phalangeal type II (TRPS2) are scarce. We report here a on follow-up of four LGS individuals, including one first described by Andres Giedion in 1969, and review the sparse publications on adults with this syndrome which comprises ectodermal dysplasia, multiple cone-shaped epiphyses prior to puberty, multiple cartilaginous exostoses, and mostly mild intellectual impairment. LGS is caused by deletion of the chromosomal segment 8q24.11-q24.13 containing among others the genes EXT1 and TRPS1. Most patients with TRPS2 are only borderline or mildly cognitively delayed, and few are of normal intelligence. Their practical skills are better than their intellectual capability, and, for this reason and because of their low self-esteem, they are often underestimated. Some patients develop seizures at variable age. Osteomas on processes of cervical vertebrae may cause pressure on cervical nerves or dissection of cerebral arteries. Joint stiffness is observed during childhood and changes later to joint laxity causing instability and proneness to trauma. Perthes disease is not rare. Almost all males become bald at or soon after puberty, and some develop (pseudo) gynecomastia. Growth hormone deficiency was found in a few patients, TSH deficiency so far only in one. Puberty and fertility are diminished, and no instance of transmission of the deletion from a non-mosaic parent to a child has been observed so far. Several affected females had vaginal atresia with consequent hydrometrocolpos."
23912505,KANTS: a stigmergic ant algorithm for cluster analysis and swarm art,Carlos M Fernandes,"KANTS is a swarm intelligence clustering algorithm inspired by the behavior of social insects. It uses stigmergy as a strategy for clustering large datasets and, as a result, displays a typical behavior of complex systems: self-organization and global patterns emerging from the local interaction of simple units. This paper introduces a simplified version of KANTS and describes recent experiments with the algorithm in the context of a contemporary artistic and scientific trend called swarm art, a type of generative art in which swarm intelligence systems are used to create artwork or ornamental objects. KANTS is used here for generating color drawings from the input data that represent real-world phenomena, such as electroencephalogram sleep data. However, the main proposal of this paper is an art project based on well-known abstract paintings, from which the chromatic values are extracted and used as input. Colors and shapes are therefore reorganized by KANTS, which generates its own interpretation of the original artworks. The project won the 2012 Evolutionary Art, Design, and Creativity Competition."
23912165,Molecular assembly of the aerolysin pore reveals a swirling membrane-insertion mechanism,Matteo T Degiacomi,"Aerolysin is the founding member of a superfamily of β-pore-forming toxins whose pore structure is unknown. We have combined X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, molecular dynamics and computational modeling to determine the structures of aerolysin mutants in their monomeric and heptameric forms, trapped at various stages of the pore formation process. A dynamic modeling approach based on swarm intelligence was applied, whereby the intrinsic flexibility of aerolysin extracted from new X-ray structures was used to fully exploit the cryo-EM spatial restraints. Using this integrated strategy, we obtained a radically new arrangement of the prepore conformation and a near-atomistic structure of the aerolysin pore, which is fully consistent with all of the biochemical data available so far. Upon transition from the prepore to pore, the aerolysin heptamer shows a unique concerted swirling movement, accompanied by a vertical collapse of the complex, ultimately leading to the insertion of a transmembrane β-barrel."
23910982,Preterm infant linear growth and adiposity gain: trade-offs for later weight status and intelligence quotient,Mandy B Belfort,"Objective: To examine trade-offs between cognitive outcome and overweight/obesity in preterm-born infants at school age and young adulthood in relation to weight gain and linear growth during infancy. Study design: We studied 945 participants in the Infant Health and Development Program, an 8-center study of preterm (≤37 weeks gestational age), low birth weight (≤2500 g) infants from birth to age 18 years. Adjusting for maternal and child factors in logistic regression, we estimated the odds of overweight/obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥85th percentile at age 8 or ≥25 kg/m(2) at age 18) and in separate models, low IQ (<85) per z-score changes in infant length and BMI from term to 4 months, from 4 to 12 months, and from 12 to 18 months. Results: More rapid linear growth from term to 4 months was associated with lower odds of IQ <85 at age 8 years (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.96), but higher odds of overweight/obesity (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05-1.53). More rapid BMI gain in all 3 infant time intervals was also associated with higher odds of overweight/obesity, and BMI gain from 4-12 months was associated with lower odds of IQ <85 at age 8. Results at age 18 were similar. Conclusion: In these preterm, low birth weight infants born in the 1980s, faster linear growth soon after term was associated with better cognition, but also with a greater risk of overweight/obesity at age 8 years and 18 years. BMI gain over the entire 18 months after term was associated with later risk of overweight/obesity, with less evidence of a benefit for IQ."
23910685,Cognitive features that distinguish preschool-age children with neurofibromatosis type 1 from their peers: a matched case-control study,Jennifer Lorenzo,"Objective: To examine the cognitive functioning of 40-month-old children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Study design: In this case-control study, 43 children with NF1 and 43 comparison children (matched by age, sex, and maternal years of education) were assessed using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Third Edition. Language, visual perception, preliteracy, and executive functioning were also examined. Parents completed questionnaires about their child's behavior. Group differences were examined using the paired-samples t test or the related Wilcoxon signed rank test. Conditional logistic regression was conducted to identify which cognitive variables predicted group membership (ie, NF1 or control). Results: The NF1 group had significantly poorer general intelligence than matched comparisons. Preschool-age children with NF1 had significantly poorer language, visual perception, response inhibition, and preliteracy skills than comparison children. The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Third Edition, Object Assembly and Information subtests were significant predictors of group membership. Parent ratings indicated no group differences in behavior. Conclusions: After accounting for potentially confounding variables of age, sex, and maternal years of education, young children with NF1 have significantly poorer intellectual functioning, expressive language, and visual perception. These cognitive features that distinguish young children with NF1 from healthy peers can be detected in the preschool age group and are likely to impact on learning and performance during early school years. These areas should be targeted for intervention to maximize the developmental outcomes of young children with NF1."
23909943,In praise of a doctor who welcomes the newborn infant person,Colwyn Trevarthen,"This article recalls how Dr. Berry Brazelton, in the past 50 years, has transformed pediatrics and childcare and supported parents' understanding of their young children. Berry's work as a pediatrician and basic research in the psychobiology of childbirth and infant communication and care have proved to be richly complementary. Brazelton and the author were fortunate to meet in the context of the wide exploration of human nature and adaptations of human intelligence for cooperative life encouraged by Jerome Bruner's vision of how cultural awareness of meaning may be generated in affectionate relations from infancy. This opened a new awareness of the adaptations of the human mind for sharing the creation of a meaningful world by exploring playful imagination with companions."
23909180,Emotional intelligence and its role in recruitment of nursing students,Steven Robert Lyon,"This article considers the concept of emotional intelligence and how it can be used in the recruitment and development of nursing students. The links between emotional intelligence and the qualities of compassion and caring are examined. The ethical difficulties surrounding the use of emotional intelligence tests are explored and the value of using a variety of recruitment methods is emphasised. The article suggests that emotional intelligence is an ability which may be developed through nurse education programmes, even if not fully present at interview. The contribution of service users to the recruitment of nursing students is examined, suggesting that they offer some important observations about interviewees. These observations may be more valid than the insights gained from the use of emotional intelligence tests."
23908143,Masters athletes exhibit larger regional brain volume and better cognitive performance than sedentary older adults,Benjamin Y Tseng,"Purpose: To investigate differences in the age-related decline in brain tissue concentration between Masters athletes and sedentary older adults. Materials and methods: Twelve Masters athletes (MA) (three females, age = 72.4 ± 5.6 years, endurance training >15 years), 12 sedentary elderly (SE) similar in age and educational level (four females, age = 74.6 ± 4.3 years), and nine young controls (YC) (four females, age = 27.2 ± 3.6 years) participated. T1-weighted high-resolution (1 × 1 × 1mm(3) ) images were acquired. Voxel-based analysis was conducted to identify clusters showing tissue concentration differences with t-tests. Cognitive function was assessed using a standard clinical battery focused on executive function and memory. Results: Two MA and two SE were unable to complete the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Both SE and MA showed lower gray matter (GM) concentrations than YC in the superior, inferior and middle frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and the cingulate gyrus (PFDR-corrected < 0.001) and lower white matter (WM) concentrations in the inferior frontal gyrus and precentral gyrus (PFDR-corrected < 0.005). Notably, MA showed higher GM and WM concentrations than SE in the subgyral, cuneus, and precuneus regions related to visuospatial function, motor control, and working memory (PFDR-corrected < 0.005). After controlling for estimated intelligence, MA outperformed SE on tasks of letter (P < 0.01) and category (P < 0.05) fluency. Conclusion: Life-long exercise may confer benefits to some aspects of executive function and age-related brain tissue loss in the regions related to visuospatial function, motor control, and working memory in older adults."
23908018,Artificial neural network in breast lesions from fine-needle aspiration cytology smear,R M Subbaiah,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are applied in engineering and certain medical fields. ANN has immense potential and is rarely been used in breast lesions. In this present study, we attempted to build up a complete robust back propagation ANN model based on cytomorphological data, morphometric data, nuclear densitometric data, and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of ductal carcinoma and fibroadenomas of breast cases diagnosed on fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). We selected 52 cases of fibroadenomas and 60 cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma of breast diagnosed on FNAC by two cytologists. Essential cytological data was quantitated by two independent cytologists (SRM, PD). With the help of Image J software, nuclear morphomeric, densitometric, and GLCM features were measured in all the cases on hematoxylin and eosin-stained smears. With the available data, an ANN model was built up with the help of Neurointelligence software. The network was designed as 41-20-1 (41 input nodes, 20 hidden nodes, 1 output node). The network was trained by the online back propagation algorithm and 500 iterations were done. Learning was adjusted after every iteration. ANN model correctly identified all cases of fibroadenomas and infiltrating carcinomas in the test set. This is one of the first successful composite ANN models of breast carcinomas. This basic model can be used to diagnose the gray zone area of the breast lesions on FNAC. We assume that this model may have far-reaching implications in future."
23907537,The impact of finger counting habits on arithmetic in adults and children,Sharlene D Newman,"Here, we explored the impact of finger counting habits on arithmetic in both adults and children. Two groups of participants were examined, those that begin counting with their left hand (left-starters) and those that begin counting with their right hand (right-starters). For the adults, performance on an addition task in which participants added 2 two-digit numbers was compared. The results revealed that left-starters were slower than right-starters when adding and they had lower forward and backward digit-span scores. The children (aged 5-12) showed similar results on a single-digit timed addition task-right-starters outperformed left-starters. However, the children did not reveal differences in working memory or verbal and non-verbal intelligence as a function of finger counting habit. We argue that the motor act of finger counting influences how number is represented and suggest that left-starters may have a more bilateral representation that accounts for the slower processing."
23906312,Psychomotor and cognitive impairments of children with CHARGE syndrome: common and variable features,Elisabeth Lasserre,"Objective: We aimed to understand the mechanisms and sources of learning difficulties in children with CHARGE syndrome who attend school and to determine any specific developmental characteristics. Method: We analyzed the psychomotor and cognitive functions of eight children from 7 to 13 years old with classical CHARGE syndrome by using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), the Neuropsychomotor test (NP-MOT), and several subtests of the Developmental neuropsychological assessment (NEPSY) and Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) instruments. Results: The IQ range was from 54 to 92. The main weaknesses related to three domains: static and dynamic postural control, visuospatio-constructive abilities, and both sequential processing and selective attention. The main strengths were in holistic perception, semantic competencies, logical reasoning and planning skills, with axial and peripheral hypotonia. The extent of psychomotor and cognitive deficits was not associated with severity of sensorial deficiencies. We discuss the multiple causal mechanisms of psychomotor and cognitive difficulties. Conclusion: We found a persistent and homogeneous psychomotor profile and specific cognitive difficulties in 8 children with CHARGE syndrome despite their large range of IQs. Highlighting these specific impairments is important to understand the nature and mechanisms of CHARGE for adapting educational and rehabilitation methods. These problems may be explained by sensory deficits, as well as dysfunction in integrating and/or regulatory regions of the brain."
23904618,Decoding the neuroanatomical basis of reading ability: a multivoxel morphometric study,Qinghua He,"As a relatively recent cultural invention in human evolution, reading is an important gateway to personal development and socioeconomic success. Despite the well documented individual differences in reading ability, its neuroanatomical correlates have not been well understood, largely due to the fact that reading is a complex skill that consists of multiple components. Using a large sample of 416 college students and 7 reading tasks, the present study successfully identified three uncorrelated components of reading ability: phonological decoding, form-sound association, and naming speed. We then tried to predict individuals' scores in these components from their gray matter volume (GMV) on a subset of participants (N = 253) with high-quality structural images, adopting a multivariate support vector regression analysis with tenfold cross-validation. Our results revealed distinct neural regions that supported different aspects of reading ability: whereas phonological decoding was associated with the GMV in the left superior parietal lobe extending to the supramarginal gyrus, form-sound association was predicted by the GMV in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Naming speed was associated with GMV in distributed brain regions in the occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices. Phonological decoding and form-sound association were uncorrelated with general cognitive abilities. However, naming speed was correlated with intelligence and processing speed, and some of the regions that were predictive of naming speed also predicted these general cognitive abilities. These results provide further insights on the cognitive and neural architecture of reading and the structural basis of individual differences in reading abilities."
23903878,Prenatal methylmercury exposure and genetic predisposition to cognitive deficit at age 8 years,Jordi Julvez,"Background: Cognitive consequences at school age associated with prenatal methylmercury (MeHg) exposure may need to take into account nutritional and sociodemographic cofactors as well as relevant genetic polymorphisms. Methods: A subsample (n = 1,311) of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (Bristol, UK) was selected, and mercury (Hg) concentrations were measured in freeze-dried umbilical cord tissue as a measure of MeHg exposure. A total of 1135 children had available data on 247 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within relevant genes, as well as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores at age 8 years. Multivariate regression models were used to assess the associations between MeHg exposure and IQ and to determine possible gene-environment interactions. Results: Hg concentrations indicated low background exposures (mean = 26 ng/g, standard deviation = 13). Log10-transformed Hg was positively associated with IQ, which attenuated after adjustment for nutritional and sociodemographic cofactors. In stratified analyses, a reverse association was found in higher social class families (for performance IQ, P value for interaction = 0.0013) among whom there was a wider range of MeHg exposure. Among 40 SNPs showing nominally significant main effects, MeHg interactions were detected for rs662 (paraoxonase 1) and rs1042838 (progesterone receptor) (P < 0.05) and for rs3811647 (transferrin) and rs2049046 (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) (P < 0.10). Conclusions: In this population with a low level of MeHg exposure, there were only equivocal associations between MeHg exposure and adverse neuropsychological outcomes. Heterogeneities in several relevant genes suggest possible genetic predisposition to MeHg neurotoxicity in a substantial proportion of the population. Future studies need to address this possibility."
23903071,Influence of the NRGN gene on intellectual ability in schizophrenia,Kazutaka Ohi,"Genome-wide association studies have reported an association between schizophrenia and rs12807809 of the neurogranin (NRGN) gene. We have recently found that an rs12807809-rs12278912 haplotype of the gene is associated with schizophrenia in a Japanese population and that the NRGN expression of the high-risk TG haplotype is lower than that of the protective TA haplotype in immortalized lymphoblasts. In this study, we investigated the influences of neurogranin genotypes (rs12807809 and rs12278912), haplotypes and diplotypes and genetic variant-diagnosis interactions on intellectual ability in 414 Japanese patients with schizophrenia and healthy subjects. We detected possible effects of the genome-wide screen-supported rs12807809, haplotypes, diplotypes and their genetic variant-diagnosis interactions on intellectual abilities at the threshold level of P<0.05. After applying Bonferroni correction for 13 genotype measures and setting P-values for significance (P<0.0039; 0.05/13), three effects remained significant: the rs12807809-rs12278912 diplotype-diagnosis interactions on performance intelligence quotient (CG/CG: P=3.9 × 10(-13); TA/TA: P=1.1 × 10(-7)) and TA/TA diplotype on performance intelligence quotient in patients with schizophrenia (P=8.2 × 10(-8)) remained significant. The intellectual abilities of the high-risk TG/TG diplotype of the neurogranin gene were lower compared to those with the non-risk TA/TA diplotype. Our findings suggest that the genetic risk variant in the neurogranin gene may be related to reduced intellectual ability."
26056634,"Comparative Assessment of Intelligence Quotient among Children Living in High and Low Fluoride Areas of Kutch, India-a Pilot Study",Ramesh Nagarajappa,"Background: Long-term ingestion of large amounts of fluoride can lead to potentially severe skeletal problems and neurological consequences. The study was conducted to assess and compare intelligence quotient of children living in high and low fluoride areas in Kutch, Gujarat, India. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted among 100 school children aged 8 to 10 years, living in Kutch District, Gujarat, India during July 2012. Mundra (2.4 to 3.5 mg/L) and Bhuj (0.5mg/L) were the two villages randomly selected to represent the high and low water fluoride areas respectively. Seguin Form Board Test was used to assess the intelligence quotient (IQ) level of children. Descriptive statistics and independent sample t-test was used for analysis. Results: Mean scores for average, shortest and total timing category were found to be significantly higher (P<0.05) among children living in Mundra (30.45±4.97) than those living in Bhuj (23.20±6.21). Mean differences at 95% confidence interval for these timings were found to be 7.24, 7.28 and 21.78 respectively. In both the villages, females had lower mean timing scores than males but the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). Conclusion: Chronic exposure to high levels of fluoride in water was observed to be associated with lower intelligence quotient."
23899429,Cognitive impairments in poly-drug ketamine users,H J Liang,"Rationale: Cognitive impairment has been found to be reversible in people with substance abuse, particularly those using ketamine. Ketamine users are often poly-substance users. This study compared the cognitive functions of current and former ketamine users who were also abusing other psychoactive substances with those of non-users of illicit drugs as controls. Methods: One hundred ketamine poly-drug users and 100 controls were recruited. Drug users were divided into current (n = 32) and ex-users (n = 64) according to the duration of abstinence from ketamine (>30 days). The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADSA) and the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) were used to evaluate depression and anxiety symptoms and the severity of drug use, respectively. The cognitive test battery comprised verbal memory (Wechsler Memory Scale III: Logic Memory and Word List), visual memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, ROCF), executive function (Stroop, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and Modified Verbal Fluency Test), working memory (Digit Span Backward), and general intelligence (Information, Arithmetic and Digit-Symbol Coding) tests. Results: Current users had higher BDI and HADSA scores than ex-users (p < 0.001 for BDI and p = 0.022 for HADSA) and controls (p < 0.001 for BDI and p = 0.002 for HADSA). Ex-users had higher BDI (p = 0.006) but equal HADSA scores (p = 1.000) compared to controls. Both current and ex-users had lower scores on Logical Memory delayed recall (p = 0.038 for current users and p = 0.032 for ex-users) and ROCF delayed recall (p = 0.033 for current users and p = 0.014 for ex-users) than controls. Current users also performed worse on ROCF recognition than controls (p = 0.002). No difference was found between the cognitive functions of current and ex-users. Conclusions: Ketamine poly-drug users displayed predominantly verbal and visual memory impairments, which persisted in ex-users. The interactive effect of ketamine and poly-drug use on memory needs further investigation."
23898309,"What is working memory capacity, and how can we measure it?",Oliver Wilhelm,"A latent variable study examined whether different classes of working-memory tasks measure the same general construct of working-memory capacity (WMC). Data from 270 subjects were used to examine the relationship between Binding, Updating, Recall-N-back, and Complex Span tasks, and the relations of WMC with secondary memory measures, indicators of cognitive control from two response-conflict paradigms (Simon task and Eriksen flanker task), and fluid intelligence. Confirmatory factor analyses support the concept of a general WMC factor. Results from structural-equation modeling show negligible relations of WMC with response-conflict resolution, and very strong relations of WMC with secondary memory and fluid intelligence. The findings support the hypothesis that individual differences in WMC reflect the ability to build, maintain and update arbitrary bindings."
23898161,Ant colonies outperform individuals when a sensory discrimination task is difficult but not when it is easy,Takao Sasaki,"""Collective intelligence"" and ""wisdom of crowds"" refer to situations in which groups achieve more accurate perception and better decisions than solitary agents. Whether groups outperform individuals should depend on the kind of task and its difficulty, but the nature of this relationship remains unknown. Here we show that colonies of Temnothorax ants outperform individuals for a difficult perception task but that individuals do better than groups when the task is easy. Subjects were required to choose the better of two nest sites as the quality difference was varied. For small differences, colonies were more likely than isolated ants to choose the better site, but this relationship was reversed for large differences. We explain these results using a mathematical model, which shows that positive feedback between group members effectively integrates information and sharpens the discrimination of fine differences. When the task is easier the same positive feedback can lock the colony into a suboptimal choice. These results suggest the conditions under which crowds do or do not become wise."
23897635,Palivizumab prophylaxis during nosocomial outbreaks of respiratory syncytial virus in a neonatal intensive care unit: predicting effectiveness with an artificial neural network model,Loai M Saadah,"Study objective: To identify subgroups of premature infants who may benefit from palivizumab prophylaxis during nosocomial outbreaks of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Design: Retrospective analysis using an artificial intelligence model. Setting: Level IIIB, 35-bed, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at a tertiary care hospital in the United Arab Emirates. Patients: One hundred seventy six premature infants, born at a gestational age of 22-34 weeks, and hospitalized during four RSV outbreaks that occurred between April 2005 and July 2007. Measurements and main results: We collected demographic and clinical data for each patient by using a standardized form. Input data consisted of seven categoric and continuous variables each. We trained, tested, and validated artificial neural networks for three outcomes of interest: mortality, days of supplemental oxygen, and length of NICU stay after the index case was identified. We compared variable impacts and performed reassignments with live predictions to evaluate the effect of palivizumab. Of the 176 infants, 31 (17.6%) received palivizumab during the outbreaks. All neural network configurations converged within 4 seconds in less than 400 training cycles. Infants who received palivizumab required supplemental oxygen for a shorter duration compared with controls (105.2 ± 7.2 days vs 113.2 ± 10.4 days, p=0.003). This benefit was statistically significant in male infants whose birth weight was less than 0.7 kg and who had hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease. Length of NICU stay after identification of the index case and mortality were independent of palivizumab use. Conclusion: Palivizumab may be an effective intervention during nosocomial outbreaks of RSV in a subgroup of extremely low-birth-weight male infants with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease."
23896931,Infant feeding and childhood cognition at ages 3 and 7 years: Effects of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity,Mandy B Belfort,"Importance: Breastfeeding may benefit child cognitive development, but few studies have quantified breastfeeding duration or exclusivity, nor has any study to date examined the role of maternal diet during lactation on child cognition. Objectives: To examine relationships of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity with child cognition at ages 3 and 7 years and to evaluate the extent to which maternal fish intake during lactation modifies associations of infant feeding with later cognition. Design, setting, and participants: Prospective cohort study (Project Viva), a US prebirth cohort that enrolled mothers from April 22, 1999, to July 31, 2002, and followed up children to age 7 years, including 1312 Project Viva mothers and children. Main exposure: Duration of any breastfeeding to age 12 months. Main outcomes and measures: Child receptive language assessed with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test at age 3 years, Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities at ages 3 and 7 years, and Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test and Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning at age 7 years. Results: Adjusting for sociodemographics, maternal intelligence, and home environment in linear regression, longer breastfeeding duration was associated with higher Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test score at age 3 years (0.21; 95% CI, 0.03-0.38 points per month breastfed) and with higher intelligence on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test at age 7 years (0.35; 0.16-0.53 verbal points per month breastfed; and 0.29; 0.05-0.54 nonverbal points per month breastfed). Breastfeeding duration was not associated with Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning scores. Beneficial effects of breastfeeding on the Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities at age 3 years seemed greater for women who consumed 2 or more servings of fish per week (0.24; 0.00-0.47 points per month breastfed) compared with less than 2 servings of fish per week (−0.01; −0.22 to 0.20 points per month breastfed) (P = .16 for interaction). Conclusions and relevance: Our results support a causal relationship of breastfeeding duration with receptive language and verbal and nonverbal intelligence later in life."
23896861,Low birth weight and intelligence in adolescence and early adulthood: a meta-analysis,C E Kormos,"Background: Research has demonstrated an association between low birth weight (LBW; <2500 g) and adverse intelligence quotient (IQ) outcomes in childhood and early adolescence. We systematically evaluated whether this association persists into late adolescence and early adulthood and also assessed the influence of age of IQ assessment on effect size. Methods: During Stage 1 (meta-analysis of data on adolescents/adults), we searched for relevant articles in PsychINFO, PubMed, Ovid, CINAHL, ProQuest and ERIC until February 2011 (no lower limit). Studies which assessed full-scale IQ among LBW individuals (<2500 g), aged 13 years and older, with a normal birth weight (NBW; ≥2500 g) comparison group were eligible. A random-effects meta-analysis provided a pooled estimate of the difference in IQ scores between LBW and NBW individuals. Publication bias was assessed using Rosenthal's classic fail-safe N and Duval and Tweedie's Trim and Fill. During Stage 2, we added data from the Kerr-Wilson et al. meta-analysis (which included data from children; in Meta-analysis of the association between preterm delivery and intelligence. Journal Public Health 2011;33:1-8) to our sample from Stage 1 and conducted a meta-regression to evaluate the effect of age of IQ assessment. Results: Using a total of 15 studies in Stage 1, it was demonstrated that NBW individuals scored an average of 7.63 IQ points higher than LBW individuals, CI = 5.95-9.31. After adjusting for publication bias, NBW samples demonstrated an IQ of 4.98 points higher than LBW samples, CI = 3.20-6.77. Furthermore, age at IQ assessment was a significant moderator of the association between birth weight and IQ, in that the effect size decreased from childhood into young adulthood. Conclusions: Cognitive impairments associated with LBW persist into adolescence and early adulthood; however, the influence of LBW on IQ decreases from childhood to young adulthood. These conclusions must be interpreted with caution due to unmeasured variables and possible influence from publication bias."
23896791,Apgar scores at 10 min and outcomes at 6-7 years following hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy,Girija Natarajan,"Aim: To determine the association between 10 min Apgar scores and 6-7-year outcomes in children with perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) enrolled in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network (NICHD NRN) whole body cooling randomised controlled trial (RCT). Methods: Evaluations at 6-7 years included the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence III or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children IV and Gross Motor Functional Classification Scale. Primary outcome was death/moderate or severe disability. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between 10 min Apgar scores and outcomes after adjusting for birth weight, gestational age, gender, outborn status, hypothermia treatment and centre. Results: In the study cohort (n=174), 64/85 (75%) of those with 10 min Apgar score of 0-3 had death/disability compared with 40/89 (45%) of those with scores >3. Each point increase in 10 min Apgar scores was associated with a significantly lower adjusted risk of death/disability, death, death/IQ <70, death/cerebral palsy (CP) and disability, IQ<70 and CP among survivors (all p<0.05). Among the 24 children with a 10 min Apgar score of 0, five (20.8%) survived without disability. The risk-adjusted probabilities of death/disability were significantly lower in cooled infants with Apgar scores of 0-3; there was no significant interaction between cooling and Apgar scores (p=0.26). Conclusions: Among children with perinatal HIE enrolled in the NICHD cooling RCT, 10 min Apgar scores were significantly associated with school-age outcomes. A fifth of infants with 10 min Apgar score of 0 survived without disability to school age, suggesting the need for caution in limiting resuscitation to a specified duration."
23896571,Questioning the interpretations of behavioral observations of cetaceans: is there really support for a special intellectual status for this mammalian order?,P R Manger,"This review evaluates and contextualizes the behavioral studies undertaken on cetaceans in terms of the relationship of these behaviors to special levels of intelligence associated with these marine mammals and the evolution of their relatively and absolutely large brain size. Many believe that the large size of the cetacean brain and reported behaviors indicate the need to create a special status for these animals in terms of their intellect, positing that they are second to humans in terms of general intelligence. Cetacean brains became relatively large approximately 32millionyearsago, at the Archaeocete-Neocete faunal transition, and have since remained stable in relative size. The behaviors reported for modern cetaceans are thought to parallel those of great apes, to the exclusion of other mammals. By creating an autocatalytic model of cetacean brain evolution, the behaviors thought to be indicative of sophisticated cognitive processes can be assessed as to their potential involvement in the evolution of larger brains in cetaceans. By contextualizing these behaviors in a broader comparative framework, and not the limited cetacean - great ape comparisons mostly used, it is evident that the behaviors used to argue for high levels of intelligence in cetaceans are found commonly across mammals and other vertebrates, and are often observed in invertebrates. This contextualization indicates that cetacean intelligence is qualitatively no different to other vertebrates. In addition, the inability of cetaceans to surpass Piaget stage 4/5 on object permanence tests and to solve an ""if and only if, then"" abstract task indicates the possibility that their levels of general intelligence may be less than that seen in other vertebrates. Sophisticated cognitive abilities appear to play no role in the evolution of large brain size in cetaceans, indicating that alternative theories of large brain size evolution in cetaceans should be considered in more detail."
23896444,Visuo-spatial working memory is an important source of domain-general vulnerability in the development of arithmetic cognition,Sarit Ashkenazi,"The study of developmental disorders can provide a unique window into the role of domain-general cognitive abilities and neural systems in typical and atypical development. Mathematical disabilities (MD) are characterized by marked difficulty in mathematical cognition in the presence of preserved intelligence and verbal ability. Although studies of MD have most often focused on the role of core deficits in numerical processing, domain-general cognitive abilities, in particular working memory (WM), have also been implicated. Here we identify specific WM components that are impaired in children with MD and then examine their role in arithmetic problem solving. Compared to typically developing (TD) children, the MD group demonstrated lower arithmetic performance and lower visuo-spatial working memory (VSWM) scores with preserved abilities on the phonological and central executive components of WM. Whole brain analysis revealed that, during arithmetic problem solving, left posterior parietal cortex, bilateral dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus and precuneus, and fusiform gyrus responses were positively correlated with VSWM ability in TD children, but not in the MD group. Additional analyses using a priori posterior parietal cortex regions previously implicated in WM tasks, demonstrated a convergent pattern of results during arithmetic problem solving. These results suggest that MD is characterized by a common locus of arithmetic and VSWM deficits at both the cognitive and functional neuroanatomical levels. Unlike TD children, children with MD do not use VSWM resources appropriately during arithmetic problem solving. This work advances our understanding of VSWM as an important domain-general cognitive process in both typical and atypical mathematical skill development."
23895609,Arthur R. Jensen (1923-2012),David Lubinski,"Presents an obituary for Arthur R. Jensen. Arthur R. Jensen epitomized the ""London School"" of psychological thought, studying human individuality as a branch of biology by teaming evolutionary, genetic, and experimental/multivariate/quantitative methods to examine psychological diversity. His intellectual ancestry traces back through his mentor Hans Eysenck to Cyril Burt, Charles Spearman, and, ultimately, Sir Francis Galton. Haggbloom et al. (2002, Review of General Psychology) ranked him among the top 50 eminent psychologists of the 20th century primarily for his work on the construct of general intelligence (g) and its antecedents. But he was also known for his studies in human learning, memory, the cumulative deficit hypothesis, Spearman's hypothesis, the speed of information hypothesis, and test bias. Yet, because of the controversial nature of his work, his career was conspicuously marked by tensions: The extent to which his work was either admired or reviled by many distinguished scientists is unparalleled."
23895320,Construct validity of the WISC-IV with a referred sample: direct versus indirect hierarchical structures,Gary L Canivez,"The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) is one of the most frequently used intelligence tests in clinical assessments of children with learning difficulties. Construct validity studies of the WISC-IV have generally supported the higher order structure with four correlated first-order factors and one higher-order general intelligence factor, but recent studies have supported an alternate model in which general intelligence is conceptualized as a breadth factor rather than a superordinate factor (M. W. Watkins, 2010, Structure of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition among a national sample of referred students, Psychological Assessment, Vol. 22, pp. 782-787; M. W. Watkins, G. L. Canivez, T. James, K. & R. Good, in press, Construct validity of the WISC-IVUK with a large referred Irish sample, International Journal of School and Educational Psychology). WISC-IV core subtest data obtained from evaluations to assess learning difficulties in 345 children (224 boys, 121 girls) were examined. One through four, first order factor models and indirect versus direct hierarchical models were compared using confirmatory factor analyses. The correlated four-factor Wechsler model provided good fit to these data, but the direct hierarchical model showed statistically significant improvement over the indirect hierarchical model and correlated four-factor model. The direct hierarchical model was judged the best explanation of the WISC-IV factor structure, with the general factor accounting for 71.6% of the common variance while the first order factors accounted for 2.4-10.3% of the common variance. Thus, the results with the present sample of referred children were similar to those from other investigations (G. E. Gignac, 2005, Revisiting the factor structure of the WAIS-R: Insights through nested factor modeling, Assessment, Vol. 12, pp. 320-329; G. E.

23895183,"Administering design fluency tests in school-aged children: analyses of design productivity over time, clustering, and switching",Petra P M Hurks,"This study investigated the effects of child-related factors (age, sex, and intellectual abilities) upon design fluency (DF) test scores. A DF test, a semantic verbal fluency (VF) test, and a Block Design test, as a proxy of intelligence, were administered to N = 80 healthy native Dutch-speaking children aged 8.45-12.82 years. Three components of DF performance were examined, i.e., design productivity over time, clustering (i.e., generating designs that share visual-spatial similarities, such as addition, deletion, or rotation), and switching (i.e., shifting between strategies that children use to draw the designs). The relation between DF design productivity over time and age was curvilinear, that is, improvements in test scores were much more pronounced for younger children than for older children. No (curvi)linear age effects were found in DF productivity scores, clustering, and switching. Also, our results did not reveal a relation between intellectual abilities and DF test scores. Furthermore, DF test scores and VF test scores were only partially significant, i.e., only significant positive correlations were found between the productivity scores of the VF test and the DF test. Finally, higher order sex by age interactions were found in all DF test scores, i.e., girls <10.5 years produced more designs, made longer clusters, and switched less than boys. Opposite sex differences were found for children >10.5 years. This illustrates the utility of combining quantitative scoring procedures with in-depth clustering and switching to understand interactions between age and sex during DF tests."
23893967,Assessing planning and set-shifting abilities in autism: are experimenter-administered and computerised versions of tasks equivalent?,David Williams,"Across studies, analysis of performance on classic measures of executive functioning (EF) among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests that people with this disorder may be impaired only when tasks are experimenter-administered, but not when the same tasks are computer-administered. This would imply that the underlying cause of apparent executive dysfunction in ASD is a diminished ability to engage with another person/comprehend what another person expects, rather than a diminution of the control processes that typically underpin EF task performance. However, this suggestion is limited because, to our knowledge, no study has directly compared the equivalence of computer-administered and standard experimenter-administered versions of EF tasks that have been presented in counterbalanced order among a common sample of individuals with ASD. In the current study, 21 children with ASD and 22 age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched comparison participants completed, in counterbalanced order, computerised and manual versions of both a planning task and a cognitive flexibility/set-shifting task. Contrary to expectation, results indicated that participants with ASD were equally impaired in terms of the key dependent variable on standard and computerised versions of both tasks. Practically, these results suggest that computer-administered and experimenter-administered versions of planning and set-shifting tasks are equivalent among individuals with ASD and can be used interchangeably in studies of EF among this population. Theoretically, these results challenge the notion that poor performance on EF tasks among school-aged children with ASD is only the result of a limited ability to engage with a human experimenter/comprehend socially presented rules."
23893566,Comorbidity and continuity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from childhood to adolescence in Turkey,H Tuna Cak,"The aim of this study was to examine clinical outcomes, psychiatric comorbidity and neuropsychological characteristics in Turkish adolescents with an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis in childhood. A total of 45 children with ADHD diagnosis and 28 children with a psychiatric diagnosis other than ADHD in a 1-year cohort of 7-10-year-olds were reevaluated 6 years later using Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children Present and Lifetime version and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised and Stroop Test TBAG version. This study shows that the clinical outcomes and the comorbidity patterns for ADHD from childhood to adolescence in Turkey are similar to reported rates in the Western countries. In the ADHD group, 75.6 % still has impairing ADHD symptoms and 46.6 % has comorbid psychiatric disorders. The main difference is anxiety disorders being the most common comorbid disorders (37.8 %) in Turkish ADHD youth. These findings stress the high comorbidity associated with ADHD and support the importance of assessment and treatment for ADHD and comorbidities during adolescence."
23892699,Oral zinc supplementation may improve cognitive function in schoolchildren,José Edson de Moura,"Zinc is an important micronutrient for humans, and zinc deficiency among schoolchildren is deleterious to growth and development, immune competence, and cognitive function. However, the effect of zinc supplementation on cognitive function remains poorly understood. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effect of oral zinc supplementation (5 mg Zn/day for 3 months) on the Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ), Verbal Intelligence Quotient (VIQ), and Performance Intelligence Quotient (PIQ) using a Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III). We studied 36 schoolchildren aged 6 to 9 years (7.8 ± 1.1) using a nonprobability sampling method. The baseline serum zinc concentrations increased significantly after zinc supplementation (p < 0.0001), with no difference between sexes. Tests were administered under basal conditions before and after zinc supplementation, and there was no difference in FSIQ according to gender or age. The results demonstrated that zinc improved the VIQ only in the Information Subtest (p = 0.009), although the supplementation effects were more significant in relation to the PIQ, as these scores improved for the Picture Completion, Picture Arrangement, Block Design, and Object Assembly Subtests (p = 0.0001, for all subtests). In conclusion, zinc supplementation improved specific cognitive abilities, thereby positively influencing the academic performance of schoolchildren, even those without marginal zinc deficiency."
23891768,A critical evaluation of the lateralizing significance of material-specific memory deficits in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis,Malcolm K Jeyaraj,"To critically assess the value of material-specific memory deficits in lateralizing temporal lobe dysfunction preoperatively, we compared the neuropsychological data of 50 consecutive patients with unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS; right: 31, left: 19) with those of 50 age- and education-matched healthy control subjects. On case-control comparison, both the subcohorts with left and right MTLE-HS performed poorly on intelligence tests, in addition to individual memory tests. However, comparison of the verbal and visual memory functions between subcohorts with right and left MTLE-HS revealed that learning trials and delayed word list recall were the only tests that hypothesized left temporal lobe dysfunction. We conclude that material-specific memory deficits are largely test driven, but there is a lateralizing role for task-specific deficits in left MTLE-HS. Although neuropsychological data help to define baseline neuropsychological impairment, caution should be exercised in interpreting the lateralizing value of material-specific memory deficits prior to surgery."
23891724,"Investigating the structure and invariance of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales, Fourth Edition in a sample of adults with intellectual disabilities",Matthew R Reynolds,"Recent research has questioned whether the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales (WAIS) measure the same constructs for adults with intellectual disabilities as they do for the general population (MacLean et al., 2011). Using the special validity sample of the WAIS-IV (Wechsler, 2008b), the structure of the WAIS-IV was investigated using confirmatory factor analysis and tested for measurement invariance across a sample with intellectual disabilities and a control group matched in demographic characteristics. The instrument demonstrated strong factorial invariance when the standard subtests were used. When the standard and supplemental subtests were included in the model, the WAIS-IV four-factor structure provided a model of measurement for the Subtest Scores in the intellectual disability group, but the Perceptual Reasoning factor demonstrated differentiation into Fluid Reasoning and Visual-Spatial factors in the matched control group. In general, the research findings suggest that the four-factor structure of the WAIS-IV is invariant across the intellectual disability and matched control groups."
23891719,Computational intelligence techniques in bioinformatics,Aboul Ella Hassanien,"Computational intelligence (CI) is a well-established paradigm with current systems having many of the characteristics of biological computers and capable of performing a variety of tasks that are difficult to do using conventional techniques. It is a methodology involving adaptive mechanisms and/or an ability to learn that facilitate intelligent behavior in complex and changing environments, such that the system is perceived to possess one or more attributes of reason, such as generalization, discovery, association and abstraction. The objective of this article is to present to the CI and bioinformatics research communities some of the state-of-the-art in CI applications to bioinformatics and motivate research in new trend-setting directions. In this article, we present an overview of the CI techniques in bioinformatics. We will show how CI techniques including neural networks, restricted Boltzmann machine, deep belief network, fuzzy logic, rough sets, evolutionary algorithms (EA), genetic algorithms (GA), swarm intelligence, artificial immune systems and support vector machines, could be successfully employed to tackle various problems such as gene expression clustering and classification, protein sequence classification, gene selection, DNA fragment assembly, multiple sequence alignment, and protein function prediction and its structure. We discuss some representative methods to provide inspiring examples to illustrate how CI can be utilized to address these problems and how bioinformatics data can be characterized by CI. Challenges to be addressed and future directions of research are also presented and an extensive bibliography is included."
23891364,The perception of sexuality in older adults and its relationship with cognitive functioning,Carien Hartmans,"Objectives: Investigating whether cognitive functioning is associated with the perception of one's sexuality in old age. Design: Cross-sectional analysis, using observation cycle 2005/2006 of the population-based prospective cohort of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. Setting: Municipal registries in three Dutch regions. Participants: 1,908 older adults (mean [standard deviation] age: 71 [8.87] years; 54% women). Measurements: Sexuality and intimacy were assessed using four questions. Four cognitive domains were assessed: general cognitive functioning (Mini-Mental State Examination), memory performance (Auditory Verbal Learning Test), processing speed (Coding Task), and fluid intelligence (Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices). Multinomial regression analysis was used, with sexuality as outcome. The interaction effect between gender and sexuality was also tested. Results: Lower fluid intelligence was associated with perceiving sexuality as unimportant; lower general cognitive functioning was associated with perceiving sexuality as unimportant; and lower immediate memory recall was associated with evaluating sexual life as unpleasant. Associations were also found between lower fluid intelligence, processing speed, and general cognitive functioning, and agreeing with sexuality no longer being important. Lower processing speed, general cognitive functioning, and delayed memory recall were associated with disagreeing with a remaining need for intimacy when getting older. Finally, the association between fluid intelligence and perceiving sexuality as important, and the association between immediate memory recall score and evaluating sexual life as pleasant, was only significant in women. The association between lower general cognitive functioning and perceiving sexuality as unimportant seemed stronger in women compared with men. Conclusions: Higher cognitive functioning was associated with the way in which older people perceive their current sexuality."
23891115,Frequency-dependent enhancement of fluid intelligence induced by transcranial oscillatory potentials,Emiliano Santarnecchi,"Everyday problem solving requires the ability to go beyond experience by efficiently encoding and manipulating new information, i.e., fluid intelligence (Gf) [1]. Performance in tasks involving Gf, such as logical and abstract reasoning, has been shown to rely on distributed neural networks, with a crucial role played by prefrontal regions [2]. Synchronization of neuronal activity in the gamma band is a ubiquitous phenomenon within the brain; however, no evidence of its causal involvement in cognition exists to date [3]. Here, we show an enhancement of Gf ability in a cognitive task induced by exogenous rhythmic stimulation within the gamma band. Imperceptible alternating current [4] delivered through the scalp over the left middle frontal gyrus resulted in a frequency-specific shortening of the time required to find the correct solution in a visuospatial abstract reasoning task classically employed to measure Gf abilities (i.e., Raven's matrices) [5]. Crucially, gamma-band stimulation (γ-tACS) selectively enhanced performance only on more complex trials involving conditional/logical reasoning. The present finding supports a direct involvement of gamma oscillatory activity in the mechanisms underlying higher-order human cognition."
23890775,Serious fighting-related injuries produce a significant reduction in intelligence,Joseph A Schwartz,"Purpose: Fighting-related injuries are common among adolescents within the United States, but how such injuries relate to subsequent cognitive functioning remains unclear. In particular, the long-term effect of fighting-related injuries suffered during important developmental periods, such as adolescence, on subsequent cognitive functioning has been overlooked by previous studies. The purpose of this study is to examine the association between sustaining serious fighting-related injuries and changes in verbal intelligence (IQ) over a 5- to 6-year time period. Methods: Longitudinal multivariate statistical models were used to analyze data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health collected between 1994 and 2002 and analyzed in 2013. Results: Even a single fighting-related injury resulted in a significant reduction in IQ over time even after controlling for age, race, sex, and changes in socioeconomic status (SES) over the study period. Additionally, females experienced a significantly greater reduction in IQ from each fighting-related injury than males. Conclusions: Fighting-related injuries have a significant impact on subsequent cognitive functioning and intelligence. The implications for future policies and research are discussed in more detail."
23890751,Regional cortical thinning predicts worsening apathy and hallucinations across the Alzheimer disease spectrum,Nancy J Donovan,"Objectives: To examine regions of cortical thinning and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarkers associated with apathy and hallucinations in a continuum of individuals including clinically normal elderly, mild cognitive impairment, and mild AD dementia. Design: Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Setting: Fifty-seven research sites across North America. Participants: Eight-hundred twelve community-dwelling volunteers; 413 participants in the CSF sub-study. Measurements: Structural magnetic resonance imaging data and CSF concentrations of amyloid-β 1-42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau derived from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were analyzed. Apathy and hallucinations were measured at baseline and over 3 years using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire. General linear models and mixed effects models were used to evaluate the relationships among baseline cortical thickness in seven regions, and baseline CSF biomarkers, apathy, and hallucinations at baseline and longitudinally. Covariates included diagnosis, sex, age, apolipoprotein E genotype, premorbid intelligence, memory performance, processing speed, antidepressant use, and AD duration. Results: Reduced baseline inferior temporal cortical thickness was predictive of increasing apathy over time, and reduced supramarginal cortical thickness was predictive of increasing hallucinations over time. There was no association with cortical thickness at baseline. CSF biomarkers were not related to severity of apathy or hallucinations in cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses. Conclusions: These results suggest that greater baseline temporal and parietal atrophy is associated with worsening apathy and hallucinations in a large AD spectrum cohort, while adjusting for multiple disease-related variables. Localized cortical neurodegeneration may contribute to the pathophysiology of apathy and hallucinations and their adverse consequences in AD."
23889995,Whole-genome DNA/RNA sequencing identifies truncating mutations in RBCK1 in a novel Mendelian disease with neuromuscular and cardiac involvement,Kai Wang,"Background: Whole-exome sequencing has identified the causes of several Mendelian diseases by analyzing multiple unrelated cases, but it is more challenging to resolve the cause of extremely rare and suspected Mendelian diseases from individual families. We identified a family quartet with two children, both affected with a previously unreported disease, characterized by progressive muscular weakness and cardiomyopathy, with normal intelligence. During the course of the study, we identified one additional unrelated patient with a comparable phenotype. Methods: We performed whole-genome sequencing (Complete Genomics platform), whole-exome sequencing (Agilent SureSelect exon capture and Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform), SNP genotyping (Illumina HumanHap550 SNP array) and Sanger sequencing on blood samples, as well as RNA-Seq (Illumina HiSeq platform) on transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines. Results: From whole-genome sequence data, we identified RBCK1, a gene encoding an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, as the most likely candidate gene, with two protein-truncating mutations in probands in the first family. However, exome data failed to nominate RBCK1 as a candidate gene, due to poor regional coverage. Sanger sequencing identified a private homozygous splice variant in RBCK1 in the proband in the second family, yet SNP genotyping revealed a 1.2Mb copy-neutral region of homozygosity covering RBCK1. RNA-Seq confirmed aberrant splicing of RBCK1 transcripts, resulting in truncated protein products. Conclusions: While the exact mechanism by which these mutations cause disease is unknown, our study represents an example of how the combined use of whole-genome DNA and RNA sequencing can identify a disease-predisposing gene for a novel and extremely rare Mendelian disease."
23886906,"Associations between emotional intelligence, depression and suicide risk in nursing students",Amor Aradilla-Herrero,"Background: The most important factor which predisposes young people to suicide is depression, although protective factors such as self-esteem, emotional adaptation and social support may reduce the probability of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Several studies have indicated an elevated risk of suicide for health-related professions. Little is known, however, about the relationship between perceived emotional intelligence and suicide risk among nursing students. Objectives: The main goals were to determine the prevalence of suicide risk in a sample of nursing students, to examine the relationship between suicide risk and perceived emotional intelligence, depression, trait anxiety and self-esteem, and to identify any gender differences in relation to these variables. Method: Cross-sectional study of nursing students (n=93) who completed self-report measures of perceived emotional intelligence (Trait Meta-Mood Scale, which evaluates three dimensions: emotional attention, clarity and repair), suicide risk (Plutchik Suicide Risk Scale), self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale), depression (Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale) and anxiety (Trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). Results: Linear regression analysis confirmed that depression and emotional attention are significant predictors of suicidal ideation. Moreover, suicide risk showed a significant negative association with self-esteem and with emotional clarity and repair. Gender differences were only observed in relation to depression, on which women scored significantly higher. Overall, 14% of the students were considered to present a substantial suicide risk. Conclusions: The findings suggest that interventions to prevent suicidal ideation among nursing students should include strategies to detect mood disorders (especially depression) and to improve emotional coping skills. In line with previous research the results indicate that high scores on emotional attention are linked to heightened emotional susceptibility and an increased risk of suicide. The identification and prevention of factors associated with suicidal behaviour in nursing students should be regarded as a priority."
23886763,"Cognitive flexibility impairments in children with autism spectrum disorders: links to age, gender and child outcomes",Amir Hossein Memari,"There are still many questions about the cognitive flexibility in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that remain unanswered. The goal of current study was to evaluate cognitive flexibility patterns and their demographic, clinical and behavioral correlates in large sample of children with ASD. A total of 123 children (94 boys and 29 girls) with ASD aged 7-14 years were assessed on the Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST). Findings showed that gender but not age was associated with the cognitive flexibility performance in ASD. Individuals who had more parent-reported language deficits, lower level of intelligence and education, and showed lower daily sleep time or more engagement in solitary instead of social daily activities were more likely to demonstrate perseveration. Findings provide tentative evidence of a link between cognitive flexibility deficits and sociodemographic or clinical child outcomes in ASD."
23885545,Selected aspects of social cognition in patient with total agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) and Arnold-Chiari desease--case study],Beata Daniluk,"Aim: The goal of the research was a characteristic of emotional-social competencies and communicative abilities in a 16-years old patient with ACC and Arnold-Chiari disease and higher than average intelligence. Method: RHLB-PL was applied. Results: Total score in RHLB-PL suggested language and communication impairment. The greatest problems were observed in the field of behavioral self-control and discourse abilities. The patient had difficulties in the topic of the discourse maintaining, resisting from production of unconnected topics and comments, interject inappropriate remarks. Problems in humor comprehension and the dissociation between relative high level of written metaphors analysis abilities and low level of Picture Metaphors perception and explanation were observed. Linguistic Prosody was average. Conclusion: Patient M.J. with agenesis of corpus callosum presented high number of deficits typical in right hemisphere damage patients. It is possible to explain that fact in the context of interhemispheric transfer disorders, specially when complex material was processed."
23885396,Achieving organisational competence for clinical leadership: the role of high performance work systems,Sandra G Leggat,"Purpose: While there has been substantial discussion about the potential for clinical leadership in improving quality and safety in healthcare, there has been little robust study. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a qualitative study with clinicians and clinician managers to gather opinions on the appropriate content of an educational initiative being planned to improve clinical leadership in quality and safety among medical, nursing and allied health professionals working in primary, community and secondary care. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 28 clinicians and clinician managers throughout the state of Victoria, Australia, participated in focus groups to provide advice on the development of a clinical leadership program in quality and safety. An inductive, thematic analysis was completed to enable the themes to emerge from the data. Findings: Overwhelmingly the participants conceptualised clinical leadership in relation to organisational factors. Only four individual factors, comprising emotional intelligence, resilience, self-awareness and understanding of other clinical disciplines, were identified as being important for clinical leaders. Conversely seven organisational factors, comprising role clarity and accountability, security and sustainability for clinical leaders, selective recruitment into clinical leadership positions, teamwork and decentralised decision making, training, information sharing, and transformational leadership, were seen as essential, but the participants indicated they were rarely addressed. The human resource management literature includes these seven components, with contingent reward, reduced status distinctions and measurement of management practices, as the essential organisational underpinnings of high performance work systems. Practical implications: The results of this study propose that clinical leadership is an organisational property, suggesting that capability frameworks and educational programs for clinical leadership need a broader organisation focus. Originality/value: The paper makes clear that clinical leadership was not perceived to be about vesting leadership skills in individuals, but about ensuring health care organisations were equipped to conceptualise and support a model of distributive leadership."
23885245,What is the emotional core of the multidimensional Machiavellian personality trait?,Syrina Al Aïn,"Machiavellianism is a personality trait characterized by interpersonal manipulation and associated with specific patterns of emotional and social cognition skills. The aim of this study was to investigate its socio-cognitive characteristics by determining its association and predictors on the basis of a multidimensional approach to Machiavellianism. We used Mach IV scale to assess ""Machiavellian Intelligence"" skill of participants (Christie and Geis, 1970). It includes three subscales that are (1) the use of deceit in interpersonal relationships, (2) a cynical view of human nature and (3) the lack of morality. Associations were found between Machiavellianism and low levels of empathy and affective ToM, and high levels of alexithymia, anhedonia, depression, and anxiety. These associations were observed in varying proportions depending on the three subscales of Machiavellianism. The addition of anhedonia and trait-anxiety to the concepts of empathy and alexithymia made it possible to gain a better understanding of the emotional core of Machiavellianism. These findings are discussed in the light of developmental and adaptive perspectives."
23885231,Haploinsufficiency of ANKRD11 (16q24.3) Is Not Obligatorily Associated with Cognitive Impairment but Shows a Clinical Overlap with Silver-Russell Syndrome,S Spengler,"Microdeletions in 16q24.3 are associated with intellectual disability and a specific phenotype, e.g. short stature and a prominent forehead. The 16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome shows a broad phenotypic overlap with the KBG syndrome, which is caused by mutations within the ANKRD11 gene. Furthermore, both KBG and the 16q24.3 microdeletion syndromes show clinical findings reminiscent of Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), an imprinting disorder characterized by severe primordial growth retardation. In a cohort of patients referred as SRS, we previously identified a 16q24.3 deletion, but at that time, only patients with larger imbalances in 16q24.3 and intellectual disability had been published. Considering the recent description of the ANKRD11 gene as the causative factor for the 2 16q24.3-associated disorders, we now classified our patient as a 16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome patient exhibiting some characteristic features but normal intelligence. Our case illustrates the broad clinical spectrum associated with microdeletions, and we confirm that the 16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome is a further microdeletion syndrome with very variable expressivity. Indeed, our case is the first 16q24.3 patient of normal intelligence, but we assume that this variant is present in further mentally healthy probands which have not yet been tested. In conclusion, the detection of the 16q24.3 deletion in a proband of unremarkable intellectual capacities once again illustrates the need to perform molecular karyotyping in dysmorphic patients with normal intelligence."
23882244,Gender differences in school achievement: The role of self-regulation,Mirjam Weis,"This study examined whether different aspects of self-regulation (i.e., emotion and behavior regulation) account for gender differences in German and mathematics achievement. Specifically, we investigated whether higher school achievement by girls in comparison to boys can be explained by self-regulation. German and mathematics achievement were assessed in a sample of 53 German fifth graders (19 boys, 34 girls) using formal academic performance tests (i.e., reading, writing, mathematics) and teachers' ratings (i.e., grades in German and mathematics). Moreover, teachers rated children's behavior regulation using the Self-Control Scale (SCS-K-D). Children's self-reported strategies of emotion regulation were assessed with the Questionnaire for the Measurement of Stress and Coping in Children and Adolescents (SSKJ 3-8). Age and intelligence (CFT 20-R) were included as control variables. Analyses of mean differences showed that girls outperformed boys in German achievement and behavior regulation. Regression analyses, using a bootstrapping method, revealed that relations between gender and German achievement were mediated by behavior regulation. Furthermore, we found a suppression effect of behavior regulation on the relation between gender and mathematics achievement: boys' mathematics achievement was underestimated when the analyses did not control for behavior regulation. We discuss these results from a developmental perspective and within the theoretical framework of self-regulation and achievement."
23881877,Human psychobiology of MDMA or 'Ecstasy': an overview of 25 years of empirical research,Andrew C Parrott,"Aims: This paper aimed to review how scientific knowledge about the human psychobiology of MDMA has developed over time. Methods: In this paper, the empirical findings from earlier and later studies will be reviewed. Results: When MDMA was a 'novel psychoactive substance', it was not seen as a drug of abuse, as it displayed loss of efficacy. However, recreational users display a unique pattern of increasing doses, deteriorating cost-benefit ratios, and voluntary cessation. MDMA increases body temperature and thermal stress, with cortisol levels increased by 800% in dance clubbers. It can be extremely euphoric, although negative moods are also intensified. MDMA causes apoptosis (programmed cell death) and has been investigated for cancer therapy because of its anti-lymphoma properties. Recreational users show deficits in retrospective memory, prospective memory, higher cognition, problem solving, and social intelligence. Basic cognitive skills remain intact. Neuroimaging studies show reduced serotonin transporter levels across the cerebral cortex, which are associated with neurocognitive impairments. Deficits also occur in sleep architecture, sleep apnoea, complex vision, pain, neurohormones, and psychiatric status. Ecstasy/MDMA use during pregnancy leads to psychomotor impairments in the children. Conclusions: The damaging effects of Ecstasy/MDMA are far more widespread than was realized a few years ago, with new neuropsychobiological deficits still emerging."
23880396,Language and internalizing and externalizing behavioral adjustment: developmental pathways from childhood to adolescence,Marc H Bornstein,"Two independent prospective longitudinal studies that cumulatively spanned the age interval from 4 years to 14 years used multiwave designs to investigate developmental associations between language and behavioral adjustment (internalizing and externalizing behavior problems). Altogether 224 children, their mothers, and teachers provided data. Series of nested path analysis models were used to determine the most parsimonious and plausible paths among the three constructs over and above stability in each across age and their covariation at each age. In both studies, children with poorer language skills in early childhood had more internalizing behavior problems in later childhood and in early adolescence. These developmental paths between language and behavioral adjustment held after taking into consideration children's nonverbal intellectual functioning, maternal verbal intelligence, education, parenting knowledge, and social desirability bias, as well as family socioeconomic status, and they applied equally to girls and boys."
23879977,Latest evidence about longevity of Sun Simiao],Zhen-Min Song,"Recording in the preface of Binglishufu (written by Lu Zhaolin of the Tang Dynasty) was the only direct evidence about the longevity of Sun Simiao. It recorded 'Sun Simiao said since his birth in the Xinyou Year of the Kaihuang Period, he was 93 years old'. But there were disputes over the time of Xinyou Year-581 AD or 541 AD? It is easy to pick holes in both arguments and the whole research, so the conclusion is not reliable. Recordings in Biography of Sun Simiao, which said 'the governor of the Luozhou area marveled at Sun's intelligence and called him the saint child', are also fabricated. According to literature, 'in the 3(rd) year of the Xianqing Period, Sun Simiao was invited by the emperor and lived in the deserted house of the Boyang Princess. He was more than 90 years old and did not have any visual or hearing loss … he was good to give lectures at various schools like Zhuang and Lao … in the Zhou Xuan Emperor Period Sun was tired of royal affairs and chose to be a hermit in the Taibai Mountain' (Tanghuiyao, Datang Xinyu, Tanbinlu). Sun Simiao should have been born in 560 AD. This time conformed to the time of his other events. He was 20 when a hermit and was 99 when he was invited by the Emperor Gaozong in the 3(rd) year of Xianqing."
23877884,Cochrane review: social skills groups for people aged 6 to 21 with autism spectrum disorders (ASD),Brian Reichow,"Background: Since autism was first described, major difficulties in social interaction have been a defining feature of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Social skills groups are a common intervention for individuals with ASD. Although a frequently recommended practice, the few studies that have addressed the efficacy of social skills groups have shown mixed results. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of social skills groups for improving social competence, social communication, and quality of life for people with ASD who are six to 21 years of age. Search methods: We searched the following databases in December 2011: CENTRAL (2011 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to November Week 3, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 50, 2011), PsycINFO (1887 to December Week 2, 2011), CINAHL (1937 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to current), OCLC WorldCat (12 December 2011), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 16 December 2011), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (20 December 2011). We also searched the reference lists of published papers. Selection criteria: Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing treatment (social skills groups) with a control group who were not receiving the treatment for participants aged six to 21 years with ASD. The control group could be no intervention, wait list, or treatment as usual. Outcomes sought were standardized measures of social competence, social communication, quality of life, emotion recognition, and any other specific behaviors. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected and appraised studies for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. All outcome data were continuous and standardized mean difference effect sizes (ES) with small sample correction were calculated. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis where possible. Main results: We included five RCTs evaluating the effects of social skills groups in 196 participants with ASD aged 6 to 21 years old. The results show there is some evidence that social skills groups improve overall social competence (ES = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.78, P = 0.003) and friendship quality (ES = 0.41, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.81, P = 0.04) for this population. No differences were found between treatment and control groups in relation to emotional recognition (ES = 0.34, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.88, P = 0.21) assessed in two studies or social communication as related to the understanding of idioms (ES = 0.05, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.72, P = 0.89), which was assessed in only one study. Two additional quality of life outcomes were evaluated, with results of single studies suggesting decreases in loneliness (ES = -0.66, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.17) but no effect on child or parental depression. No adverse events were reported. Given the nature of the intervention and the selected outcome measures, the risk of performance and detection bias are high. There is limited generalizability from the studies as they were all conducted in the US; they focused mainly on children aged 7 to 12, and the participants were all of average or above average intelligence. Authors' conclusions: There is some evidence that social skills groups can improve social competence for some children and adolescents with ASD. More research is needed to draw more robust conclusions, especially with respect to improvements in quality of life."
23876786,"BDNF val66met modulates the association between childhood trauma, cognitive and brain abnormalities in psychoses",Monica Aas,"Objective: Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is important for brain development and plasticity, and here we tested if the functional BDNF val66met variant modulates the association between high levels of childhood abuse, cognitive function, and brain abnormalities in psychoses. Method: 249 patients with a broad DSM-IV schizophrenia spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder were consecutively recruited to the TOP research study (mean±age: 30.7±10.9; gender: 49% males). History of childhood trauma was obtained using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Cognitive function was assessed through a standardized neuropsychological test battery. BDNF val66met was genotyped using standardized procedures. A sub-sample of n=106 Caucasians with a broad DSM-IV schizophrenia spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder (mean±age: 32.67±10.85; 49% males) had data on sMRI. Results: Carriers of the Methionine (met) allele exposed to high level of childhood abuse demonstrated significantly poorer cognitive functioning compared to homozygotic Valine (val/val) carriers. Taking in consideration multiple testing, using a more conservative p value, this was still shown for physical abuse and emotional abuse, as well as a trend level for sexual abuse. Further, met carriers exposed to high level of childhood sexual abuse showed reduced right hippocampal volume (r(2)=0.43; p=0.008), and larger right and left lateral ventricles (r(2)=0.37; p=0.002, and r(2)=0.27; p=0.009, respectively). Our findings were independent of age, gender, diagnosis and intracranial volume. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that in patients with psychoses, met carriers of the BDNF val66met with high level of childhood abuse have more cognitive and brain abnormalities than all other groups."
23876185,The performance of an online osteoporosis detection system a sensitivity and specificity analysis,Shu Fang Chang,"Aims and objectives: To develop an online system for the detection of osteoporosis risk and to test its accuracy. Background: Osteoporosis is a silent killer; usually, there are no symptoms, such as pain, until bone erosion and fracture occur. The risks of osteoporosis have been underestimated and neglected; as a result, osteoporosis can be as dangerous as heart diseases and cancers that lead to a healthcare crisis. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: The study participants were individuals presenting for routine health examinations at a medical centre in Taiwan from 2006-2007. Women over 30 years of age who underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning for measurement of bone mineral density were eligible for this study. The system for osteoporosis detection and health risk, which was developed in this study, was analysed. Results: The findings indicated a high sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 75%, positive predictive value of 75% and negative predictive value of 75%. In addition, the online osteoporosis detective system had a higher predictive power (24·2% vs. 11%) and a similar cut-off point (33% vs. 27%) compared with the tool designed by the International Osteoporosis Foundation. Conclusion: The online system for detection of osteoporosis risk had excellent reliability and validity. It performed well in predicting osteoporosis and the cut-off point used for identifying the risk among women at risk of developing osteoporosis. Therefore, it is suitable for the Asian women and can help women achieve the goals of early detection and health promotion. Relevance to clinical practice: Early detection is the only way to prevent osteoporosis. Professional nurses should apply effective technology to promote health care in community-dwelling people."
23876117,Heterogeneity of brain lesions in pediatric traumatic brain injury,Erin D Bigler,"Objective: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a method to identify and quantify abnormalities resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI). MRI abnormalities in children with TBI have not been fully characterized according to the frequency, location, and quantitative measurement of a range of pathologies critical for studies of neuropsychological outcome. Here, we report MRI findings from a large, multicenter study of childhood TBI, the Social Outcomes of Brain Injury in Kids (SOBIK) study, which compared qualitative and quantitative neuroimaging findings in 72 children with complicated mild-to-severe TBI to 52 children with orthopedic injury (OI). Method: Qualitative analyses of MRI scans coded white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), hemosiderin deposits reflecting prior hemorrhagic lesions, regions of encephalomalacia and/or atrophy, and corpus callosum atrophy and traumatic shear lesions. Two automated quantitative analyses were conducted: (a) FreeSurfer methods computed volumes for total brain, white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), corpus callosum, ventricles, amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and thalamus along with a ventricle-to-brain ratio (VBR); and (b) voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to identify WM, GM, and cerebrospinal fluid. We also examined performance on the Processing Speed Index (PSI) from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition, in relation to the above-mentioned neuroimaging variables. Results: WMHs, hemosiderin deposits, and focal areas of encephalomalacia or atrophy were common in children with TBI, were related to injury severity, and were mostly observed within a frontotemporal distribution. Quantitative analyses showed volumetric changes related to injury severity, especially ventricular enlargement and reduced corpus callosum volume. VBM demonstrated similar findings, but, in addition, GM reductions in the inferior frontal, basal forebrain region, especially in the severe TBI group. The complicated mild TBI group showed few differences from the OI group. PSI was significantly associated with global atrophy, as measured by VBR. Conclusion: MRI findings after childhood TBI are diverse and particularly influenced by injury severity, and they involve common features, group heterogeneity, and individual variability."
23875841,Older and (emotionally) smarter? Emotional intelligence as a mediator in the relationship between age and emotional labor strategies in service employees,Michael Sliter,"BACKGROUND/STUDY CONTEXT: The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether age was related to emotional labor strategies (surface and deep acting), and whether emotional intelligence partially explained this relationship. Additionally, employee well-being was examined as an outcome in this model. Methods: A total of 519 participants (age 18-68), working in a variety of service occupations, participated in a cross-sectional survey study. Validated measures for emotional intelligence, emotional labor strategies, positive affectivity, and employee well-being were administered. Results: A structural equation model supported the hypothesis that age was related positively to deep acting and negatively to surface acting, relationships partially mediated by emotional intelligence. Emotional labor strategy, in turn, affected well-being. Conclusion: Implications were discussed in employee selection and employee well-being, particularly in the customer service context. It is recommended that future research investigates how aging is related to emotional labor strategies in other occupations that have different emotional requirements (e.g., negative display rules)."
23875029,What are lay theories of social class?,Michael E W Varnum,"Numerous studies have documented the effects of social class on psychological and behavioral variables. However, lay beliefs about how social class affects these dimensions have not been systematically tested. Studies 1 and 2 assessed lay beliefs about the association between social class and 8 variables (including psychological and behavioral tendencies and cognitive ability). Study 3 assessed lay beliefs about the Big five personality traits and social class, and study 4 reframed the 8 variables from study 1 in opposite terms and yielded similar results. Study 5 contained the variables framed as in both studies 1 and 4, and replicated those results suggesting that framing effects were not responsible for the effects observed. Interestingly, for the most part lay beliefs about social class did not differ as a function of participants' own social class. In general people held relatively accurate and consistent stereotypes about the relationship between social class and well-being, health, intelligence, and neuroticism. In contrast lay beliefs regarding social class and reasoning styles, as well as relational, social, and emotional tendencies were less consistent and coherent. This work suggests that on the whole people's beliefs about social class are not particularly accurate, and further that in some domains there are contradictory stereotypes about the consequences of social class."
23874098,Reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortical hemodynamic response in adult obsessive-compulsive disorder as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy during the verbal fluency task,Rikuei Hirosawa,"Background: Near-infrared spectroscopy has helped our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of psychiatric disorders and has advantages including noninvasiveness, lower cost, and ease of use compared with other imaging techniques, like functional magnetic resonance imaging. The verbal fluency task is the most common and well established task used to assess cognitive activation during near-infrared spectroscopy. Recent functional neuroimaging studies have shown that the orbitofrontal cortex and other brain regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, may play important roles in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This study aimed to evaluate hemodynamic responses in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with OCD using near-infrared spectroscopy during the verbal fluency task and to compare these with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex responses in healthy controls. Methods: Twenty patients with OCD and 20 controls matched for age, gender, handedness, and estimated intelligence quotient participated in this study. The verbal fluency task was used to elicit near-infrared spectroscopic activation and consisted of a 30-second pre-task, followed by three repetitions of a 20-second verbal fluency task (total 60 seconds), followed by a 70-second post-task period. The near-infrared spectroscopy experiment was conducted on the same day as surveys of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression, and anxiety. Z-scores for changes in the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin were compared between the OCD patients and controls in 14 channels set over the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar areas. Results: During the verbal fluency task, significant task-related activation was detected in both the OCD group and the controls. Changes in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were significantly smaller in the OCD group than in the controls, but were not statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusion: Patients with OCD have reduced prefrontal, especially right dorsolateral prefrontal, cortical hemodynamic responses as measured by near-infrared spectroscopy during the verbal fluency task. These results support the hypothesis that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plays a role in the pathophysiology of OCD."
23874091,Associations between cognitive abilities and life satisfaction in the oldest-old. Results from the longitudinal population study Good Aging in Skåne,Asa Enkvist,"Introduction: Studies on the associations between cognitive abilities and life satisfaction (LS) in the oldest-old are few. The aim of this study was to explore whether abilities in six different cognitive domains could predict LS in the oldest-old 3 years later. Methods: The study population consisted of 681 individuals aged 78-98 years, drawn from the longitudinal population study ""Good Aging in Skåne,"" which is part of a national survey (The Swedish National Study on Aging and Care). Scores on 13 cognitive tests were related to scores on Neugartens' LS index A (LSI-A) 3 years later. The cognitive tests were added into six different cognitive domains. A multiple regression analysis was constructed for each cognitive domain separately, with scores on the LSI-A as the dependent variable. The model was adjusted stepwise for sex, age, education, functional capacity, and depressive mood. Results: Significant correlations were found between digit cancellation, word recall, verbal fluency (VF) A, VF animals, VF occupations, and mental rotations at baseline, as well as LSI-A at follow-up. The domains of spatial abilities (B = 0.453, P = 0.014) and processing speed (B = 0.118, P = 0.020) remained significantly associated with LSI-A 3 years later after adjustment. Conclusion: The cognitive domains of spatial abilities and processing speed predicted LS 3 years later in the oldest-old. Clinical implications are discussed."
23872536,Whole mitochondrial DNA variations in hippocampal surgical specimens and blood samples with high-throughput sequencing: a case of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis,Hulya Azakli,"Introduction: Hippocampal sclerosis is the most common lesion in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Recently, there has been growing evidence on the involvement of mitochondria also in sporadic forms of epilepsy. In addition, it has been increasingly argued that mitochondrial dysfunction has an important role in epileptogenesis and seizure generation in temporal lobe epilepsy. Although mtDNA polymorphisms have been identified as potential risk factors for neurological diseases, the link between homoplasmy and heteroplasmy within tissues is not clear. We investigated whether mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymorphisms are involved in a case report of a patient with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy-hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS). Design: We report the whole genome mtDNA deep sequencing results and clinical features of a 36-year-old woman with MTLE-HS. We used pyrosequencing technology to sequence a whole mitochondrial genome isolated from six different regions of her brain and blood. To assess the possible role of mitochondrial DNA variations in affected tissues, we compared all specimens from different regions of the hippocampus and blood. Results: In total, 35 homoplasmic and 18 heteroplasmic variations have been detected in 6 different regions of the hippocampus and in blood samples. While the samples did not display any difference in homoplasmic variations, it has been shown that hippocampus regions contain more heteroplasmic variations than blood. The number of heteroplasmic variations was highest in the CA2 region of the brain and accumulated in ND2, ND4 and ND5 genes. Also, dentate and subiculum regions of the hippocampus had similar heteroplasmic variation profiles. Discussion: We present a new rare example of parallel mutation at 16223 position. Our case suggests that defects in mitochondrial function might be underlying the pathogenesis of seizures in temporal lobe epilepsy."
23872342,Is executive function intact after pediatric intracranial hemorrhage? A sample of Mexican children with hemophilia,Guadalupe Morales,"The goal of this study was to examine executive functioning outcomes in children with hemophilia who have suffered intracranial hemorrhage. We assessed 10 boys with hemophilia with intracranial hemorrhage; 6 boys with hemophilia without intracranial hemorrhage; and 10 healthy boys as controls. Intellectual functioning was assessed with subscales from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Mexican Revision. Concept formation and reasoning, cognitive flexibility, and planning and organization domains from a neuropsychological assessment battery for Spanish-speaking children were employed for our analysis. Results indicated that children with intracranial hemorrhage demonstrated significant impairment on some measures of executive function compared with the control groups. All differences reflected poorer performance by the intracranial hemorrhage group. These results may reflect the impact of disruption to immature brain circuits and the deficiency of functional specificity within the immature brain. This is the only known study examining neuropsychological functioning in Mexican youth with hemophilia."
23872197,The influence of reading ability on subsequent changes in verbal IQ in the teenage years,Sue Ramsden,"Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is regularly used in both education and employment as a measure of cognitive ability. Although an individual's IQ is generally assumed to stay constant across the lifespan, a few studies have suggested that there may be substantial variation at the individual level. Motivated by previous reports that reading quality/quantity has a positive influence on vocabulary acquisition, we hypothesised that reading ability in the early teenage years might contribute to changes in verbal IQ (VIQ) over the next few years. We found that good readers were more likely to experience relative improvements in VIQ over time, with the reverse true for poor readers. These effects were largest when there was a discrepancy between Time 1 reading ability and Time 1 VIQ. In other words, VIQ increases tended to be greatest when reading ability was high relative to VIQ. Additional analyses supported these findings by showing that variance in VIQ change associated with Time 1 behaviour was also associated with independent measurements of brain structure. Our finding that reading in the early teenage years can predict a significant proportion of the variance in subsequent VIQ change has implications for targeted education in both home and school environments."
23870446,"A cross-battery, reference variable, confirmatory factor analytic investigation of the CHC taxonomy",Matthew R Reynolds,"The Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) taxonomy has been used to classify and describe human cognitive abilities. The ability factors derived from the CHC taxonomy are often assumed to be invariant across multiple populations and intelligence batteries, which is an important assumption for research and assessment. In this study, data from five different test batteries that were collected during separate Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-Second Edition (KABC-II; Kaufman & Kaufman, 2004) concurrent validity studies were factor-analyzed jointly. Because the KABC-II was administered to everyone in the validity studies, it was used as a reference battery to link the separate test batteries in a ""cross-battery"" confirmatory factor analysis. Some findings from this analysis were that CHC-based test classifications based on theory and prior research were straightforward and accurate, a first-order Fluid/Novel Reasoning (Gf) factor was equivalent to a second-order g factor, and sample heterogeneity related to SES and sex influenced factor loadings. It was also shown that a reference variable approach, used in studies that incorporate planned missingness into data collection, may be used successfully to analyze data from several test batteries and studies. One implication from these findings is that CHC theory should continue to serve as a useful guide that can be used for intelligence research, assessment, and test development."
23870280,National suicide rates and mental health system indicators: an ecological study of 191 countries,A P Rajkumar,"Purpose: The relative contributions of psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial stress to suicide, and the efficacy of mental health systems in reducing population suicide rates, are currently unclear. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate whether national suicide rates are associated with their corresponding mental health system indicators. Methods: Relevant data were retrieved from the following sources: the World Health Organization, the United Nations Statistics Division and the Central Intelligence Agency World Fact book. Suicide rates of 191 countries were compared with their mental health system indicators using an ecological study design and multivariate non-parametric robust regression models. Results: Significant positive correlations between suicide rates and mental health system indicators (p<0.001) were documented. After adjusting for the effects of major macroeconomic indices using multivariate analyses, numbers of psychiatrists (p=0.006) and mental health beds (p<0.001) were significantly positively associated with population suicide rates. Conclusions: Countries with better psychiatric services experience higher suicide rates. Although these associations should be interpreted with caution, as the issues are complex, we suggest that population-based public health strategies may have greater impact on national suicide rates than curative mental health services for individuals."
23868035,Study of a Tunisian population of children with learning disorders],Ines Hsairi Guidara,"Background: Learning disorders are increasingly a concern for Tunisians parents. These difficulties are divided into two groups: specific learning disabilities and non-specific learning disorders. Aim: Our work is part of a federated research project. Our aim is to determine the incidence, etiology and management of learning disorders in the region of Sfax. Methods: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study on a population of 304 children assessed by their teachers as having academic difficulty. A multidisciplinary assessment including a neurological examination, an assessment of score of intelligence and language assessment has been performed for 209 children. Results: Referring to our sample, learning disorders affect 21.3% of children in the region Sfax. The frequency of specific learning disorder is estimated at 10.3% (reading disorder 5.9%, dyscalculia 2.4%, reading disorder associated with dyscalculia 2%). Non-specific learning disorders were found in 11% of children. Etiologies in this group were dominated by mental retardation (2.1%), inappropriate education (2.3%). Conclusion: Our study revealed the high frequency of learning difficulties. It allows us to distinguish between specific learning disabilities and non specific learning disorders secondary to neurological or precarious socio-economic conditions. However, the profile and severity of specific learning disorders could not be studied due to the lack of standardized Arabic tests in Tunisia. In countries with a lack of professional and specialized unit care as in Tunisia, reading interventions in school should be proposed. Only children with remaining difficulties after this training will be sent to specialized professionals."
23866983,The impact of parent socio-economic status on executive functioning and cortical morphology in individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls,R A Yeo,"Background: Relatively lower executive functioning is characteristic of individuals with schizophrenia. As low socio-economic status (SES) early in life (i.e. parent SES) has been linked with lower executive skills in healthy children, we hypothesized that parental SES (pSES) would be more strongly related to executive functioning in individuals with schizophrenia than in controls and have a greater impact on prefrontal cortical morphology. Method: Healthy controls (n = 125) and individuals with schizophrenia (n = 102) completed tests assessing executive functioning and intelligence. The groups were matched on pSES, which was evaluated with the Hollingshead-Redlich scale. A principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted on 10 variables from six executive tests, yielding three specific components (fluency, planning and response inhibition). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to evaluate effects of pSES on gray matter (GM) concentration. Results: Lower pSES was associated with lower scores across the three executive functioning components, and a significant group by pSES interaction was observed such that low pSES, in particular, affected individuals with schizophrenia. These effects remained significant when intellectual ability, education and self-SES (sSES) were added as covariates. VBM revealed that lower pSES was associated with reduced GM volume in several anterior brain regions, especially the superior frontal gyrus, in patients but not in controls. Conclusions: These findings suggest that individuals with schizophrenia may be particularly vulnerable to the adverse impact of low pSES, in terms of both lower executive skills and reduced anterior GM volumes."
23866608,Intelligence and creativity changes induced by pathological growth of space-occupying cerebral lesion],A M Perfil'ev,"Creativity and intelligence changes depending on tumor localization in frontal or parietal cortex before surgical procedure in 24 patients in comparison with control group are studied. Brain damage-induced intelligence impairment and a decrease of fluency, flexibility of figural divergent thinking, and originality of verbal one without specificity of tumor localization were found. Intelligence decrease was more presented while performing of figural tasks and least of all in verbal ones. The left prefrontal brain damage induced a decrease of all components of intelligence and a trend to a decrease of verbal creativity and figural fluency. The right parietal brain lesion was more associated with a decline of divergent thinking originality."
23866247,Emotional intelligence and self-efficacy: effects on psychological well-being in college students,Hilda Costa,"The present paper examined the role of perceived emotional intelligence-EI- (measured by adaptations of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale - TMMS, Salovey, Mayer, Goldman, Turvey, & Palfai, 1995) as a predictor of life satisfaction and mental health. We explored the unique contribution of EI dimensions (Attention, Clarity and Repair) on individuals' psychological well-being, after controlling for the influence of general self-efficacy and socio-demographic variables (age, gender and culture). Data was collected from a sample of 1078 Spanish, Mexican, Portuguese and Brazilian undergraduate students (M(age) = 22.98; SD = 6.73) and analyzed using hierarchical multiple regressions. Results indicated that overall EI dimensions (especially Clarity and Repair) accounted for unique variance on psychological well-being above and beyond general self-efficacy and socio-demographic characteristics. These findings provide additional support for the validity of perceived EI, and suggests that EI components contribute to important well-being criteria independently from well-known constructs such as self-efficacy."
23866231,Social intelligence as a predictor of loneliness in the workplace,Fatos Silman,"The aim of this research is to examine the relationship between social intelligence and loneliness of academics in the workplace. This study involves 326 (149 female/177 male) academics employed in various universities in Turkey and North Cyprus. The age average of participants is 39.09 years. In this study, the Loneliness at Work Scale (LAWS) and Tromso Social Intelligence Scale (TSIS) have been utilized. The data were analyzed using multiple regression and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient analysis techniques. The findings showed that social information processing, social skills, and social awareness, which are the sub-dimensions of social intelligence, positively explained 26% of social deprivation. Social skills and social awareness positively explained 13% of social companionship. The findings also showed that the social information processing sub-dimension did not meaningfully explain social companionship."
23866206,Psychoticism and disruptive behavior can be also good predictors of school achievement,Carmen Flores-Mendoza,"The relations of Gf (Standard Progressive Matrices Raven), Gc (verbal scale of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Version), personality dimensions (Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Junior Version), and disruptive behavior (TDAH scale) with school achievement (measured by TDE test and PISA test) were investigated. Two samples of students (total N = 534) representing a broad range of socioeconomic status (SES) participated in this study. Path models were conducted. The results demonstrated that (1) in both samples no sex differences related to school achievement were found; (2) in the first sample, after controlling for age and SES differences, Gf and psychoticism predicted (.38 and -.13, respectively) school achievement (measured by TDE test); (3) in the second sample, after controlling for SES differences to which additional measures were administered, Gf and Gc positively predicted (.22 and .40, respectively) school achievement (measured by PISA test). In addition, psychoticism and disruptive behavior also predicted school performance (-.14 and -.28, respectively). Some theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
23865113,No genes for intelligence in the fluid genome,Mae-Wan Ho,"Revolution is brewing belatedly within the heartlands of the genetic determinist establishment still in denial about the fluid genome that makes identifying genes even for common disease well-nigh impossible. The fruitless hunt for intelligence genes serves to expose the poverty of an obsolete paradigm that is obstructing knowledge and preventing fruitful policies from being widely implemented. Genome-wide scans using state-of-the art technologies on extensive databases have failed to find a single gene for intelligence; instead, environment and maternal effects may account for most, if not all correlation among relatives, while identical twins diverge genetically and epigenetically throughout life. Abundant evidence points to the enormous potential for improving intellectual abilities (and health) through simple environmental and social interventions."
23864820,Research on an infectious disease transmission by flocking birds,Mingsheng Tang,"The swarm intelligence is becoming a hot topic. The flocking of birds is a natural phenomenon, which is formed and organized without central or external controls for some benefits (e.g., reduction of energy consummation). However, the flocking also has some negative effects on the human, as the infectious disease H7N9 will easily be transmited from the denser flocking birds to the human. Zombie-city model has been proposed to help analyzing and modeling the flocking birds and the artificial society. This paper focuses on the H7N9 virus transmission in the flocking birds and from the flocking birds to the human. And some interesting results have been shown: (1) only some simple rules could result in an emergence such as the flocking; (2) the minimum distance between birds could affect H7N9 virus transmission in the flocking birds and even affect the virus transmissions from the flocking birds to the human."
23862313,"Adverse childhood experiences, posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and emotional intelligence in partner aggression",Rachael M Swopes,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) has been linked to childhood abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and low emotional intelligence (EI). Relationships among adverse childhood experiences (ACE), PTSD symptoms, and partner aggression (i.e., generalized tendency to aggress toward one's partner) were assessed in 108 male IPV offenders. It was hypothesized that ACE is positively correlated with partner aggression, PTSD mediates the ACE-aggression relationship, and the ACE-PTSD-aggression mediation varies by selected EI facets. Results indicate that ACE has an indirect effect on partner aggression via PTSD and PTSD mediates the ACE-aggression link when emotional self-regulation is low and when intuition (vs. reason) is high. Trauma-exposed IPV offenders may benefit from comprehensive treatments focusing on PTSD symptoms, emotional control, and reasoning skills to reduce aggression."
23861723,Effect of Pilates training on alpha rhythm,Zhijie Bian,"In this study, the effect of Pilates training on the brain function was investigated through five case studies. Alpha rhythm changes during the Pilates training over the different regions and the whole brain were mainly analyzed, including power spectral density and global synchronization index (GSI). It was found that the neural network of the brain was more active, and the synchronization strength reduced in the frontal and temporal regions due to the Pilates training. These results supported that the Pilates training is very beneficial for improving brain function or intelligence. These findings maybe give us some line evidence to suggest that the Pilates training is very helpful for the intervention of brain degenerative diseases and cogitative dysfunction rehabilitation."
23861458,Neurodevelopmental and body composition outcomes in children with congenital hypothyroidism treated with high-dose initial replacement and close monitoring,Benjamin B Albert,"Background: Despite newborn screening and early levothyroxine replacement, there are continued reports of mild neurocognitive impairment in children with congenital hypothyroidism (CHT). In Auckland, New Zealand, cases are identified by a neonatal screening program with rapid institution of high-dose levothyroxine replacement (10-15 μg/kg·d), producing prompt normalization of thyroid function. Subsequently, frequent monitoring and dose alterations are performed for 2 years. We aimed to assess whether the Auckland treatment strategy prevents impairment of intellectual and motor development. Methods: This study encompassed all children with CHT born in 1993-2006 in Auckland and their siblings. Neurocognitive assessments included the following: 1) intelligence quotient via Weschler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence III or Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children IV; 2) Movement Assessment Battery for Children; and 3) Beery Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Results: Forty-four CHT cases and 53 sibling controls aged 9.6 ± 3.9 years were studied. Overall intelligence quotient was similar among CHT cases and controls (95.2 vs 98.6; P = .20), and there were also no differences in motor function. Severity of CHT did not influence outcome, but greater time to normalize free T4 was associated with worse motor balance. There were no differences in anthropometry or body composition between groups. Conclusions: These findings suggest that a strategy of rapidly identifying and treating infants with CHT using high-dose levothyroxine replacement is associated with normal intellectual and motor development. The subtle negative impact on motor function associated with time to normalize free T4 levels is consistent with benefit from rapid initial correction."
23860544,Teaching emotional intelligence to intensive care unit nurses and their general health: a randomized clinical trial,F Sharif,"Background: Emotion and how people manage it is an important part of personality that would immensely affect their health. Investigations showed that emotional intelligence is significantly related to and can predict psychological health. Objective: To determine the effect of teaching emotional intelligence to intensive care unit nurses on their general health. Methods: This randomized clinical trial (registered as IRCT201208022812N9) was conducted on 52 of 200 in intensive care unit nurses affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. They were recruited through purposeful convenience sampling and then randomly categorized into two groups. The intervention group members were trained in emotional intelligence. Bar-on emotional intelligence and Goldberg's general health questionnaires were administered to each participant before, immediately after, and one month after the intervention. Results: While the mean score of general health for the intervention group decreased from 25.4 before the intervention, to 18.1 immediately after the intervention and to 14.6 one month later, for the control group, it increased from 22.0, to 24.2 and to 26.5, respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion: Teaching emotional intelligence improved the general health of intensive care unit nurses."
23859669,Classification of intellectual disability using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children: Full Scale IQ or General Abilities Index?,Taylor A Koriakin,"Aim: We examined the implications of using the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) versus the General Abilities Index (GAI) for determination of intellectual disability using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children, fourth edition (WISC-IV). Method: Children referred for neuropsychological assessment (543 males, 290 females; mean age 10y 5mo, SD 2y 9mo, range 6-16y) were administered the WISC-IV and the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, second edition (ABAS-II). Results: GAI and FSIQ were highly correlated; however, fewer children were identified as having intellectual disability using GAI (n=159) than when using FSIQ (n=196). Although the 44 children classified as having intellectual disability based upon FSIQ (but not GAI) had significantly higher adaptive functioning scores than those meeting intellectual disability criteria based upon both FSIQ and GAI, mean adaptive scores still fell within the impaired range. FSIQ and GAI were comparable in predicting impairments in adaptive functioning. Interpretation: Using GAI rather than FSIQ in intellectual disability diagnostic decision-making resulted in fewer individuals being diagnosed with intellectual disability; however, the mean GAI of the disqualified individuals was at the upper end of criteria for intellectual impairment (standard score 75), and these individuals remained adaptively impaired. As GAI and FSIQ were similarly predictive of overall adaptive functioning, the use of GAI for intellectual disability diagnostic decision-making may be of limited value."
23859594,Alterations in frontostriatal pathways in children born very preterm,Emma G Duerden,"Aim: Children born very preterm (<32wks' gestation) are at risk of white matter injury, particularly in frontostriatal pathways that mediate executive functioning. However, it is unclear whether very preterm children without evidence of neonatal brain injury manifest long-term white matter microstructural differences once they reach school age and if this is related to cognitive impairments. Method: Twenty school-aged children born very preterm (11 males, nine females; mean age 8y 6mo, standard error [SE] 1.68mo, range 7y 7mo-9y 6mo; gestational age range 24-30wks, mean gestational age 26.9wks, SE 0.4wk; birthweight 988 g, SE 46 g, range 570-1424 g) without evidence of neonatal brain injury, and 20 sex- and age-matched term-born children (mean age 8y 4.8mo, SE 1.92mo; range 7y 2mo-9y-10.8mo) underwent neurodevelopmental assessment and diffusion tensor imaging. Results: Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were calculated within all white matter pathways and within frontostriatal projections. Children born preterm had decreased fractional anisotropy in the territories of the left external capsule, superior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Measures of intelligence were negatively correlated with frontostriatal fractional anisotropy only in males born preterm. Interpretation: Results indicate that very preterm-born children exhibit white matter disturbances that persist into middle childhood, with potential sex differences in the association between these white matter alterations and cognitive function."
23858268,Indian mental concepts on children and adolescents,Prabhat Sitholey,"Ancient Indian mental concepts of children and adolescents are very similar to the contemporary modern concepts. The ancient concepts were based on a very positive regard for the children's development, education and future independence, adult role and contribution to society. Children were wanted and considered precious. The children were categorized in to 4 different varnas based on their intelligence, abilities, merit and aptitude and educated accordingly, away from their home, at Gurukuls. They had universal right to education. Girls received attention equal to boys. The boys were expected to earn their livelihood, while the girls were expected to be homemakers. Graduation of the young person at the end of education and return to home marked the emancipation from adolescence. Children's physical and mental health and its disorders were given due attention. Aetiology and treatment of physical and mental disorders was in accordance with the overall scientific development of those times."
23857818,"Theory of mind in schizophrenia: correlation with clinical symptomatology, emotional recognition and ward behavior",Woo Kyeong Lee,"Introduction: Several studies have suggested the presence of a theory of mind (ToM) deficit in schizophrenic disorders. This study examined the relationship of emotion recognition, theory of mind, and ward behavior in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Fifty-five patients with chronic schizophrenia completed measures of emotion recognition, ToM, intelligence, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Nurse's Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE). Results: Theory of mind sum score correlated significantly with IQ, emotion recognition, and ward behavior. Ward behavior was linked to the duration of the illness, and even more so to theory of mind deficits. Theory of mind contributed a significant proportion of the amount of variance to explain social behavior on the ward. Discussion: Considering our study results, impaired theory of mind contributes significantly to the understanding of social competence in patients with schizophrenia."
23857635,Prospective memory deficits in euthymic bipolar disorder patients: a preliminary study,Jing-Jing Zhou,"Introduction: Prospective memory refers to the ability to remember to do something in the future. To date, little is known about prospective memory deficits in bipolar disorder (BD) in remission (euthymia). This study examined the nature and correlates of prospective memory in these patients. Methods: Forty-seven euthymic BD patients and 47 matched healthy controls formed the study sample. Socio-demographic and basic clinical characteristics, prospective memory (Cambridge Prospective Memory Test [CAMPROMPT]), retrospective memory (immediate Logical Memory subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scales-Revised [WMS-R]), IQ (Raven's Progressive Matrices) and executive functioning (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) were measured in all participants; patients' symptoms were rated with the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the 11-item Young Mania Rating Scale. Results: Patients performed significantly worse on time-based prospective memory compared to controls. Multivariate analyses revealed that patients' lower score on Raven's Progressive Matrices significantly contributed to poor performance on time-based prospective memory, whereas lower scores on WMS-R Logical Memory subtest contributed to poor performance on event-based prospective memory; in controls, lower education level and older age significantly contributed to poor performance on time-based and event-based prospective memory, respectively. Discussion: Prospective memory deficits persist in remitted BD patients suggesting that prospective memory impairment constitutes a trait deficit in BD."
23857518,Discordant transsexualism in male monozygotic twins: neuroanatomical and psychological differences,Tahiana Signorini Andreazza,One monozygotic male twin pair discordant for transsexualism is described. Both twins were interviewed and tested with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale battery for cognitive functions and they underwent magnetic resonance imaging to measure the volumes of specific cerebral structures. Interviews with the twins and their mother indicated no unusual medical or life history events that could have had a causal role in the emergence of the disorder. Both cognitive function testing and neuroimaging detected differences between the twins that could be related to unexplained epigenetic effects and exogenous hormone usage.
23857262,AmI and deployment considerations in AAL services provision for elderly independent living: the MonAMI project,Jorge L Falcó,"The MonAMI project aims to investigate the feasibility of the deployment of open platforms for Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) services provision based on Ambient Intelligence (AmI) and to test user acceptance and the usability of the services. Services were designed to provide support in the areas of environmental control, security, well-being and leisure. These services were installed and evaluated in a Spanish geriatric residence. The participants included elderly persons with disabilities, nursing home care givers and informal carers. The concept of the open platform proved to be satisfactory for the provision of the services in a context aware framework. Furthermore, the usability of the technology was viewed positively and the overall results indicate that this system has the potential to prolong independent living at home for elderly people with disabilities. Deployment was proven successful and awareness of open-platform AAL service delivery was raised in local communities throughout Europe."
23856241,Hypothesis on two different functionalities co-existing in frontal lobe of human brains,Jue Wang,"Human frontal lobe is a key area from where our cognition, memory and emotion display or function. In medical case study, there are patients with social dysfunctions, lack of passion or emotion as result of their frontal lobe damage caused by pathological changes, traumatic damage, and brain tumor remove operations. The syndrome of frontal lobe damage remains at large unanswered medically. From early stage of pregnancy, there exists lobe layers, nerve combine, and neurons synaptic, indicating a completion of growth of functionality inside frontal lobe. However, this completion of growth does not match the growth of human intelligence. Human infants only start and complete their cognition and memory functionality one full year after their birth which is marked by huge amount of neurons synaptic inside their frontal lobe, which is not part of a continual growth of originally developed functions. By reasoning on pathological changes of frontal lobe, a hypothesis was established that two individually functional mechanisms co-existed inside one frontal lobe. This neuron system is particularly for human beings."
23856116,Socio-technical systems and interaction design - 21st century relevance,Martin Maguire,"This paper focuses on the relationship between the socio-technical system and the user-technology interface. It looks at specific aspects of the organisational context such as multiple user roles, job change, work processes and workflows, technical infrastructure, and the challenges they present for the interaction designer. The implications of trends such as more mobile and flexible working, the use of social media, and the growth of the virtual organisation, are also considered. The paper also reviews rapidly evolving technologies such as pervasive systems and artificial intelligence, and the skills that workers will need to engage with them."
23855607,"Emotional intelligence, self-efficacy, and occupational therapy students' fieldwork performance",Lynne Andonian,"This study explored the relationship of emotional intelligence level and self-efficacy to fieldwork performance for occupational therapy students. Occupational therapy students (n = 199) from 36 occupational therapy programs in the United States completed the two surveys, the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test and the Student Confidence Questionnaire, during their professional Level 2 fieldwork placements. The surveys were compared to the Fieldwork Performance Evaluation for the Occupational Therapy Student completed by the fieldwork educators. Results showed that degree of emotional intelligence, having a choice in the fieldwork setting, and having professional experience in a related setting were positively correlated to Fieldwork Performance scores. Students' self-efficacy was not related to Fieldwork Performance scores. This suggests fostering students' emotional intelligence and capacity for accurate skill appraisal supports fieldwork success."
23855554,Programs as causal models: speculations on mental programs and mental representation,Nick Chater,"Judea Pearl has argued that counterfactuals and causality are central to intelligence, whether natural or artificial, and has helped create a rich mathematical and computational framework for formally analyzing causality. Here, we draw out connections between these notions and various current issues in cognitive science, including the nature of mental ""programs"" and mental representation. We argue that programs (consisting of algorithms and data structures) have a causal (counterfactual-supporting) structure; these counterfactuals can reveal the nature of mental representations. Programs can also provide a causal model of the external world. Such models are, we suggest, ubiquitous in perception, cognition, and language processing."
23855249,How automation helps steer the revenue cycle process,Phil Colpas,"If there's one aspect of healthcare that's omnipresent - that is connected in some way to virtually every component of the medical trade - it's the revenue cycle; and vendors' solutions to manage it are as varied as the experts we queried on this topic. The revenue cycle actually touches on nearly everything related to healthcare - from the time a patient books an appointment with a healthcare facility, until the patient and insurance company provide final payments for services rendered to the healthcare provider. Over the past several decades, software programs and computers have replaced ledger books and calculators. And while the goal of revenue cycle management (RCM) remains essentially the same, healthcare reform will make this process infinitely more complex, due to reduced reimbursements and the onset of ICD-10 in October 2014. Additionally, reimbursement will be tied to quality, rather than quantity. According to an Information Week article by Ken Terry, outsourcing of billing and collections continues to grow, ""because hospitals and physician groups are not very good at these non-core tasks."" Think writers and math: I know a great many writers, including yours truly, who possess truly weak math skills. Granted, both skills involve opposite brain hemispheres - different parts of the brain. But what may be even more important is the fact that math is not generally an integral component of the main function of writing. A similar situation exists in healthcare facilities; just replace writing with providing care for people. A 2012 Black Book Rankings survey states 96 percent of organizations are in the process of acquiring several crucial accountable care organization (ACO) data solutions, including clinical decision support, RCM, health information exchange (HIEs), electronic health records (EHRs), e-prescribing, data center security and storage solutions, business intelligence and care coordination management. So it's clear that RCM will continue to remain a top-of-mind issue as we see how healthcare reform plays out. Here's what our select group of experts had to say about how automation helps to steer the revenue cycle process."
23815296,Biomimicry of quorum sensing using bacterial lifecycle model,Ben Niu,"Background: Recent microbiologic studies have shown that quorum sensing mechanisms, which serve as one of the fundamental requirements for bacterial survival, exist widely in bacterial intra- and inter-species cell-cell communication. Many simulation models, inspired by the social behavior of natural organisms, are presented to provide new approaches for solving realistic optimization problems. Most of these simulation models follow population-based modelling approaches, where all the individuals are updated according to the same rules. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain the diversity of the population. Results: In this paper, we present a computational model termed LCM-QS, which simulates the bacterial quorum-sensing (QS) mechanism using an individual-based modelling approach under the framework of Agent-Environment-Rule (AER) scheme, i.e. bacterial lifecycle model (LCM). LCM-QS model can be classified into three main sub-models: chemotaxis with QS sub-model, reproduction and elimination sub-model and migration sub-model. The proposed model is used to not only imitate the bacterial evolution process at the single-cell level, but also concentrate on the study of bacterial macroscopic behaviour. Comparative experiments under four different scenarios have been conducted in an artificial 3-D environment with nutrients and noxious distribution. Detailed study on bacterial chemotatic processes with quorum sensing and without quorum sensing are compared. By using quorum sensing mechanisms, artificial bacteria working together can find the nutrient concentration (or global optimum) quickly in the artificial environment. Conclusions: Biomimicry of quorum sensing mechanisms using the lifecycle model allows the artificial bacteria endowed with the communication abilities, which are essential to obtain more valuable information to guide their search cooperatively towards the preferred nutrient concentrations. It can also provide an inspiration for designing new swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, which can be used for solving the real-world problems."
23850606,Spontaneous theta rhythm and working memory co-variation during child development,Elena I Rodriguez-Martinez,"The present study examines possible relationships between changes in electroencephalogram (EEG) power and in working memory (WM) due to brain maturation. Scores on the phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad and executive components of WM, measured by the Working Memory Test Battery for Children (WMTB-C), were correlated with the power spectral density (PSD) values on the spontaneous EEG from 1 to 46 Hz. In order to control for non-specific processes of visuomotor abilities, the reaction time (RT) variable was measured with an Oddball task. One hundred and sixty seven subjects (82 males and 85 females) between 6 and 26 years old participated in the study. Three minutes of spontaneous EEG were recorded. The WMTB-C and the Oddball task were also administered. The scores on each WM component increased and the RT in the Oddball decreased with age, while PSD values in the different frequencies decreased with age. Significant negative correlations between each of the components and the PSD were obtained. The maximal negative correlations were obtained in the theta (4-7 Hz) range. A bivariate linear model including theta PSD and RT explained most of the WM variance due to age. The results suggest that spontaneous EEG maturation is closely related to WM maturation, particularly in the theta range."
23850600,Impairments in proverb interpretation following focal frontal lobe lesions,Patrick Murphy,"The proverb interpretation task (PIT) is often used in clinical settings to evaluate frontal ""executive"" dysfunction. However, only a relatively small number of studies have investigated the relationship between frontal lobe lesions and performance on the PIT. We compared 52 patients with unselected focal frontal lobe lesions with 52 closely matched healthy controls on a proverb interpretation task. Participants also completed a battery of neuropsychological tests, including a fluid intelligence task (Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices). Lesions were firstly analysed according to a standard left/right sub-division. Secondly, a finer-grained analysis compared the performance of patients with medial, left lateral and right lateral lesions with healthy controls. Thirdly, a contrast of specific frontal subgroups compared the performance of patients with medial lesions with patients with lateral frontal lesions. The results showed that patients with left frontal lesions were significantly impaired on the PIT, while in patients with right frontal lesions the impairments approached significance. Medial frontal patients were the only frontal subgroup impaired on the PIT, relative to healthy controls and lateral frontal patients. Interestingly, an error analysis indicated that a significantly higher number of concrete responses were found in the left lateral subgroup compared to healthy controls. We found no correlation between scores on the PIT and on the fluid intelligence task. Overall our results suggest that specific regions of the frontal lobes contribute to the performance on the PIT."
23850535,On eukaryotic intelligence: signaling system's guidance in the evolution of multicellular organization,Pedro C Marijuán,"Communication with the environment is an essential characteristic of the living cell, even more when considering the origins and evolution of multicellularity. A number of changes and tinkering inventions were necessary in the evolutionary transition between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, which finally made possible the appearance of genuine multicellular organisms. In the study of this process, however, the transformations experimented by signaling systems themselves have been rarely object of analysis, obscured by other more conspicuous biological traits: incorporation of mitochondria, segregated nucleus, introns/exons, flagellum, membrane systems, etc. Herein a discussion of the main avenues of change from prokaryotic to eukaryotic signaling systems and a review of the signaling resources and strategies underlying multicellularity will be attempted. In the expansion of prokaryotic signaling systems, four main systemic resources were incorporated: molecular tools for detection of solutes, molecular tools for detection of solvent (Donnan effect), the apparatuses of cell-cycle control, and the combined system endocytosis/cytoskeleton. The multiple kinds of enlarged, mixed pathways that emerged made possible the eukaryotic revolution in morphological and physiological complexity. The massive incorporation of processing resources of electro-molecular nature, derived from the osmotic tools counteracting the Donnan effect, made also possible the organization of a computational tissue with huge information processing capabilities: the nervous system. In the central nervous systems of vertebrates, and particularly in humans, neurons have achieved both the highest level of molecular-signaling complexity and the highest degree of information-processing adaptability. Theoretically, it can be argued that there has been an accelerated pace of evolutionary change in eukaryotic signaling systems, beyond the other general novelties introduced by eukaryotic cells in their handling of DNA processes. Under signaling system's guidance, the whole processes of transcription, alternative splicing, mobile elements, and other elements of domain recombination have become closely intertwined and have propelled the differentiation capabilities of multicellular tissues and morphologies. An amazing variety of signaling and self-construction strategies have emerged out from the basic eukaryotic design of multicellular complexity, in millions and millions of new species evolved. This design can also be seen abstractly as a new kind of quasi-universal problem-solving 'engine' implemented at the biomolecular scale-providing the fundamentals of eukaryotic 'intelligence'. Analyzing in depth the problem-solving intelligence of eukaryotic cells would help to establish an integrative panorama of their information processing organization, and of their capability to handle the morphological and physiological complexity associated. Whether an informational updating of the venerable ""cell theory"" is feasible or not, becomes, at the time being - right in the middle of the massive data deluge/revolution from omic disciplines - a matter to careful consider."
23850533,Applying a multiobjective metaheuristic inspired by honey bees to phylogenetic inference,Sergio Santander-Jiménez,"The development of increasingly popular multiobjective metaheuristics has allowed bioinformaticians to deal with optimization problems in computational biology where multiple objective functions must be taken into account. One of the most relevant research topics that can benefit from these techniques is phylogenetic inference. Throughout the years, different researchers have proposed their own view about the reconstruction of ancestral evolutionary relationships among species. As a result, biologists often report different phylogenetic trees from a same dataset when considering distinct optimality principles. In this work, we detail a multiobjective swarm intelligence approach based on the novel Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for inferring phylogenies. The aim of this paper is to propose a complementary view of phylogenetics according to the maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood criteria, in order to generate a set of phylogenetic trees that represent a compromise between these principles. Experimental results on a variety of nucleotide data sets and statistical studies highlight the relevance of the proposal with regard to other multiobjective algorithms and state-of-the-art biological methods."
23850484,Assessment of motor behaviour in high-risk-infants at 3 months predicts motor and cognitive outcomes in 10 years old children,Toril Fjørtoft,"Background: The general movement assessment has mainly been used to identify children with cerebral palsy (CP). A detailed assessment of quality of infant motor repertoire using parts of the ""Assessment of Motor Repertoire - 3 to 5 Months"" which is based on Prechtl's general movement assessment can possibly identify later motor and cognitive problems in children without CP. Aims: This study aims to determine whether analysis of quality of infant motor repertoire has predictive value for motor and cognitive outcomes at age 10 in children at risk for later neurological impairment. Study design: A longitudinal study design was used. Subjects: Video-recordings of 40 ""neurologically high-risk"" infants at 14 weeks post-term age were analysed with respect to motor repertoire. Outcome measures: Fidgety movements were classified as present or absent. Quality of concurrent motor repertoire was classified as normal if smooth and fluent and abnormal if jerky, monotonous or stiff. Poor motor outcome was defined as a score ≤ 5th centile on the Movement-Assessment-Battery-2, while poor cognitive outcome as total IQ <85 on Wechsler Intelligence Scale-III. Results: Among the high-risk children with presence of fidgety movements, poor motor and/or cognitive outcome at 10 years was identified by abnormal concurrent motor repertoire at 14 weeks post-term age in 86% (95% CI: 0.60-0.96) of the children. On the other hand, 71% (95% CI: 0.47-0.87) of those with normal motor and cognitive outcomes were identified by presence of fidgety movements and normal motor repertoire. Conclusions: Assessment of quality of infant motor repertoire may be a valuable early clinical marker for later impaired motor and cognitive outcomes in high-risk children who do not develop CP."
23850341,Brain white matter damage in aging and cognitive ability in youth and older age,Maria Del C Valdés Hernández,"Cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) reflect accumulating white matter damage with aging and impair cognition. The role of childhood intelligence is rarely considered in associations between cognitive impairment and WMH. We studied community-dwelling older people all born in 1936, in whom IQ had been assessed at age 11 years. We assessed medical histories, current cognitive ability and quantified WMH on MR imaging. Among 634 participants, mean age 72.7 (SD 0.7), age 11 IQ was the strongest predictor of late life cognitive ability. After accounting for age 11 IQ, greater WMH load was significantly associated with lower late life general cognitive ability (β = -0.14, p < 0.01) and processing speed (β = -0.19, p < 0.001). WMH were also associated independently with lower age 11 IQ (β = -0.08, p < 0.05) and hypertension. In conclusion, having more WMH is significantly associated with lower cognitive ability, after accounting for prior ability, age 11IQ. Early-life IQ also influenced WMH in later life. Determining how lower IQ in youth leads to increasing brain damage with aging is important for future successful cognitive aging."
23849422,"Aging male bodies, health and the reproduction of age relations",Ilkka Pietilä,"This article explores the ways in which a group of male factory workers uses bodies as bases for hierarchical categorization of men by age in their talk of mundane aspects of their lives. Analysis of interviews about health (4 focus groups and 5 personal interviews) with Finnish working-class men under 40 years old shows that they portray age groups to which they do not belong as careless, even irresponsible toward health and its maintenance. As they categorize youth and old people by age, they leave themselves unmarked by it, providing no vocabulary to describe their own group. Despite their tendency to distance themselves particularly from old people, they also distinguish among older men by familiarity, providing relatively nuanced accounts of their fathers' aging. We discuss the marking of age groups in terms of social inequality and talk of fathers in terms of intergenerational relations. Even family ties among men of diverse ages involve ageism, which familiarity serves both to mitigate and to make less visible. This article documents the maintenance of age inequality in everyday, mundane behavior."
23848243,Development of metacognitive and emotional executive functions in children,Alfredo Ardila,"It has been proposed that two major components of executive functions can be distinguished: (1) one related to complex cognition (metacognition, such as planning, problem solving, etc.); (2) the other related to coordinating and controlling emotional behavior. Contemporary neuroimaging techniques have demonstrated that there are two distinct functional-anatomical networks within the prefrontal cortex: one associated with cognitive control and the other associated with value based decision making-each related to specific frontal-lobe areas. Metacognitive (but not emotional) executive functions have been demonstrated to be correlated with general intellectual level (intelligence). Research has shown that emotional executive functions (such as attention control) develop earlier in life (during the 1st year), before the development of metacognitive executive functions (such as planning and verbal fluency), which develop around the age of 3 and are correlated with the development of a grammatical language."
23847709,Listeria septicemia accompanied by central nervous system involvement in a patient with multiple myeloma and secondary diabetes,Rong Hu,"Patient: Female, 58 FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Listeria septicemia Symptoms: Nausea • vomitting • high fever • apathetic intelligence • repeated convulsion Medication: Levofloxacin Clinical Procedure: - Specialty: Hematology Objective: Rare disease. Background: Multiple myeloma is a hematological malignancy that frequently causes secondary diabetes due to chemotherapy using hormones and infection due to immunosuppression. Case reports: The patient was a 58-year-old woman with multiple myeloma and secondary diabetes complicated by listeria septicemia accompanied by central nervous system involvement. She initially received moxalactam and etimicin sulfate, but blood cultures detected Listeria monocytogenes. Levofloxacin was administered, but the symptoms did not improve. The patient ultimately died. Conclusions: Listeria septicemia accompanied by central nervous system involvement in a patient with multiple myeloma and secondary diabetes is a relatively rare disease. Prevention, timely diagnosis, and treatment are the key steps for improvement. Blood glucose level control is another important factor that should be considered in the prevention and treatment for Listeria monocytogenes infection."
23847570,"Reconsidering the evolution of brain, cognition, and behavior in birds and mammals",Romain Willemet,"Despite decades of research, some of the most basic issues concerning the extraordinarily complex brains and behavior of birds and mammals, such as the factors responsible for the diversity of brain size and composition, are still unclear. This is partly due to a number of conceptual and methodological issues. Determining species and group differences in brain composition requires accounting for the presence of taxon-cerebrotypes and the use of precise statistical methods. The role of allometry in determining brain variables should be revised. In particular, bird and mammalian brains appear to have evolved in response to a variety of selective pressures influencing both brain size and composition. ""Brain"" and ""cognition"" are indeed meta-variables, made up of the variables that are ecologically relevant and evolutionarily selected. External indicators of species differences in cognition and behavior are limited by the complexity of these differences. Indeed, behavioral differences between species and individuals are caused by cognitive and affective components. Although intra-species variability forms the basis of species evolution, some of the mechanisms underlying individual differences in brain and behavior appear to differ from those between species. While many issues have persisted over the years because of a lack of appropriate data or methods to test them; several fallacies, particularly those related to the human brain, reflect scientists' preconceptions. The theoretical framework on the evolution of brain, cognition, and behavior in birds and mammals should be reconsidered with these biases in mind."
23847569,The causes of variation in learning and behavior: why individual differences matter,Bruno Sauce,"IN A SEMINAL PAPER WRITTEN FIVE DECADES AGO, CRONBACH DISCUSSED THE TWO HIGHLY DISTINCT APPROACHES TO SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY: experimental and correlational. Today, although these two approaches are fruitfully implemented and embraced across some fields of psychology, this synergy is largely absent from other areas, such as in the study of learning and behavior. Both Tolman and Hull, in a rare case of agreement, stated that the correlational approach held little promise for the understanding of behavior. Interestingly, this dismissal of the study of individual differences was absent in the biologically oriented branches of behavior analysis, namely, behavioral genetics and ethology. Here we propose that the distinction between ""causation"" and ""causes of variation"" (with its origins in the field of genetics) reveals the potential value of the correlational approach in understanding the full complexity of learning and behavior. Although the experimental approach can illuminate the causal variables that modulate learning, the analysis of individual differences can elucidate how much and in which way variables interact to support variations in learning in complex natural environments. For example, understanding that a past experience with a stimulus influences its ""associability"" provides little insight into how individual predispositions interact to modulate this influence on associability. In this ""new"" light, we discuss examples from studies of individual differences in animals' performance in the Morris water maze and from our own work on individual differences in general intelligence in mice. These studies illustrate that, opposed to what Underwood famously suggested, studies of individual differences can do much more to psychology than merely providing preliminary indications of cause-effect relationships."
23847418,Visuomotor competencies and primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis in prepubertal aged children,Maria Esposito,"Background: Primary monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PMNE) is a common problem in the developmental ages; it is the involuntary loss of urine during the night in children older than 5 years of age. Several clinical observations have suggested an association between bedwetting and developmental delays in motricity, language development, learning disability, physical growth, and skeletal maturation. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the prevalence of fine motor coordination and visuomotor integration abnormalities in prepubertal children with PMNE. Methods: The study population included 31 children (16 males, 15 females; mean age 8.14 years ± 1.36 years), and the control group comprised 61 typical developing children (32 males, 29 females; mean age 8.03 years ± 1.44 years). The whole population underwent a clinical evaluation to assess total intelligence quotient level, visuomotor integration (VMI) skills, and motor coordination performance (using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, or M-ABC). Results: No significant differences between the two study groups were found for age (P = 0.725), gender (P = 0.886), z-body mass index (P = 0.149), or intellectual abilities (total intelligence quotient) (P = 0.163). The PMNE group showed a higher prevalence of borderline performance on M-ABC evaluation and in pathologic performance on VMI Total Task compared to controls (P < 0.001). No significant differences between the two study groups were found for pathologic performances on the M-ABC (P = 0.07), VMI Visual Task (P = 0.793), and VMI Motor Task (P = 0.213). Conclusion: Our findings pinpointed that PMNE should not be considered as a voiding disorder alone and, consequently, the children affected should be referred to specific rehabilitative programs that aim to improve motor coordination and visuomotor integration."
23846849,Diogenes syndrome or isolated syllogomania? Four heterogeneous clinical cases,Giovanni Zuliani,"Diogenes syndrome (DS) is an acquired behavioural disturbance more often affecting elderly patients, but possible in all ages. It is characterised by social withdrawal, extreme self and house neglect, tendency to hoard any kind of objects/rubbish (syllogomania), and rejection against external help for lack of concern about one's condition. It is considered infrequent, but with quite high mortality. DS might be divided into several forms including Active (the patient gathers objects outside and accumulates them inside his house), Passive (patient invaded by his own rubbish), ""à deux"" (DS sharing between two people), and ""under-threshold"" (DS ""blocked"" by precocious intervention). Four cases are here presented. In case 1 (passive DS) alcoholism and cognitive impairment could be trigger factors for DS, predisposed by a ""personality alteration"". In case 2 (active, ""à trois"") superimposed psychosis could be the trigger, borderline intelligence being the predisposing factor. In case 3 (active), fronto-parietal internal hyperostosis might support an organic aetiology. Finally, case 4 was an example of isolated syllogomania in patient with evolving Alzheimer's dementia. Despite being heterogeneous, our casuistry suggest that DS can develop in both sexes, is prevalent in geriatric age and often associated with cognitive impairment/psychiatric disturbances, which are not specific, nor sufficient to justify DS. Isolated syllogomania only shares the characteristic hoarding with DS; although cognitive impairment might be present, the other DS typical aspects (social isolation, help refusal, characterial aspects, personal hygiene neglect) are absent."
23846718,Creativity and technical innovation: spatial ability's unique role,Harrison J Kell,"In the late 1970s, 563 intellectually talented 13-year-olds (identified by the SAT as in the top 0.5% of ability) were assessed on spatial ability. More than 30 years later, the present study evaluated whether spatial ability provided incremental validity (beyond the SAT's mathematical and verbal reasoning subtests) for differentially predicting which of these individuals had patents and three classes of refereed publications. A two-step discriminant-function analysis revealed that the SAT subtests jointly accounted for 10.8% of the variance among these outcomes (p < .01); when spatial ability was added, an additional 7.6% was accounted for--a statistically significant increase (p < .01). The findings indicate that spatial ability has a unique role in the development of creativity, beyond the roles played by the abilities traditionally measured in educational selection, counseling, and industrial-organizational psychology. Spatial ability plays a key and unique role in structuring many important psychological phenomena and should be examined more broadly across the applied and basic psychological sciences."
23846137,Cognitive impairment and gray/white matter volume abnormalities in pediatric patients with Turner syndrome presenting with various karyotypes,Qiuling Zhao,"Aim: To investigate the association between cognitive impairment and gray/white matter volume abnormalities in pediatric patients with Turner syndrome (TS) presenting with various karyotypes. Methods: In the present study, 21 pediatric patients with TS and the 45,X karyotype, 24 pediatric patients with TS and other karyotypes, and 20 normal healthy controls, underwent the Wechsler intelligence test, behavioral testing, and a 3.0 T magnetic resonance (MR) scan. Whole-brain high-resolution T1-weighted images were processed with SPM8 software and analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM); differences in gray/white matter volume between the TS groups and healthy controls were compared using analysis of covariance. Results: Pediatric patients in both TS groups had significantly lower IQ scores compared to the normal controls (p<0.05). Furthermore, both TS groups scored significantly less than the normal controls in various composite tests of cognitive function, including verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between the two TS patient groups in terms of their scores for verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. However, they did display significant differences in the following tests: accuracy and reaction times in the executive control test, reaction times in the short-, middle-, and long-term attention test, and accuracy in the long-term attention test. Patients in the 45,X karyotype group displayed decreased gray matter volume in the bilateral cuneus, calcarine sulcus postcentral gyrus, right precuneus, superior parietal lobule, lingual gyrus, left precentral gyrus, and cingulate gyrus. However, gray matter volume was increased in the bilateral dorsal midbrain, orbital frontal gyrus, left insular lobe, superior temporal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, cerebellum, posterior insular lobe, right caudate nucleus, putamen, and temporal pole. Patients with TS with other karyotypes exhibited decreased gray matter volume in the left precuneus, cingulate gyrus, right postcentral gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, and cuneus; contrastingly, gray matter volume increased in both the epencephals, left caudate nucleus, superior temporal gyrus, right insular lobe, and temporal pole. All volume differences were statistically significant when compared with normal controls [familywise error (FWE)-corrected p<0.05]. With regard to the two TS groups, gray matter volume in the left hippocampus and left caudate nucleus was significantly decreased in the 45,X karyotype group compared to patients with TS with other karyotypes (FWE-corrected p<0.05); conversely, gray matter volume in the right supramarginal gyrus was increased in the 45,X karyotype group (FWE-corrected p<0.05). Conclusion: Pediatric patients with TS display a lower level of intelligence compared to healthy controls, this is complicated by verbal and non-verbal cognitive impairment. The neuropathological basis of such cognitive deficiencies may be as a result of abnormalities in gray matter development."
23845388,Social cognitive performance as a marker of positive psychotic symptoms in young people seeking help for mental health problems,Adam J Guastella,"Previous research has suggested that psychotic symptoms are associated with impairments in social cognition. However, there is limited research evaluating this association in the context of younger patients with a broad range of mental health problems. In the present study, we evaluated social cognitive performance in 115 treatment-seeking participants who presented to a youth mental health service with affective or psychotic disturbances. Participants completed symptom severity measures, a social cognition task (the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET)), and a standardised battery of neuropsychological tests. Analyses based on diagnostic groups showed that patients with psychotic illnesses (n=23) showed impaired performance on the RMET compared to patients with primarily bipolar (n=40) and depressive illnesses (n=52). Performance on the RMET was negatively correlated with positive and negative psychotic symptoms, but not affective and anxiety symptoms. Performance on the RMET also was the strongest concurrent predictor of positive psychotic symptoms in a regression model that also included predicted intelligence, demographic variables, and neurocognition. RMET performance did not, however, predict negative symptoms above tests of sustained attention and verbal learning, nor was performance associated with any other symptoms of mental illness. Social cognitive impairments may provide a valuable marker for the presence of positive psychotic symptoms in young people with mental illness. Additionally, these impairments may have a role in the aetiology and maintenance of psychotic symptoms. Research is now needed to establish the nature of the relationship between social cognition and psychotic symptoms across different facets of social cognition. Research is also needed to investigate whether targeted social cognition treatments reduce risk for the development of positive psychotic symptoms."
23845237,Cortical surface area and IQ in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) young adults,Jon Skranes,"Introduction: Quantitative MRI measurements have revealed abnormalities in cortical development in children born preterm with very-low-birth-weight (VLBW). These children also have increased risk of cognitive deficits that persist into adulthood. The aim of this study was to investigate cortical surface area in VLBW young adults at age 19 compared with controls and to see whether surface area change was associated with cognitive function in the VLBW group. Methods: Thirty-eight VLBW (BW ≤ 1500 g) and 59 control participants were included in the study. Cognitive function was assessed by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III. The MRI scanning was performed at 1.5 T, and for the morphometric analyses of cortical surface area the FreeSurfer software was used. Results: Reduction in cortical surface area was seen in ventrolateral prefrontal, temporal and parietal regions in the VLBW group. Intelligence quotient (IQ) scores were reduced and correlated with surface area reduction in superior and inferior frontal gyri, and in medial temporal and occipital regions in the VLBW group. Brodmann areas (BAs) included in the group differences and in the IQ correlation in the VLBW group were located to the inferior frontal gyrus (BA 11, 12, 44, 45, 47), isthmus (BA 25), the superior parietal (BA 7), the inferior temporal (BA 20) and the parahippocampal gyri (BA 28, 34, 35, 36, 37). The IQ indices that made the largest contribution to the associations between IQ and surface areal change in the VLBW group were the Working Memory and the Processing Speed indices. Conclusions: Our study indicates that permanent deviations in cortical surface area still present in adulthood may explain the increased prevalence of cognitive impairments in preterm born VLBW individuals."
23844659,Whole-exome sequencing expands the phenotype of Hunter syndrome,S M Nikkel,"Whole-exome sequencing (WES) has proven its utility in finding novel genes associated with rare conditions and its usefulness is being further demonstrated in expanding the phenotypes of well known diseases. We present here a family with a previously undiagnosed X-linked condition characterized by progressive restriction of joint range of motion, prominence of the supraorbital ridge, audiology issues and hernias. They had an average stature, normal occipitofrontal circumference and intelligence, absence of dysostosis multiplex and otherwise good health. A diagnosis of Hunter syndrome was determined using WES and further supported by biochemical investigations. The phenotype of this family does not correspond to either the severe or attenuated clinical subtypes of Hunter syndrome. As further atypical families are reported, this classification will need to be modified. Our findings highlight the utility of WES in expanding the recognized phenotypic spectrum of known syndromes."
23844384,Prediction of heavy metal removal by different liner materials from landfill leachate: modeling of experimental results using artificial intelligence technique,Nurdan Gamze Turan,"An intensive study has been made to see the performance of the different liner materials with bentonite on the removal efficiency of Cu(II) and Zn(II) from industrial leachate. An artificial neural network (ANN) was used to display the significant levels of the analyzed liner materials on the removal efficiency. The statistical analysis proves that the effect of natural zeolite was significant by a cubic spline model with a 99.93% removal efficiency. Optimization of liner materials was achieved by minimizing bentonite mixtures, which were costly, and maximizing Cu(II) and Zn(II) removal efficiency. The removal efficiencies were calculated as 45.07% and 48.19% for Cu(II) and Zn(II), respectively, when only bentonite was used as liner material. However, 60% of natural zeolite with 40% of bentonite combination was found to be the best for Cu(II) removal (95%), and 80% of vermiculite and pumice with 20% of bentonite combination was found to be the best for Zn(II) removal (61.24% and 65.09%). Similarly, 60% of natural zeolite with 40% of bentonite combination was found to be the best for Zn(II) removal (89.19%), and 80% of vermiculite and pumice with 20% of bentonite combination was found to be the best for Zn(II) removal (82.76% and 74.89%)."
23843472,The impact of neglect on initial adaptation to school,Jody Todd Manly,"This study examined the impact of child neglect during the first 4 years of life on adaptation to school during kindergarten and first grade in the context of neighborhood poverty (NP). Processes related to the development of school competencies were examined, including the mediational role of cognitive functioning and ego-resiliency (ER) in shaping children's school outcomes. A total of 170 low-income urban children were followed prospectively for 2 years (ages 4-6). Results indicated that neglected children had significantly lower scores on kindergarten classroom behavior and first-grade academic performance than nonneglected children. Children's cognitive performance at age 4, controlling for maternal intelligence quotient, mediated the relation between severity of neglect and children's behavior in kindergarten as well as their academic performance in first grade. Moreover, severity of neglect was related to children's ER at age 4. However, additional ecological adversity in the form of NP moderated the link between ER and classroom behavior, such that at lower levels of poverty, ER mediated the relation between severity of neglect and school adaptation. Conversely, when NP was extreme, the effects of ER were attenuated and ER ceased to predict behavioral performance in kindergarten. The implications of these findings for prevention and intervention are discussed."
23840865,The reading of components of diabetic retinopathy: an evolutionary approach for filtering normal digital fundus imaging in screening and population based studies,Hongying Lilian Tang,"In any diabetic retinopathy screening program, about two-thirds of patients have no retinopathy. However, on average, it takes a human expert about one and a half times longer to decide an image is normal than to recognize an abnormal case with obvious features. In this work, we present an automated system for filtering out normal cases to facilitate a more effective use of grading time. The key aim with any such tool is to achieve high sensitivity and specificity to ensure patients' safety and service efficiency. There are many challenges to overcome, given the variation of images and characteristics to identify. The system combines computed evidence obtained from various processing stages, including segmentation of candidate regions, classification and contextual analysis through Hidden Markov Models. Furthermore, evolutionary algorithms are employed to optimize the Hidden Markov Models, feature selection and heterogeneous ensemble classifiers. In order to evaluate its capability of identifying normal images across diverse populations, a population-oriented study was undertaken comparing the software's output to grading by humans. In addition, population based studies collect large numbers of images on subjects expected to have no abnormality. These studies expect timely and cost-effective grading. Altogether 9954 previously unseen images taken from various populations were tested. All test images were masked so the automated system had not been exposed to them before. This system was trained using image subregions taken from about 400 sample images. Sensitivities of 92.2% and specificities of 90.4% were achieved varying between populations and population clusters. Of all images the automated system decided to be normal, 98.2% were true normal when compared to the manual grading results. These results demonstrate scalability and strong potential of such an integrated computational intelligence system as an effective tool to assist a grading service."
23840595,Cognitive function in adult offspring of women with gestational diabetes--the role of glucose and other factors,Tine D Clausen,"Objective: We aimed to evaluate cognitive function in adult offspring of women with diet-treated gestational diabetes and to study potential associations with maternal glucose values. Materials and methods: In 2003-2005 cognitive function was assessed in a cohort of 18-27 year old offspring of women with diet-treated gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 153) and offspring from the background population (n = 118). The main outcome measure was global cognitive score derived from Raven's Progressive Matrices and three verbal subtests from the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale. Maternal fasting- and 2-hour blood glucose values from the diagnostic oral glucose tolerance test were used as exposure variables. Results: Offspring of women with gestational diabetes mellitus had a lower global cognitive score, than offspring from the background population (93.1 vs. 100.0, P<0.001). However, when adjusted for maternal age at delivery, parity, smoking during pregnancy, pre-pregnancy overweight, family social class, parental educational level, gender, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal complications and offspring age at follow-up, the difference was no longer statistically significant. Offspring global cognitive score decreased significantly with increasing maternal fasting glucose (β = -4.5, 95% CI -8.0 to -0.9, P = 0.01) and 2-hour glucose (β = -1.5, -2.9 to -0.2, P = 0.03) in univariate general linear models, but not when adjusted for family social class and parental educational level. Conclusions: Lower cognitive test scores in adult offspring of women with diet-treated gestational diabetes were explained by well known predictors of cognitive function, but not by maternal hyperglycaemia during pregnancy. We find it reassuring that mild intrauterine hyperglycaemia does not seem to have adverse effect on offspring cognitive function."
23840450,Group Size Predicts Social but Not Nonsocial Cognition in Lemurs,Evan L Maclean,"The social intelligence hypothesis suggests that living in large social networks was the primary selective pressure for the evolution of complex cognition in primates. This hypothesis is supported by comparative studies demonstrating a positive relationship between social group size and relative brain size across primates. However, the relationship between brain size and cognition remains equivocal. Moreover, there have been no experimental studies directly testing the association between group size and cognition across primates. We tested the social intelligence hypothesis by comparing 6 primate species (total N = 96) characterized by different group sizes on two cognitive tasks. Here, we show that a species' typical social group size predicts performance on cognitive measures of social cognition, but not a nonsocial measure of inhibitory control. We also show that a species' mean brain size (in absolute or relative terms) does not predict performance on either task in these species. These data provide evidence for a relationship between group size and social cognition in primates, and reveal the potential for cognitive evolution without concomitant changes in brain size. Furthermore our results underscore the need for more empirical studies of animal cognition, which have the power to reveal species differences in cognition not detectable by proxy variables, such as brain size."
23840054,Measuring cognitive change in subjects with prodromal Alzheimer's disease,T Mura,"Objective: To investigate the sensitivity of a large set of neuropsychological tests to detect cognitive changes due to prodromal Alzheimer's disease(AD); to compare their metrological properties in order to select a restricted number of these tests for the longitudinal follow-up of subjects with prodromal AD. Participants: 212 patients with mild cognitive impairment were tested at baseline by a standardised neuropsychological battery, which included: the Free and Cued Selective Reminding test (FCSRT), the Benton Visual Retention test, the Deno100, verbal fluency, a serial digit learning test, the double task of Baddeley, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) similarities, the Trail-Making Test and the WAIS digit symbol test. Patients were monitored every 6 months for up to 3 years in order to identify those who converted to AD (retrospectively classified as prodromal AD). Statistical analyses were performed using a nonlinear multivariate mixed model involving a latent process. This model assumes that the psychometric tests are nonlinear transformations of a common latent cognitive process, and it captures the metrological properties of tests. Results: 57 patients converted to AD. The most sensitive tests in the detection of cognitive changes due to prodromal AD were the FCSRT, the semantic verbal fluency and the Deno100. Some tests exhibited a higher sensitivity to cognitive changes for subjects with high levels of cognition, such as the free recall, delayed free recall scores of the FCSRT and the semantic verbal fluency, whereas others showed a higher sensitivity at low levels of cognition, such as the total recall score of the FCSRT. Conclusions: Tests used for the follow-up of prodromal AD subjects should be chosen among those that actually decline in this stage of the disease and should be selected according to the subject's initial scores."
23836001,Altruistic aptitude: age-dependent influence of temperament and emotional intelligence,Mieczyslaw Pokorski,"It is unclear why some people behave altruistically and others do not. This study seeks to determine what psychological features could help predict altruistic behavior. We addressed the issue by examining distinct dimensions of temperament and emotional intelligence and their associations with the level of proaltruistic aptitude in two distant age-groups, young (20-29 years) and senior (60-79 years) persons. The study was one of a self-reported psychometric survey. The major findings were that emotional intelligence, rather than temperament, is strongly associated with the expression of altruistic behavior in both young and senior subjects, despite a general decrease in the characteristics of emotional intelligence in advanced age. We also failed to substantiate the presence of an appreciable difference in the level of declared altruism between the senior and young subjects. High emotional intelligence, often underling social engagement and bonding, seems thus a good predictor of altruistic aptitude to be displayed by a person. The independence of this association of age-changes in emotional agility is suggestive of causal relationship. The study is relevant for an understanding of the enigmatic origins of important social behaviors like altruism."
23835288,Twin-singleton differences in cognitive abilities in a sample of Africans in Nigeria,Yoon-Mi Hur,"Recent studies comparing cognitive abilities between contemporary twins and singletons in developed countries have suggested that twin deficits in cognitive abilities no longer exist. We examined cognitive abilities in a sample of twins and singletons born recently in Nigeria to determine whether recent findings can be replicated in developing countries. Our sample consisted of 413 pairs of twins and 280 singletons collected from over 45 public schools in Abuja and its neighboring states in Nigeria. The ages of twins and singletons ranged from 9 to 20 years with a mean (SD) of 14.6 years (2.2 years) for twins and 16.1 years (1.8 years) for singletons. Zygosity of the same-sex twins was determined by analysis of 16 deoxyribonucleic acid markers. We asked participants to complete a questionnaire booklet that included Standard Progressive Matrices-Plus Version (SPM+), Mill-Hill Vocabulary Scale (MHV), Family Assets Questionnaire, and demographic questions. The data were corrected for sex and age and then analyzed using maximum likelihood model-fitting analysis. Although twins and singletons were comparable in family social class indicators, singletons did better than twins across all the tests (d = 0.10 to 0.35). The average of d for SPM+ total [0.32; equivalent to 4.8 Intelligence Quotient (IQ) points] and d for MHV (0.24; equivalent to 3.6 IQ points) was 0.28 (equivalent to 4.2 IQ points), similar to the twin-singleton gap found in old cohorts in developed countries. We speculate that malnutrition, poor health, and educational systems in Nigeria may explain the persistence of twin deficits in cognitive abilities found in our sample."
23835081,Measured emotional intelligence ability and grade point average in nursing students,Estelle Codier,"Background: For most schools of nursing, grade point average is the most important criteria for admission to nursing school and constitutes the main indicator of success throughout the nursing program. In the general research literature, the relationship between traditional measures of academic success, such as grade point average and postgraduation job performance is not well established. In both the general population and among practicing nurses, measured emotional intelligence ability correlates with both performance and other important professional indicators postgraduation. Little research exists comparing traditional measures of intelligence with measured emotional intelligence prior to graduation, and none in the student nurse population. Objective: This exploratory, descriptive, quantitative study was undertaken to explore the relationship between measured emotional intelligence ability and grade point average of first year nursing students. Design setting and sample: The study took place at a school of nursing at a university in the south central region of the United States. Participants included 72 undergraduate student nurse volunteers. Methods: Emotional intelligence was measured using the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test, version 2, an instrument for quantifying emotional intelligence ability. Pre-admission grade point average was reported by the school records department. Results: Total emotional intelligence (r=.24) scores and one subscore, experiential emotional intelligence(r=.25) correlated significantly (>.05) with grade point average. Conclusions: This exploratory, descriptive study provided evidence for some relationship between GPA and measured emotional intelligence ability, but also demonstrated lower than average range scores in several emotional intelligence scores. The relationship between pre-graduation measures of success and level of performance postgraduation deserves further exploration. The findings of this study suggest that research on the relationship between traditional and nontraditional measures of academic success, and emotional intelligence correlation with postgraduation performance, is warranted."
23834706,Circadian typology and emotional intelligence in healthy adults,Juan Manuel Antúnez,"Several aspects related to health, such as satisfaction with life, perceived well-being, and psychopathological symptomatology have been associated with circadian typology and with emotional intelligence. Nevertheless, the relationships between circadian typology and emotional intelligence have not been explored yet. The purpose of the present study is to examine the relationships between circadian typology and emotional intelligence, taking into account the possible interactions between sex and physical exercise, and controlling for age. A sample of 1011 participants (649 women), aged between 18 and 50 yrs (26.92 ± 6.53) completed the reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ) and the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 (TMMS-24). The TMMS-24 considers three dimensions of emotional intelligence: emotional attention, emotional clarity, and emotional repair. Women showed higher values for emotional attention, whereas men showed higher values for emotional repair (p < 0.035, in both cases). Subjects who do physical exercise weekly showed higher values for emotional repair (p = 0.001) regardless of circadian typology or sex. Circadian typology presents differences in all scores of emotional intelligence dimensions. Morning-type had lower emotional attention than evening- and neither-type; neither-type had lower emotional repair than morning-type, and lower emotional clarity than both evening- and morning-type (p < 0.046, in all cases). Moreover, circadian typology modulated the sex differences in emotional attention, and only morning-type men showed a low emotional attention score. From the results of emotional intelligence we can conclude that morning typology may be a protective factor in terms of general health, whereas we should be aware that the neither-type may present a possible vulnerability to develop psychological problems."
23834009,A contemporary view of genes and behavior: complex systems and interactions,Douglas Wahlsten,"Several large-scale searches for genes that influence complex human traits, such as intelligence and personality, in the normal range of variation have failed to identify even one gene that makes a significant difference. All previously published claims for genetic influences of this kind now appear to have been false positives. For more serious psychiatric and medical disorders such as schizophrenia and autism, several genes have been found where a rare mutation contributes to abnormal behavior, but in many instances they are de novo mutations not obtained from a parent. Despite the many disappointments in the search for genes influencing human behavior, the field of molecular genetics has made remarkable progress to the extent that several broadly applicable principles can now be affirmed. These principles show how development is regulated by networks of interacting genes that function in an environmental context. They invalidate several key assumptions of statistical genetic analysis that are made when estimating heritability. There is now a need to reform the teaching of genetics to our students and to restrict the funding of further searches for elusive genes that account for so little variance in normal behaviors."
23833881,Is intelligence enhanced by letter priming? A failure to replicate the results of Ciani and Sheldon (2010),Sean P Carlin,"Previous research has suggested that motivational processes outside an individual's conscious awareness may be primed so as to enhance or impair cognitive performance. The present study involved a conceptual replication of the 2010 study of Ciani and Sheldon (Experiments 1 and 2), employing the same materials and task, to test whether exposure to the letter A before an analogies test improved performance and the letter F impaired it, relative to the neutral letter J. It also examined the effect of pre-exposing participants before testing to a positive or negative verbal passage concerning letter grades. Priming was not found to have any effect: the participants (N = 116), under both pre-exposure conditions, gave analogies scores which were virtually identical whether they had been primed with A, F, or J, thus contradicting the previous results. It is concluded that there is a pressing need for more replications of priming experiments as well as other studies."
23832868,Development of high-content assays for kidney progenitor cell expansion in transgenic zebrafish,Subramaniam Sanker,"Reactivation of genes normally expressed during organogenesis is a characteristic of kidney regeneration. Enhancing this reactivation could potentially be a therapeutic target to augment kidney regeneration. The inductive events that drive kidney organogenesis in zebrafish are similar to the initial steps in mammalian kidney organogenesis. Therefore, quantifying embryonic signals that drive zebrafish kidney development is an attractive strategy for the discovery of potential novel therapeutic modalities that accelerate kidney regeneration. The Lim1 homeobox protein, Lhx1, is a marker of kidney development that is also expressed in the regenerating kidneys after injury. Using a fluorescent Lhx1a-EGFP transgene whose phenotype faithfully recapitulates that of the endogenous protein, we developed a high-content assay for Lhx1a-EGFP expression in transgenic zebrafish embryos employing an artificial intelligence-based image analysis method termed cognition network technology (CNT). Implementation of the CNT assay on high-content readers enabled automated real-time in vivo time-course, dose-response, and variability studies in the developing embryo. The Lhx1a assay was complemented with a kidney-specific secondary CNT assay that enables direct measurements of the embryonic renal tubule cell population. The integration of fluorescent transgenic zebrafish embryos with automated imaging and artificial intelligence-based image analysis provides an in vivo analysis system for structure-activity relationship studies and de novo discovery of novel agents that augment innate regenerative processes."
23831513,Neonatal presentation of chromosome 9q33.2-q34.3 duplication,Alexandra Moody,"Partial terminal duplication of chromosome 9 is a rare anomaly that is known to be associated with specific dysmorphic features. While having common characteristics, these patients also have inconsistent phenotypic features. These inconsistent features may be attributed to the length and the region of the duplicated segment of chromosome 9. We discuss a case of an infant with similar physical features to those previously reported including dysmorphology of the craniofacial region, hands and feet. However we also describe findings of malrotation and renal anomalies. Microarray demonstrated duplication of 9q33.2-q34.3 with normal parental karyotyping. This is the first reported case of duplication of this specific region of chromosome 9q and the phenotypic presentation represents a new constellation of clinical findings."
23831334,The use of stimulant medication to improve neurocognitive and learning outcomes in children diagnosed with brain tumours: a systematic review,Emilie F Smithson,"Purpose: Impaired attention is reported in children following treatment for brain tumours (BT). Attention problems impact on information processing and encoding, ultimately leading to academic under-performance. Having been successfully used to manage attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), stimulants such as methylphenidate (MPH) have been investigated as a beneficial treatment for survivors of childhood BT. In order to develop appropriate strategies to manage late neurocognitive effects, the results of such trials should be evaluated to identify those children most likely to benefit from stimulants. Design: An advanced search was performed across twelve electronic databases for the selection of relevant randomised controlled trials with at least one active stimulant-treated arm. Abstracts were screened for eligibility and data on study design and results were extracted. Results: Of the 5446 records identified, 11 full text articles were assessed for eligibility and seven included in qualitative synthesis. Of the seven papers there were four original trials. Short term outcomes for MPH on objective direct measures of attention and parent/teacher ratings of behaviour were favourable. Observations of side effects indicate that MPH is generally well tolerated. Heterogeneity of study design and outcome measures precluded meta-analysis. Conclusion: Despite yielding only a small number of trials with limited sample size, studies investigating the use of stimulant medication in survivors of childhood BT have provided promising outcomes. Current evidence indicates males, older age when treated, and higher baseline intelligence quotient (IQ) were predictive of greater responsiveness to MPH. While encouraging, additional research using a standardised protocol of outcome measures would be beneficial in identifying those likely to benefit from stimulant use. Further, the available data have yet to establish clear evidence for the effectiveness of MPH being translated into improvements on standardised measures of academic achievement."
23830215,Neuropsychological assessment of memory in child and adolescent first episode psychosis: cannabis and «the paradox effect»,Josefa María Moreno-Granados,"Introduction: The importance of neuropsychological functioning in First-Episode Psychosis (FEP) has led to the publication of a growing number of studies in this area of research. The present study pursued three goals: First, to examine verbal and visual memory in a sample of Child and Adolescent FEP, second, to evaluate the effect of other cognitive domains on verbal and visual memory, and finally, to examine the relationship between performance in this cognitive dimension and the use of cannabis at this age. Method: A sample of 41 FEPs and 39 healthy subjects were evaluated. The variables assessed were verbal and visual memory, attention, working memory, processing speed, mental flexibility, verbal fluency, motor coordination, planning ability and intelligence. Results: Our results found impairment of short and long-term recall of verbal memory, and short-term visual memory in early psychosis. They also found relationships between cognitive dimensions, such as visual memory and intelligence and motor coordination. Finally, a «paradoxical» effect was found in patients who used cannabis, as the FEP consumers performed the visual memory test better than those who had not used it. Conclusions: Patients showed impairment of short and long-term recall of verbal information and short-term visual reproduction. In the second place, motor coordination and intelligence influenced short-term visual memory in patients in the early stages of the illness. Third, use of cannabis in patients with FEP was associated with better performance in the test that evaluated the short-term visual memory, as measured by task completion time, that is, efficiency in performing the test. However, when measured by task execution accuracy, their visual memory was no better than the controls."
23829133,Motor and cognitive performance of overweight preschool children,Heinz Krombholz,"Gross and fine motor skills and cognitive performance in obese and overweight children were compared to healthy weight children. Participants were 1,543 children (797 boys and 746 girls) ages 43 to 84 months, attending childcare centers in Munich, Germany. According to German Body Mass Index (BMI) standards for age and sex, 4.6% of the children were classified as obese (percentile greater or equal 97), 6.8% as overweight (percentile greater or equal 90 and less than 97), 5.9% as underweight (percentile less than 10), and 83.1% as being of healthy weight. Dependent variables were physical characteristics (height, weight, skinfold thickness), physical fitness (standing broad jump, shuttle run, hanging), body coordination (balancing forward, balancing backward, lateral jump, hopping), manual dexterity (right and left hand), and cognitive performance (intelligence, verbal ability, concentration). Higher proportions of children from lower socioeconomic and immigrant backgrounds were overweight. There was no association between weight and sex. Overweight children showed lower performance on gross motor skills (coordination and fitness), manual dexterity, and intelligence compared to healthy weight children, even after controlling for the effects of social class and immigration status."
23827881,Modification of neurobehavioral effects of mercury by genetic polymorphisms of metallothionein in children,James S Woods,"Mercury (Hg) is neurotoxic, and children may be particularly susceptible to this effect. A current major challenge is the identification of children who may be uniquely susceptible to Hg toxicity because of genetic disposition. We examined the hypothesis that genetic variants of metallothionein (MT) that are reported to affect Hg toxicokinetics in adults would modify the neurotoxic effects of Hg in children. Five hundred seven children, 8-12 years of age at baseline, participated in a clinical trial to evaluate the neurobehavioral effects of Hg from dental amalgam tooth fillings. Subjects were evaluated at baseline and at 7 subsequent annual intervals for neurobehavioral performance and urinary Hg levels. Following the completion of the clinical trial, we performed genotyping assays for variants of MT isoforms MT1M (rs2270837) and MT2A (rs10636) on biological samples provided by 330 of the trial participants. Regression modeling strategies were employed to evaluate associations between allelic status, Hg exposure, and neurobehavioral test outcomes. Among girls, few significant interactions or independent main effects for Hg exposure and either of the MT gene variants were observed. In contrast, among boys, numerous significant interaction effects between variants of MT1M and MT2A, alone and combined, with Hg exposure were observed spanning multiple domains of neurobehavioral function. All dose-response associations between Hg exposure and test performance were restricted to boys and were in the direction of impaired performance. These findings suggest increased susceptibility to the adverse neurobehavioral effects of Hg among children with relatively common genetic variants of MT, and may have important public health implications for future strategies aimed at protecting children and adolescents from the potential health risks associated with Hg exposure. We note that because urinary Hg reflects a composite exposure index that cannot be attributed to a specific source, these findings do not support an association between Hg in dental amalgams specifically and the adverse neurobehavioral outcomes observed."
23827387,"What we are watching--five top global infectious disease threats, 2012: a perspective from CDC's Global Disease Detection Operations Center",Kira A Christian,"Disease outbreaks of international public health importance continue to occur regularly; detecting and tracking significant new public health threats in countries that cannot or might not report such events to the global health community is a challenge. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Global Disease Detection (GDD) Operations Center, established in early 2007, monitors infectious and non-infectious public health events to identify new or unexplained global public health threats and better position CDC to respond, if public health assistance is requested or required. At any one time, the GDD Operations Center actively monitors approximately 30-40 such public health threats; here we provide our perspective on five of the top global infectious disease threats that we were watching in 2012: 1 avian influenza A (H5N1), 2 cholera, 3 wild poliovirus, 4 enterovirus-71, and 5 extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis11†Current address: Division of Integrated Biosurveillance, Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center, US Department of Defense, Silver Spring, MD, USA."
23826633,A physical education trial improves adolescents' cognitive performance and academic achievement: the EDUFIT study,D N Ardoy,"To analyze the effects of an intervention focused on increasing the time and intensity of Physical Education (PE), on adolescents' cognitive performance and academic achievement. A 4-month group-randomized controlled trial was conducted in 67 adolescents from South-East Spain, 2007. Three classes were randomly allocated into control group (CG), experimental group 1 (EG1) and experimental group 2 (EG2). CG received usual PE (two sessions/week), EG1 received four PE sessions/week and EG2 received four PE sessions/week of high intensity. Cognitive performance (non-verbal and verbal ability, abstract reasoning, spatial ability, verbal reasoning and numerical ability) was assessed by the Spanish Overall and Factorial Intelligence Test, and academic achievement by school grades. All the cognitive performance variables, except verbal reasoning, increased more in EG2 than in CG (all P < 0.05). Average school grades (e.g., mathematics) increased more in EG2 than in CG. Overall, EG2 improved more than EG1, without differences between EG1 and CG. Increased PE can benefit cognitive performance and academic achievement. This study contributes to the current knowledge by suggesting that the intensity of PE sessions might play a role in the positive effect of physical activity on cognition and academic success. Future studies involving larger sample sizes should confirm or contrast these preliminary findings."
23826090,Factors influencing adult physical health after controlling for current health conditions: evidence from a british cohort,Helen Cheng,"This study explored a longitudinal data set of 6875 British adults examining the effects of parental social status (measured at birth), cognitive ability (at age 11 yrs), personality traits, education and occupational attainment on physical health and functioning (all measured at age 50 yrs), after taking account of current health conditions (number of illness). Correlation analysis showed that parental social class, childhood cognitive ability, education and occupation, and two personality traits (Emotional Stability/Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness) were all significantly associated with adult physical health variables. Structural equation modelling showed that health conditions and personality traits were significantly, and inversely, associated with physical health (indicated by good daily physical functioning, relative absence of pain, perceived health, and low level of limitations at work due to physical health). Parental social status, childhood intelligence, educational and occupational attainment were all modestly, but significantly and directly, associated with adult physical health. The effect of childhood intelligence on adult physical health was, in part, mediated through Emotional Stability and Conscientiousness. After controlling for health conditions Emotional Stability was the strongest predictor of physical health. Implications and limitations are discussed."
23825884,The relationship between intelligence and creativity: New support for the threshold hypothesis by means of empirical breakpoint detection,Emanuel Jauk,"The relationship between intelligence and creativity has been subject to empirical research for decades. Nevertheless, there is yet no consensus on how these constructs are related. One of the most prominent notions concerning the interplay between intelligence and creativity is the threshold hypothesis, which assumes that above-average intelligence represents a necessary condition for high-level creativity. While earlier research mostly supported the threshold hypothesis, it has come under fire in recent investigations. The threshold hypothesis is commonly investigated by splitting a sample at a given threshold (e.g., at 120 IQ points) and estimating separate correlations for lower and upper IQ ranges. However, there is no compelling reason why the threshold should be fixed at an IQ of 120, and to date, no attempts have been made to detect the threshold empirically. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between intelligence and different indicators of creative potential and of creative achievement by means of segmented regression analysis in a sample of 297 participants. Segmented regression allows for the detection of a threshold in continuous data by means of iterative computational algorithms. We found thresholds only for measures of creative potential but not for creative achievement. For the former the thresholds varied as a function of criteria: When investigating a liberal criterion of ideational originality (i.e., two original ideas), a threshold was detected at around 100 IQ points. In contrast, a threshold of 120 IQ points emerged when the criterion was more demanding (i.e., many original ideas). Moreover, an IQ of around 85 IQ points was found to form the threshold for a purely quantitative measure of creative potential (i.e., ideational fluency). These results confirm the threshold hypothesis for qualitative indicators of creative potential and may explain some of the observed discrepancies in previous research. In addition, we obtained evidence that once the intelligence threshold is met, personality factors become more predictive for creativity. On the contrary, no threshold was found for creative achievement, i.e. creative achievement benefits from higher intelligence even at fairly high levels of intellectual ability."
23825019,Homozygous deletion in TUSC3 causing syndromic intellectual disability: a new patient,Sara Loddo,"Defects in the TUSC3 gene have been identified in individuals with nonsyndromic autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ARID), due to either point mutations or intragenic deletions. We report on a boy with a homozygous microdeletion 8p22, sizing 203 kb, encompassing the first exon of the TUSC3 gene, detected by SNP-array analysis (Human Gene Chip 6.0; Affymetrix). Both nonconsanguineous parents come from a small Sicilian village and were heterozygous carriers of the microdeletion. The propositus had a few dysmorphic features and a moderate cognitive impairment. Verbal communication was impaired, with an inappropriate phonetic inventory, important phono-articolatory distortions, and bucco-phonatory dyspraxia. Comprehension was possible for simple sentences. Behavior was characterized by motor instability, high tendency to irritability and distraibility, anxiety traits, and an oppositional-defiant disorder. His parents were of normal intelligence. TUSC3 is thought to encode a subunit of the endoplasmic reticulum-bound oligosaccharyltranferase complex that catalyzes a pivotal step in the protein N-glycosylation process. TUSC3 has been recently reported as a member of the plasma membrane Mg(2+) transport system, with a possible involvement in learning abilities, working memory and short- and long-term memory. This is the third family in which a deletion has been described. Although the pathogenic mechanism has not been clarified yet, our report argues for a more prominent role of TUSC3 in the etiology of intellectual disability and that deletions encompassing this gene could be more common than expected."
23824674,Clinical and radiographic features of the autosomal recessive form of brachyolmia caused by PAPSS2 mutations,Aritoshi Iida,"Brachyolmia is a heterogeneous skeletal dysplasia characterized by generalized platyspondyly without significant long-bone abnormalities. Based on the mode of inheritance and radiographic features, at least three types of brachyolmia have been postulated. We recently identified an autosomal recessive form of brachyolmia that is caused by loss-of-function mutations of PAPSS2, the gene encoding PAPS (3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate) synthase 2. To understand brachyolmia caused by PAPSS2 mutations (PAPSS2-brachyolmia), we extended our PAPSS2 mutation analysis to 13 patients from 10 families and identified homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in all. Nine different mutations were found: three splice donor-site mutations, three missense mutations, and three insertion or deletion mutations within coding regions. In vitro enzyme assays showed that the missense mutations were also loss-of-function mutations. Phenotypic characteristics of PAPSS2-brachyolmia include short-trunk short stature, normal intelligence and facies, spinal deformity, and broad proximal interphalangeal joints. Radiographic features include platyspondyly with rectangular vertebral bodies and irregular end plates, broad ilia, metaphyseal changes of the proximal femur, including short femoral neck and striation, and dysplasia of the short tubular bones. PAPSS2-brachyolmia includes phenotypes of the conventional clinical concept of brachyolmia, the Hobaek and Toledo types, and is associated with abnormal androgen metabolism."
23823672,"A longitudinal study of relationships between previous academic achievement, emotional intelligence and personality traits with psychological health of medical students during stressful periods",Muhamad Saiful Bahri Yusoff,"Context: There is considerable evidence that emotional intelligence, previous academic achievement (i.e. cumulative grade point average (GPA)) and personality are associated with success in various occupational settings. This study evaluated the relationships of these variables with psychological health of first year medical students during stressful periods. Methods: A 1-year prospective study was done with students accepted into the School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia. Information on emotional intelligence, GPA and personality traits were obtained prior to admission. The validated Universiti Sains Malaysia Emotional Quotient Inventory and Universiti Sains Malaysia Personality Inventory were used to measure emotional intelligence and personality traits, respectively. Stress, anxiety and depression were measured by the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale during the end-of-course (time 1) and final (time 2) examinations. Results: At the less stressful period (time 1), stress level was associated with agreeableness and the final GPA, anxiety level was associated with emotional control and emotional conscientiousness and depression level was associated with the final GPA and extraversion. At the more stressful period (time 2), neuroticism associated with stress level, anxiety level was associated with neuroticism and emotional expression, and depression level was associated with neuroticism. Conclusions: This study found that neuroticism was the strongest associated factor of psychological health of medical students during their most stressful testing period. Various personality traits, emotional intelligence and previous academic performance were associated factors of psychological health during a less stressful period. These data suggest that early identification of medical students who are vulnerable to the stressful environment of medical schools might help them maintain psychological well-being during medical training."

The present studies view is bottom-up and the interviews are done directly with the hospitals CIOs. There are some effects like the G-DRG implementation in Germany that are evident in the results. The survey indicates also the different methods of adapting the solutions, either by having an all-in-one solution by a single provider or by using a modular solution from multiple providers."
23823374,Predicting asthma exacerbations using artificial intelligence,Joseph Finkelstein,"Modern telemonitoring systems identify a serious patient deterioration when it already occurred. It would be much more beneficial if the upcoming clinical deterioration were identified ahead of time even before a patient actually experiences it. The goal of this study was to assess artificial intelligence approaches which potentially can be used in telemonitoring systems for advance prediction of changes in disease severity before they actually occur. The study dataset was based on daily self-reports submitted by 26 adult asthma patients during home telemonitoring consisting of 7001 records. Two classification algorithms were employed for building predictive models: naïve Bayesian classifier and support vector machines. Using a 7-day window, a support vector machine was able to predict asthma exacerbation to occur on the day 8 with the accuracy of 0.80, sensitivity of 0.84 and specificity of 0.80. Our study showed that methods of artificial intelligence have significant potential in developing individualized decision support for chronic disease telemonitoring systems."

23818655,Explaining the increasing heritability of cognitive ability across development: a meta-analysis of longitudinal twin and adoption studies,Daniel A Briley,"Genes account for increasing proportions of variation in cognitive ability across development, but the mechanisms underlying these increases remain unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of longitudinal behavioral genetic studies spanning infancy to adolescence. We identified relevant data from 16 articles with 11 unique samples containing a total of 11,500 twin and sibling pairs who were all reared together and measured at least twice between the ages of 6 months and 18 years. Longitudinal behavioral genetic models were used to estimate the extent to which early genetic influences on cognition were amplified over time and the extent to which innovative genetic influences arose with time. Results indicated that in early childhood, innovative genetic influences predominate but that innovation quickly diminishes, and amplified influences account for increasing heritability following age 8 years."
23818653,The nature and nurture of high IQ: an extended sensitive period for intellectual development,Angela M Brant,"IQ predicts many measures of life success, as well as trajectories of brain development. Prolonged cortical thickening observed in individuals with high IQ might reflect an extended period of synaptogenesis and high environmental sensitivity or plasticity. We tested this hypothesis by examining the timing of changes in the magnitude of genetic and environmental influences on IQ as a function of IQ score. We found that individuals with high IQ show high environmental influence on IQ into adolescence (resembling younger children), whereas individuals with low IQ show high heritability of IQ in adolescence (resembling adults), a pattern consistent with an extended sensitive period for intellectual development in more-intelligent individuals. The pattern held across a cross-sectional sample of almost 11,000 twin pairs and a longitudinal sample of twins, biological siblings, and adoptive siblings."
23818356,Adjuvant chemotherapy after reduced craniospinal irradiation dose in children with average-risk medulloblastoma: a 5-year follow-up study,H A Wahba,"Purpose: This study was undertaken to determine the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy combined with reduced-dose craniospinal irradiation (CSI) on survival and neurocognitive sequelae of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with average- risk medulloblastoma above the age of 3 years. Methods: Thirty-three children between 3 and 10 years of age with average-risk medulloblastoma were treated with postoperative reduced-dose CSI (24.0 Gy) and 30.6 Gy of local RT (total of 54.6 Gy) and then with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide every 4 weeks for 8 cycles. Results: At 5 years, event-free survival (EFS) was 79%, while overall survival (OS) was 85%. Sites of relapse were local in 3%, neuraxis in 9% and both local and neuraxis in 9% of the patients. Chemotherapy was well tolerated. Hematopoietic toxicity was the most predominant side effect followed by vomiting and ototoxicity. No grade III or IV nephrotoxicity or neurotoxicity and no treatment-related deaths were encountered. Insignificant decline of intelligence quotient (IQ) was reported in 28.6% of the patients. Conclusion: The preliminary results of adjuvant chemotherapy after reduced-dose CSI in average-risk medulloblastoma patients are encouraging and effective, and can be applied safely with acceptable toxicity."
23816840,In vitro fertilization and late preterm preschoolers' neuropsychological outcomes: the PETIT study,Katherine A Berry,"Objective: In vitro fertilization (IVF) is considered a generally safe procedure, although associated with a higher incidence of preterm birth. The literature is inconsistent about the psychological impact of IVF, and we found no reports about outcome in late preterm (LPT) children. Our objective was to study neuropsychological and behavioral outcomes in a cohort of preschoolers born LPT between 2004 and 2007. Study design: Participants were 397 LPT children (mean age, 3.8 years) conceived assisted by IVF (n = 105) or non-IVF (n = 292). Standardized performance-based tests of general conceptual ability (intelligence quotient), executive function, focused/selective attention, visual-spatial perception, visual-motor skill, manual dexterity, learning, and memory were administered. Parents completed behavioral and executive function questionnaires. Results: IVF group characteristics included older maternal age (P < .001), lower birthweight (P < .001), and higher maternal education (P < .001). No main-effect significant group differences were found for any variable after controlling for these variables. However, sex differences were demonstrated for the neuropsychological variables in copying (P > .001), nonverbal reasoning (P = .001), manual dexterity (P = .001), and inhibitory capacity (P = .006), all favoring girls. Conclusion: Birth following IVF-assisted conception did not increase the risk of intellectual, neuropsychological, or behavioral deficit in LPT preschoolers. As shown in earlier gestational-age participants, girls have selective advantages. These findings should be reassuring for parents who conceive through IVF and deliver infants 1-3 weeks before term gestational age. Future study of these children at elementary school age may detect subtle impairments not yet apparent at age 3 years."
23816629,Cognitive and behavioral trajectories in 22q11DS from childhood into adolescence: a prospective 6-year follow-up study,Sasja N Duijff,"Patients with 22q11DS are at risk of behavioral problems and cognitive impairment. Recent studies suggest a possible intellectual decline in 22q11DS children. To date it is unknown if cognitive development is related to the behavioral problems in 22q11DS. We studied 53 children with 22q11DS who underwent cognitive and behavioral assessments at 9.5 years (T1) and 15.3 years (T2). In about one third, IQ data obtained at 7.5 years (T0) were also available. Results showed that internalizing behaviors intensified while externalizing behaviors decreased. Simultaneously, in about a third a significant decline in IQ was found, which, surprisingly, was unrelated to the behavioral changes. It can be concluded that children with 22q11DS follow a unique developmental trajectory. Cognitive deterioration is severe in some but does not appear to predict behavioral problems in early adolescence."
23816518,Predictors of performance improvements within a cognitive remediation program for schizophrenia,Florian Scheu,"Cognitive impairment is regarded a core feature of schizophrenia and is associated with low psychosocial functioning. There is rich evidence that cognitive remediation can improve cognitive functions in patients with schizophrenia. However, little is known about what predicts individual remediation success. Some studies suggest that baseline cognitive impairment might be a limiting factor for training response. Aim of the current study was to further examine the role of cognitive and symptom variables as predictors of remediation success. We studied a total sample of 32 patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder who were engaged in a computer-based cognitive training program (CogPack). A pre-training test battery provided cognitive measures of selective attention, executive functioning, processing speed, verbal memory, and verbal intelligence along with measures for positive and negative symptoms. Training response was defined as improvement on training tasks. Correlation analyses revealed no significant relationship between any of the baseline cognitive or symptom measures and improvement rates. However, better baseline cognition was associated with a higher percentage of tasks with initial ceiling effects. We conclude that not carefully tailoring task difficulty to patients' cognitive abilities constitutes a much more severe threat to cognitive remediation success than cognitive impairment itself."
23816240,Prefrontal cortex activity during response selection predicts processing speed impairment in schizophrenia,Neil D Woodward,"Processing speed is the most impaired neuropsychological domain in schizophrenia and a robust predictor of functional outcome. Determining the specific cognitive operations underlying processing speed dysfunction and identifying their neural correlates may assist in developing pro-cognitive interventions. Response selection, the process of mapping stimuli onto motor responses, correlates with neuropsychological tests of processing speed and may contribute to processing speed impairment in schizophrenia. This study investigated the relationship between behavioral and neural measures of response selection, and a neuropsychological index of processing speed in schizophrenia. Twenty-six patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning during performance of two- and four-choice reaction time (RT) tasks and completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS) Processing Speed Index (PSI). Response selection, defined as RT slowing between two- and four-choice RT, was impaired in schizophrenia and correlated with psychometric processing speed. Greater activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) was observed in schizophrenia and correlated with poorer WAIS PSI scores. Deficient response selection and abnormal recruitment of the dorsolateral PFC during response selection contribute to processing speed impairment in schizophrenia. Interventions that improve response selection and normalize dorsolateral PFC function may improve processing speed in schizophrenia."
23815111,Retrospective validation of WTAR and NART scores as estimators of prior cognitive ability using the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936,Dominika Dykiert,"In order to assess the degree of cognitive decline resulting from a pathological state, such as dementia, or from a normal aging process, it is necessary to know or to have a valid estimate of premorbid (or prior) cognitive ability. The National Adult Reading Test (NART; Nelson & Willison, 1991) and the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR; Psychological Corporation, 2001) are 2 tests developed to estimate premorbid or prior ability. Due to the rarity of actual prior ability data, validation studies usually compare NART/WTAR performance with measures of current abilities in pathological and nonpathological groups. In this study, we validate the use of WTAR scores and extend the validation of the use of NART scores as estimates of prior ability, vis-à-vis the actual prior (childhood) cognitive ability. We do this in a large sample of healthy older people, the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (Deary, Gow, Pattie, & Starr, 2012; Deary et al., 2007). Both NART and WTAR scores were correlated with cognitive ability tested in childhood (r = .66-.68). Scores on both the NART and the WTAR had high stability over a period of 3 years in old age (r in excess of .90) and high interrater reliability. The NART accounted for more unique variance in childhood intelligence than did the WTAR."
23813422,Is it really self-control? Examining the predictive power of the delay of gratification task,Angela L Duckworth,"This investigation tests whether the predictive power of the delay of gratification task (colloquially known as the ""marshmallow test"") derives from its assessment of self-control or of theoretically unrelated traits. Among 56 school-age children in Study 1, delay time was associated with concurrent teacher ratings of self-control and Big Five conscientiousness-but not with other personality traits, intelligence, or reward-related impulses. Likewise, among 966 preschool children in Study 2, delay time was consistently associated with concurrent parent and caregiver ratings of self-control but not with reward-related impulses. While delay time in Study 2 was also related to concurrently measured intelligence, predictive relations with academic, health, and social outcomes in adolescence were more consistently explained by ratings of effortful control. Collectively, these findings suggest that delay task performance may be influenced by extraneous traits, but its predictive power derives primarily from its assessment of self-control."
23811035,Normal intelligence and premature ovarian failure in an adult female with a 7.6 Mb de novo terminal deletion of chromosome 9p,Iris Bartels,"Distal deletion 9p is associated with gonadal dysfunction in XY individuals. Little is known about the gonadal function and fertility of XX females with this condition. We report on an affected 31-year-old infertile woman presenting with premature ovarian failure, mild dysmorphic features, a history of mild developmental delay and an otherwise normal female phenotype. Cytogenetic analysis showed a deletion 9p with the karyotype 46,XX,del(9)(p23-24) in lymphocytes. The subsequent oligonucleotide array-based CGH analysis with genomic DNA from peripheral blood revealed a terminal deletion of approximately 7.6 Mb. SNP microarray analyses of the patient and her unaffected parents confirmed the deletion breakpoint and revealed a de novo mutation of paternal origin. This is apparently the first description of an adult woman with a cytogenetically visible terminal deletion of chromosome 9p. The fertility problems observed in this patient complement earlier findings in prepubertal and pubertal 46,XX-girls with 9p deletions, who displayed a phenotype ranging from primary ovarian dysfunction and mild gonadotropin hyperresponses to positive menses. DMRT1 is hemizygous in our patient. We discuss the role of DMRT1 in female gonadal development."
23810926,Neuromuscular differences between boys with and without intellectual disability during squat jump,Anthi Hassani,"The purpose of this study was to identify the differences in vertical squat jump (SJ) between volunteers with and without intellectual disability (ID). Thirteen boys with ID (average intelligence quotient, estimated by Wisk III test: 55.6 ± 11.2) and 13 peers without disabilities performed maximal SJ on a force platform. Kinematic data were captured using a six-camera 3D motion analysis system and electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded using surface electrodes. Unpaired T-test determined the statistical difference between the two groups. The obtained results indicated that the group with ID, jumped lower, developed lower vertical ground reaction forces, knee power output, knee angular velocity, and take-off velocity, and showed longer propulsion duration, decreased mean to maximum agonist EMG activity and higher antagonist/agonist activity ratio. The deficit in the SJ observed in individuals with ID was attributed to a deficit in the examined mechanical and neuromuscular parameters, and especially to the agonist and antagonist co-contraction."
23810695,Macromolecular symmetric assembly prediction using swarm intelligence dynamic modeling,Matteo T Degiacomi,"Proteins often assemble in multimeric complexes to perform a specific biologic function. However, trapping these high-order conformations is difficult experimentally. Therefore, predicting how proteins assemble using in silico techniques can be of great help. The size of the associated conformational space and the fact that proteins are intrinsically flexible structures make this optimization problem extremely challenging. Nonetheless, known experimental spatial restraints can guide the search process, contributing to model biologically relevant states. We present here a swarm intelligence optimization protocol able to predict the arrangement of protein symmetric assemblies by exploiting a limited amount of experimental restraints and steric interactions. Importantly, within this scheme the native flexibility of each protein subunit is taken into account as extracted from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We show that this is a key ingredient for the prediction of biologically functional assemblies when, upon oligomerization, subunits explore activated states undergoing significant conformational changes."
23810511,Empathic accuracy and cognition in schizotypal personality disorder,Luis H Ripoll,"Interpersonal dysfunction contributes to significant disability in the schizophrenia spectrum. Schizotypal Personality Disorder (SPD) is a schizophrenia-related personality demonstrating social cognitive impairment in the absence of frank psychosis. Past research indicates that cognitive dysfunction or schizotypy may account for social cognitive dysfunction in this population. We tested SPD subjects and healthy controls on the Empathic Accuracy (EA) paradigm and the Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), assessing the impact of EA on social support. We also explored whether EA differences could be explained by intelligence, working memory, trait empathy, or attachment avoidance. SPD subjects did not differ from controls in RMET, but demonstrated lower EA during negative valence videos, associated with lower social support. Dynamic, multimodal EA paradigms may be more effective at capturing interpersonal dysfunction than static image tasks such as RMET. Schizotypal severity, trait empathy, and cognitive dysfunction did not account for empathic dysfunction in SPD, although attachment avoidance is related to empathic differences. Empathic dysfunction for negative affect contributes to decreased social support in the schizophrenia spectrum. Future research may shed further light on potential links between attachment avoidance, empathic dysfunction, and social support."
23810510,The effect of obsessive-compulsive symptomatology on executive functions in schizophrenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Ruth Cunill,"The presence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is frequent in patients with schizophrenia and has been associated with greater functional impairment. The impact of these features on cognitive function is unclear. In this article, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of OCS/OCD on executive functions in schizophrenia patients. Results indicate that schizophrenia patients with OCS/OCD were more impaired in abstract thinking than schizophrenia patients without OCS/OCD. This finding provides support to the double jeopardy hypothesis and may partially explain the greater functional impairment shown in schizo-obsessive patients compared to those with schizophrenia. Inconsistent results were found for set-shifting, cognitive flexibility, cognitive inhibition and verbal fluency, as indicated by the high statistical heterogeneity found. Potential sources of heterogeneity such as definition of OCS/OCD, age of onset, severity of negative symptoms and premorbid intelligence were planned to be explored but there was an insufficient number of studies to perform these analyses. Our findings highlight the complexity of the relationship between OCS/OCD and schizophrenia and warrant further investigation of the cognitive function of schizo-obsessive patients."
23810172,"What (or who) causes health inequalities: theories, evidence and implications?",Gerry McCartney,"Health inequalities are the unjust differences in health between groups of people occupying different positions in society. Since the Black Report of 1980 there has been considerable effort to understand what causes them, so as to be able to identify actions to reduce them. This paper revisits and updates the proposed theories, evaluates the evidence in light of subsequent epidemiological research, and underlines the political and policy ramifications. The Black Report suggested four theories (artefact, selection, behavioural/cultural and structural) as to the root causes of health inequalities and suggested that structural theory provided the best explanation. These theories have since been elaborated to include intelligence and meritocracy as part of selection theory. However, the epidemiological evidence relating to the proposed causal pathways does not support these newer elaborations. They may provide partial explanations or insights into the mechanisms between cause and effect, but structural theory remains the best explanation as to the fundamental causes of health inequalities. The paper draws out the vitally important political and policy implications of this assessment. Health inequalities cannot be expected to reduce substantially as a result of policy aimed at changing health behaviours, particularly in the face of wider public policy that militates against reducing underlying social inequalities. Furthermore, political rhetoric about the need for 'cultural change', without the required changes in the distribution of power, income, wealth, or in the regulatory frameworks in society, is likely to divert from necessary action."
23810120,General intellectual functioning as a buffer against theory-of-mind deficits in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis,Ji-Won Hur,"The influence of neurocognition, including general intelligence, on theory of mind (ToM) among patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder is controversial. The purpose of the present study was to identify the influences of the non-ToM cognition and general intelligence on ToM performance in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis. Fifty-five UHR subjects and 58 healthy controls (HCs) completed neurocognitive, verbal, and nonverbal ToM tasks. UHR individuals showed poorer performance in the two verbal ToM tasks, the false-belief task and the strange-story tasks. Moreover, the UHR subjects displayed poorer recall on the interference list of the verbal learning test. Linear regression analysis revealed that neurocognitive functioning, including executive functioning, working memory, and general intelligence, accounted for significant amounts of the variance in the results for UHR individuals: 20.4% in the false-belief task, 44.0% in the strange-story task, and 49.0% in the nonverbal cartoon task. Neurocognition, including general intelligence, was not a significant contributor to performance on ToM tasks in HCs. ToM deficits were not noted in UHR individuals with above-average IQ scores (≥ 110) compared with UHR subjects with IQ scores less than 110, who displayed significant differences on all ToM tasks compared with HCs. The present results suggest that ToM deficits in UHR individuals are complex and may be influenced by non-ToM cognition. Our findings are discussed in relation to the role of neurocognitive abilities in ToM-related impairments in UHR individuals."
23809646,Somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) autoreceptor function in major depression as assessed using the shift in electroencephalographic frequency spectrum with buspirone,R H McAllister-Williams,"Background: Positron emission tomography and post-mortem studies of the number of somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT(1A)) autoreceptors in raphé nuclei have found both increases and decreases in depression. However, recent genetic studies suggest they may be increased in number and/or function. The current study examined the effect of buspirone on the electroencephalographic (EEG) centroid frequency, a putative index of somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) receptor functional status, in a cohort of medication-free depressed patients and controls. Method: A total of 15 depressed patients (nine male) and intelligence quotient (IQ)-, gender- and age-matched healthy controls had resting EEG recorded from 29 scalp electrodes prior to and 30, 60 and 90 min after oral buspirone (30 mg) administration. The effect of buspirone on somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) receptors was assessed by calculating the EEG centroid frequency between 6 and 10.5 Hz. The effect of buspirone on postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors was assessed by measuring plasma growth hormone, prolactin and cortisol concentrations. Results: Analysis of variance revealed a significantly greater effect of buspirone on the EEG centroid frequency in patients compared with controls (F1,28 = 6.55, p = 0.016). There was no significant difference in the neuroendocrine responses between the two groups. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with an increase in the functional status of somatodendritic, but not postsynaptic, 5-HT1A autoreceptors, in medication-free depressed patients in line with hypotheses based on genetic data. This increase in functional status would be hypothesized to lead to an increase in serotonergic negative feedback, and hence decreased release of 5-HT at raphé projection sites, in depressed patients."
23809003,Executive function in children and adolescents with unilateral cerebral palsy,Harriet L Bodimeade,"Aim: The aim of this study was to compare executive function in children with left- and right-sided unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) and typically developing children. Method: There was a cross-sectional cohort of 46 children with unilateral CP (24 right-side, 22 left-side; 25 males, 21 females; mean age 11y 1mo, SD 2y 5mo) and 20 typically developing children (nine males, 11 females; mean age 10y 10mo, SD 2y 4mo). Four cognitive domains of executive function were assessed: attentional control, cognitive flexibility, goal setting, and information processing. Subtests from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, the Test of Everyday Attention for Children, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex figure, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition were utilized. Between-group differences (right unilateral CP, left unilateral CP, and typically developing children) were examined using analyses of covariance. Results: Children with CP performed significantly more poorly than typically developing children on all executive function measures (aggregate executive function: F(1,63)=31.16; p<0.001; η(2) =0.33). There were no significant differences between children with left and right unilateral CP, except in the case of inhibition/switching total errors, with children with left unilateral CP making fewer errors than children with right unilateral CP (F(1,39)=4.14; p=0.049; η(2) =0.1). Interpretation: Children and adolescents with unilateral CP experience difficulties across multiple executive function domains compared with typically developing children, irrespective of the side of hemiplegia. This finding supports an early vulnerability model of early brain injury and has implications for intervention for children with CP."
23808126,Diagnosis and management of autism in adults,Vyara Valkanova,"Autism affects 1.1% of the adult population. The spectrum of symptoms is wide; some individuals have above average intelligence and are fully independent, while others have limited independence because of a learning disability. Developmental delay is a core feature, and autism is usually diagnosed in childhood. High-functioning individuals with autism, Asperger's syndrome, may remain undiagnosed until adulthood. Autism is a life-long condition characterised by problems in two core dimensions: difficulties with social communication and strongly repetitive behaviour, resistance to change or restricted interests.The history should identify early developmental and behavioural problems in different settings e.g. at home, in education or employment. Sensory and GI problems are very common, and should be asked about. The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ-10) is a 10-item questionnaire for people with suspected autism. The advantage of using this in primary care is that it provides a time-efficient, structured way of ascertaining key symptoms and clearly signals those who should be referred for further assessment. Patients should be referred if autism is suspected clinically and a diagnosis of autism should be confirmed by a specialist multidisciplinary team. If a diagnosis of autism is made, clinicians should do a risk assessment and formulate risk and crisis management plans. These should include details of the roles and responsibilities of both the specialist team and primary care team in managing crisis situations. For adults with autism a group-based or an individual learning programme to improve social interaction is recommended. Adults with autism have high rates of unemployment, and employment programmes have been successfully used to support people"
23807986,"The unification of physical chemical and biological actions of spirits of glycerin and cholesterol in cell's absorption of fatty acids: the singularity of pathogenesis of ""metabolic pandemics""]",V N Titov,"According to phylogenetic theory of pathology, atherosclerosis is a syndrome of deficiency of essential polyene fatty acids in cells. The unfavorable impact of environment and derangement of biological function of trophology (function of nutrition) results in failure of transfer in the structure of lipoproteins and their active absorption by cells and metabolism of lipids and fatty acids. All these processes were formed billions years in the past at the autocrine (cell) level, in paracrine cenosis of cells and at the level of organism. The apparent derangements of trophology ""highlight"" the regular and metabolic limitations (hidden ""defects"") which derange bioavailability of essential polyene fatty acids for cells by blocking cells' active absorption. The processes of metabolism of nonpolar ethers of fatty acids with spirits of glycerin and cholesterol are impacted too. The biological function of intelligence applied the biological modes can eliminate this derangement through development of theory of pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its effective prevention. The normalization of biological function of trophology and brining to conformity with capacities of organism advanced in phylogenesis are the only effective mode of prevention. This approach will decrease at once the prevalence of all ""metabolic pandemics"" in population. The spirit cholesterol will continue to occupy a fitting position in diagnostics of atherosclerosis on a par with spirit glycerin with identification of triglycerides. Both spirits are of equal value as diagnostic tests to detect the failure of transfer in the structure of lipoproteins and active receptor absorption of fatty acids by cells. The article proposes to unify on the basis of pathogenesis all ""metabolic pandemics"", diabetes mellitus included, into the section of clinical medicine and name it ""pathology of fatty acids""."
26379311,Does Biology Justify Ideology? The Politics of Genetic Attribution,Elizabeth Suhay,"Conventional wisdom suggests that political conservatives are more likely than liberals to endorse genetic explanations for many human characteristics and behaviors. Whether and to what extent this is true has received surprisingly limited systematic attention. We examine evidence from a large U.S. public opinion survey that measured the extent to which respondents believed genetic explanations account for a variety of differences among individuals as well as groups in society. We find that conservatives were indeed more likely than liberals to endorse genetic explanations for perceived race and class differences in characteristics often associated with socioeconomic inequality (intelligence, math skills, drive, and violence). Different ideological divisions emerged, however, with respect to respondents' explanations for sexual orientation. Here, liberals were more likely than conservatives to say that sexual orientation is due to genes and less likely to say that it is due to choice or the environment. These patterns suggest that conservative and liberal ideologues will tend to endorse genetic explanations where their policy positions are bolstered by ""naturalizing"" human differences. That said, debates over genetic influence may be more politicized with respect to race, class, and sexual orientation than population differences generally: We find that left/right political ideology was not significantly associated with genetic (or other) attributions for individual differences in intelligence, math skills, drive, or violence. We conclude that conceptions of the proper role of government are closely intertwined with assumptions about the causes of human difference, but that this relationship is a complex one."
26304223,Computational models of planning,Hector Geffner,"The selection of the action to do next is one of the central problems faced by autonomous agents. Natural and artificial systems address this problem in various ways: action responses can be hardwired, they can be learned, or they can be computed from a model of the situation, the actions, and the goals. Planning is the model-based approach to action selection and a fundamental ingredient of intelligent behavior in both humans and machines. Planning, however, is computationally hard as the consideration of all possible courses of action is not computationally feasible. The problem has been addressed by research in Artificial Intelligence that in recent years has uncovered simple but powerful computational principles that make planning feasible. The principles take the form of domain-independent methods for computing heuristics or appraisals that enable the effective generation of goal-directed behavior even over huge spaces. In this paper, we look at several planning models, at methods that have been shown to scale up to large problems, and at what these methods may suggest about the human mind.

25664281,Exploratory Analysis in Time-Varying Data Sets: a Healthcare Network Application,Narine Manukyan,"We introduce a new method for exploratory analysis of large data sets with time-varying features, where the aim is to automatically discover novel relationships between features (over some time period) that are predictive of any of a number of time-varying outcomes (over some other time period). Using a genetic algorithm, we co-evolve (i) a subset of predictive features, (ii) which attribute will be predicted (iii) the time period over which to assess the predictive features, and (iv) the time period over which to assess the predicted attribute. After validating the method on 15 synthetic test problems, we used the approach for exploratory analysis of a large healthcare network data set. We discovered a strong association, with 100% sensitivity, between hospital participation in multi-institutional quality improvement collaboratives during or before 2002, and changes in the risk-adjusted rates of mortality and morbidity observed after a 1-2 year lag. The proposed approach is a potentially powerful and general tool for exploratory analysis of a wide range of time-series data sets."
25486829,Emotional intelligence and oscillatory responses on the emotional facial expressions],G G Kniazev,"Emotional intelligence-related differences in oscillatory responses to emotional facial expressions were investigated in 48 subjects (26 men and 22 women) in age 18-30 years. Participants were instructed to evaluate emotional expression (angry, happy and neutral) of each presented face on an analog scale ranging from -100 (very hostile) to + 100 (very friendly). High emotional intelligence (EI) participants were found to be more sensitive to the emotional content of the stimuli. It showed up both in their subjective evaluation of the stimuli and in a stronger EEG theta synchronization at an earlier (between 100 and 500 ms after face presentation) processing stage. Source localization using sLORETA showed that this effect was localized in the fusiform gyrus upon the presentation of angry faces and in the posterior cingulate gyrus upon the presentation of happy faces. At a later processing stage (500-870 ms) event-related theta synchronization in high emotional intelligence subject was higher in the left prefrontal cortex upon the presentation of happy faces, but it was lower in the anterior cingulate cortex upon presentation of angry faces. This suggests the existence of a mechanism that can be selectively increase the positive emotions and reduce negative emotions."
23807768,"Behavioral problems in school-aged hearing-impaired children: the influence of sociodemographic, linguistic, and medical factors",Stephanie C P M Theunissen,"The purpose of this study was to examine several behavioral problems in school-aged hearing-impaired children with hearing aids or cochlear implants, compared to normally hearing children. Additionally, we wanted to investigate which sociodemographic, linguistic, and medical factors contributed to the level of behavioral problems, to pinpoint where targeted interventions can take place. This large, retrospective study included a sample of 261 school-aged children (mean age = 11.8 years, SD = 1.6), that consisted of three age- and gender-matched subgroups: 75 with hearing aids, 57 with cochlear implants, and 129 normally hearing controls. Self- and parent-reports concerning reactive and proactive aggression, delinquency, and symptoms of psychopathy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder were used. In addition, several language and intelligence tests were administered. Hearing-impaired children showed significantly more proactive aggression, symptoms of psychopathy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder than their normally hearing peers. More behavioral problems were associated with special schools for the deaf, sign (-supported) language, hearing aids (in contrast to cochlear implants), higher age, male gender, lower socioeconomic status, lower intelligence, and delayed language development. Hearing-impaired children face multiple problems regarding their behavior. The outcomes implicate that professionals should be aware of the higher risk of developing behavioral problems, in order to screen, detect, and treat in time. Furthermore, the associated risk and protective factors emphasize that clinicians must always consider the heterogeneity of the group of hearing-impaired children, in order to help and support the individual patient."
23807237,Intact emotion-cognition interaction in schizophrenia patients and first-degree relatives: evidence from an emotional antisaccade task,Désirée S Aichert,"Schizophrenia patients have deficits in cognitive control as well as in a number of emotional domains. The antisaccade task is a measure of cognitive control that requires the inhibition of a reflex-like eye movement to a peripheral stimulus. Antisaccade performance has been shown to be modulated by the emotional content of the peripheral stimuli, with emotional stimuli leading to higher error rates than neutral stimuli, reflecting an implicit emotion processing effect. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact on antisaccade performance of threat-related emotional facial stimuli in schizophrenia patients, first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Fifteen patients, 22 relatives and 26 controls, matched for gender, age and verbal intelligence, carried out an antisaccade task with pictures of faces displaying disgusted, fearful and neutral expressions as peripheral stimuli. We observed higher antisaccade error rates in schizophrenia patients compared to first-degree relatives and controls. Relatives and controls did not differ significantly from each other. Antisaccade error rate was influenced by the emotional nature of the stimuli: participants had higher antisaccade error rates in response to fearful faces compared to neutral and disgusted faces. As this emotional influence on cognitive control did not differ between groups we conclude that implicit processing of emotional faces is intact in patients with schizophrenia and those at risk for the illness."
23806814,Using machine learning for improving knowledge on antibacterial effect of bioactive glass,M M Echezarreta-López,"The aim of this work was to find relationships between critical bioactive glass characteristics and their antibacterial behaviour using an artificial intelligence tool. A large dataset including ingredients and process variables of the bioactive glasses production, bacterial characteristics and microbiological experimental conditions was generated from literature and analyzed by neurofuzzy logic technology. Our findings allow an explanation on the variability in antibacterial behaviour found by different authors and to obtain general conclusions about critical parameters of bioactive glasses to be considered in order to achieve activity against some of the most common skin and implant surgery pathogens."

23806085,Comparison between β-thalassemia minor and normal individuals using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale,Nasser Zangiabadi,"The present study aimed at investigating and comparing patients suffering from β-thalassemia (β-thal) minor with normal individuals in regard to their performances in the short version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) test. Patients with β-thal minor are carriers of β-thal genes. They have mild microcytic and hypochromic anemia and are usually asymptomatic. In this cross-sectional study, a total of 60 individuals were divided into two equal groups of β-thal minor and normal subjects; they were then studied by the WAIS subscales. The mean performance scores of the normal group in the subtests of arithmetic and vocabulary (p <0.01) and picture completion (p <0.05) were higher than those of the thalassemia group. The mean performance score and ability of the normal group on the verbal scale was higher in comparison to the thalassemia group (p <0.05), while on the non verbal scale, there was no significant difference between the two groups. It can be concluded that β-thal minor negatively influences verbal fluency, reasoning and conceptualization, and sequencing tasks, perceptual skill, prediction of social situations and abstract thinking."
23805178,Phrasal Paraphrase Based Question Reformulation for Archived Question Retrieval,Yu Zhang,"Lexical gap in cQA search, resulted by the variability of languages, has been recognized as an important and widespread phenomenon. To address the problem, this paper presents a question reformulation scheme to enhance the question retrieval model by fully exploring the intelligence of paraphrase in phrase-level. It compensates for the existing paraphrasing research in a suitable granularity, which either falls into fine-grained lexical-level or coarse-grained sentence-level. Given a question in natural language, our scheme first detects the involved key-phrases by jointly integrating the corpus-dependent knowledge and question-aware cues. Next, it automatically extracts the paraphrases for each identified key-phrase utilizing multiple online translation engines, and then selects the most relevant reformulations from a large group of question rewrites, which is formed by full permutation and combination of the generated paraphrases. Extensive evaluations on a real world data set demonstrate that our model is able to characterize the complex questions and achieves promising performance as compared to the state-of-the-art methods."
23805030,Algorithmic requirements for swarm intelligence in differently coupled collective systems,Jürgen Stradner,"Swarm systems are based on intermediate connectivity between individuals and dynamic neighborhoods. In natural swarms self-organizing principles bring their agents to that favorable level of connectivity. They serve as interesting sources of inspiration for control algorithms in swarm robotics on the one hand, and in modular robotics on the other hand. In this paper we demonstrate and compare a set of bio-inspired algorithms that are used to control the collective behavior of swarms and modular systems: BEECLUST, AHHS (hormone controllers), FGRN (fractal genetic regulatory networks), and VE (virtual embryogenesis). We demonstrate how such bio-inspired control paradigms bring their host systems to a level of intermediate connectivity, what delivers sufficient robustness to these systems for collective decentralized control. In parallel, these algorithms allow sufficient volatility of shared information within these systems to help preventing local optima and deadlock situations, this way keeping those systems flexible and adaptive in dynamic non-deterministic environments."
23803884,Long-term effects of LCPUFA supplementation on childhood cognitive outcomes,John Colombo,"Background: The effect of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) intake on cognitive development is controversial. Most randomized trials have assessed cognition at 18 mo, although significant development of cognitive abilities (early executive function) emerge later. Objective: The objective was to evaluate cognition beyond 18 mo and longitudinal cognitive change from 18 mo to 6 y in children who were fed variable amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (0.32%, 0.64%, and 0.96% of total fatty acids) and arachidonic acid (ARA; 0.64%) compared with children who were not fed LCPUFA as infants. Design: Eighty-one children (19 placebo, 62 LCPUFA) who participated in a double-blind, randomized trial of LCPUFA supplementation as infants were re-enrolled at 18 mo and tested every 6 mo until 6 y on age-appropriate standardized and specific cognitive tests. Results: LCPUFA supplementation did not influence performance on standardized tests of language and performance at 18 mo; however, significant positive effects were observed from 3 to 5 y on rule-learning and inhibition tasks, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test at 5 y, and the Weschler Primary Preschool Scales of Intelligence at 6 y. Effects of LCPUFAs were not found on tasks of spatial memory, simple inhibition, or advanced problem solving. Conclusions: The data from this relatively small trial suggest that, although the effects of LCPUFAs may not always be evident on standardized developmental tasks at 18 mo, significant effects may emerge later on more specific or fine-grained tasks. The results imply that studies of nutrition and cognitive development should be powered to continue through early childhood. This parent trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00266825."
23803689,Electrophysiological indices of response inhibition in human polydrug users,C A Roberts,"Previous research in ecstasy users suggests impairment of various executive functions. In general, the executive function of response inhibition appears unaffected by ecstasy use. Nonetheless, it remains a possibility that cognitive tasks alone are not sensitive enough to pick up subtle changes in function. The current study sought to investigate behavioural measures of response inhibition and their electrophysiological correlates in drug users. Twenty ecstasy polydrug users, 20 non-ecstasy polydrug users and 20 drug naïve controls were recruited. Participants completed questionnaires about their background drug use, sleep quality, fluid intelligence and mood state. Each individual also completed a Go/NoGo response inhibition task whilst electroencephalography (EEG) measures were recorded. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that there were no between-group differences on the behavioural measure of response inhibition. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed no main effect of group across midline electrodes for the P3, N2 and P2 components. Univariate ANOVA revealed significant between-group differences in the P2 component with the ecstasy user group having a significantly higher mean amplitude than drug naïve controls at two midline frontal electrodes: at Fz and significantly higher mean amplitude than both control groups at FCz. The present study provides evidence of atypical early processing in ecstasy users that is suggestive of compensatory mechanisms ameliorating any behavioural differences."
23802509,Association of eveningness with problem behavior in children: a mediating role of impaired sleep,Kristiaan B van der Heijden,"Eveningness, the preference of being active during the evening in contrast to the morning, has been associated with markedly increased problem behavior in adolescents; however, the underlying mechanisms are still not understood. This study investigates the association of eveningness with behavior and cognition in children aged 7-12 yrs, and explores the potential mediating role of a variety of sleep factors. Parents of 333 school-aged children (mean age=9.97 yrs; 55% girls) completed a sleep log and several questionnaires regarding eveningness, sleep habits, and behavioral problems. Intellectual abilities, working memory, and attention were assessed using the short-form of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and subtasks of the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks. Results showed that eveningness predicted behavioral problems over and above the effects of demographic variables (age, sex, and familial socioeconomic status) (p=0.003). Significant partial correlation was found for eveningness and sleep duration during weekdays (p=0.005), and not during weekends. Furthermore, evening orientation was associated with a reduced rested feeling on weekday mornings (p<0.001), but not on weekends. The most important sleep characteristic showing association with many cognitive and behavioral measures was the subjective feeling upon awakening-particularly during weekdays. Bootstrap mediation analyses demonstrated that sleep significantly mediated the effects of eveningness on behavioral problems, working memory, and sustained attention. Interestingly, mediation was only significant through the subjective feeling upon awakening on weekdays. The current findings indicate that the subjective feeling upon awakening is a much better predictor of daytime problems than subjective sleep quantity. Furthermore, the data suggest that negative outcomes in evening types are due to the fact that they wake up before their circadian drive for arousal and prior to complete dissipation of sleep pressure during weekdays. Interventions that target the misalignment of endogenous circadian rhythms and imposed rhythms are discussed."
23802123,Emotional intelligence correlates with functional responses to dynamic changes in facial trustworthiness,William D S Killgore,"Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to a constellation of traits, competencies, or abilities that allow individuals to understand emotional information and successfully navigate and solve social/emotional problems. While little is known about the neurobiological substrates that underlie EI, some evidence suggests that these capacities may involve a core neurocircuitry involved in emotional decision-making that includes the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, and amygdala. In a sample of 39 healthy volunteers (22 men; 17 women), scores on the Bar-On EQ-i (a trait/mixed model of EI) and Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT; an ability model of EI) were correlated with functional magnetic resonance imaging responses during brief presentations of moving facial expressions that changed in the level of perceived trustworthiness. Core emotion neurocircuitry was responsive to dynamic changes in facial features, regardless of whether they reflected increases or decreases in apparent trustworthiness. In response to facial movements indicating decreasing trustworthiness, MSCEIT correlated positively with functional responses of the vmPFC and rostral ACC, whereas the EQ-i was unrelated to regional activation. Systematic differences in EI ability appear to be significantly related to the responsiveness of the vmPFC and rostral ACC to facial movements suggesting potential trustworthiness."
23801955,The largest human cognitive performance dataset reveals insights into the effects of lifestyle factors and aging,Daniel A Sternberg,"Making new breakthroughs in understanding the processes underlying human cognition may depend on the availability of very large datasets that have not historically existed in psychology and neuroscience. Lumosity is a web-based cognitive training platform that has grown to include over 600 million cognitive training task results from over 35 million individuals, comprising the largest existing dataset of human cognitive performance. As part of the Human Cognition Project, Lumosity's collaborative research program to understand the human mind, Lumos Labs researchers and external research collaborators have begun to explore this dataset in order uncover novel insights about the correlates of cognitive performance. This paper presents two preliminary demonstrations of some of the kinds of questions that can be examined with the dataset. The first example focuses on replicating known findings relating lifestyle factors to baseline cognitive performance in a demographically diverse, healthy population at a much larger scale than has previously been available. The second example examines a question that would likely be very difficult to study in laboratory-based and existing online experimental research approaches at a large scale: specifically, how learning ability for different types of cognitive tasks changes with age. We hope that these examples will provoke the imagination of researchers who are interested in collaborating to answer fundamental questions about human cognitive performance."
23801937,Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II and the G374sp Mutation,E Martínez-Quintana,"Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II), also known as Hunter syndrome, is a rare, X-linked disease caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase, which catalyses a step in the catabolism of glycosaminoglycans resulting in accumulation of heparan and dermatan sulfate in many organs and tissues. This accumulation favors the appearance of neurologic involvement, severe airway obstruction, skeletal deformities, and cardiomyopathy, especially mitral and aortic valve regurgitation. In severe cases, obstructive airway disease and cardiac failure due to valvular dysfunction are the most common causes of death within the second decade of life. However, in mild cases, intelligence remains normal, stature is almost normal and death usually occurs due to cardiac failure in the fourth decade of life. We report the presentation, diagnosis, management, and outcome of 2 siblings with MPS II and the G374sp mutation at the nucleotide c.1246 of the gene encoding for the iduronate-2-sulfatase."
23800432,Estimated costs of malingered disability,Michael Chafetz,"The feigning of disabling illness for the purpose of disability compensation, or ""malingering,"" is common in Social Security Disability examinations, occurring in 45.8%-59.7% of adult cases. In this study, we estimated the costs of malingering based on mental disorder data published by the Social Security Administration. At the most widely accepted base rate of malingering in medicolegal cases involving external incentive, costs were high, totaling $20.02 billion in 2011 for adult mental disorder claimants. Moreover, these figures clearly underestimate the costs of the larger problem with feigned disability in both adults and children. We urge a change in Social Security policies to allow the use of validity testing in the examination for disability claims."
23800273,Episodic memory retrieval for story characters in high-functioning autism,Hidetsugu Komeda,"Background: The objective of this study was to examine differences in episodic memory retrieval between individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing (TD) individuals. Previous studies have shown that personality similarities between readers and characters facilitated reading comprehension. Highly extraverted participants read stories featuring extraverted protagonists more easily and judged the outcomes of such stories more rapidly than did less extraverted participants. Similarly, highly neurotic participants judged the outcomes of stories with neurotic protagonists more rapidly than did participants with low levels of neuroticism. However, the impact of the similarity effect on memory retrieval remains unclear. This study tested our 'similarity hypothesis', namely that memory retrieval is enhanced when readers with ASD and TD readers read stories featuring protagonists with ASD and with characteristics associated with TD individuals, respectively. Methods: Eighteen Japanese individuals (one female) with high-functioning ASD (aged 17 to 40 years) and 17 age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched Japanese (one female) TD participants (aged 22 to 40 years) read 24 stories; 12 stories featured protagonists with ASD characteristics, and the other 12 featured TD protagonists. Participants read a single sentence at a time and pressed a spacebar to advance to the next sentence. After reading all 24 stories, they were asked to complete a recognition task about the target sentence in each story. Results: To investigate episodic memory in ASD, we analyzed encoding based on the reading times for and readability of the stories and retrieval processes based on the accuracy of and response times for sentence recognition. Although the results showed no differences between ASD and TD groups in encoding processes, they did reveal inter-group differences in memory retrieval. Although individuals with ASD demonstrated the same level of accuracy as did TD individuals, their patterns of memory retrieval differed with respect to response times. Conclusions: Individuals with ASD more effectively retrieved ASD-congruent than ASD-incongruent sentences, and TD individuals retrieved stories with TD more effectively than stories with ASD protagonists. Thus, similarity between reader and story character had different effects on memory retrieval in the ASD and TD groups."
23798624,Pune low birth weight study - birth to adulthood - cognitive development,Sudha Chaudhari,"Objective: To assess the cognitive development of non-handicapped low birth weight (LBW) infants at 18 years. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Infants born between 1987 - 1989 with birth weight less than 2000 g and discharged from a neonatal special care unit were followed up till the age of 18 years. Methods: The intelligence quotient (IQ) was determined by Ravens progressive matrices. Assessment of adjustment and aptitude was done. Results: The cohort of 161 LBW infants was divided into three groups according to their gestation - preterm SGA (n=61), full term SGA (n=30) and preterm AGA (n=70). 71 full term AGA infants served as controls. The IQ of the study group (Percentile 39.3) was significantly lower than that of controls (Percentile 54.9) (P=0.002). Preterm SGA subjects had the lowest IQ (Percentile 35.5), though just within normal limits. Males from the study group had significantly lower IQ than male controls (P=0.03). The IQ of PTSGA subjects of college educated mothers (P=0.004) and belonging to higher socio-economic class (P=0.04) was significantly higher. On the differential aptitude test, PTSGA subjects were poor in speed and mechanical reasoning. The 18 year IQ could be best predicted by IQ at 6 and 12 years. Conclusion: Preterm SGA children have the lowest IQ at 18 years, males have lower IQ. Maternal education and socio-economic status have great impact on cognitive development. Good prediction of the 18 year IQ can be done by the 6 and 12 year IQ."
23798232,Intelligence and neurocognitive tests among students living in a industrialized region of Sardinia with relatively low blood levels of lead],Plinio Carta,"In several recent epidemiological studies blood lead levels (BLLs) even below the current CDC intervention level of 10 microg/dl have been associated with reduced neurocognitive capacities of children, with no clear evidence of a ""safe"" threshold. We analyzed the relationship between the BLLs and the neurocognitive capacities of 205 Sardinian students aged 11 to 15 years, using 2 tests of the Swedish Performance Evaluating System (SPES) and the full-scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) derived from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). The studied population included 104 children (61 males and 43 females) living in Portoscuso, a town 2 Km far from a lead smelter (mean BLLs: 5.98 +/- 2.2; max 11.5 microg/dl), and 101 age-matched students (55 males and 46 females) living in Sant'Antioco, a town about 20 Km far from the same smelter (mean BLLs: 2.08 +/- 0.8; max 4.5 microg/dl). Subjects with BLLs above 4 microg/dl performed worse in the SPES tests and scored about 5.0 points less on the full-scale IQ compared to the students with lower BLLs. The adjusted regression coefficients derived from the multivariate analysis showed that higher BLLs were significantly associated with worse performances in the SPES tests and with reduced IQ (0.94 points for each microg/dl of BLL). This study confirms the potential neurotoxicity of low-levels of lead suggesting the need of lowering the actual CDC ""limit of concern"" for children to values lower than 4 microg/dl, improving at the same time the environmental primary prevention for limiting the lead exposure of subjects living near the lead smelter."
23798014,Neuropsychological outcomes in fatty acid oxidation disorders: 85 cases detected by newborn screening,Susan E Waisbren,"Mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorders include conditions in which the transport of activated acyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) into the mitochondria or utilization of these substrates is disrupted or blocked. This results in a deficit in the conversion of fat into energy. Most patients with fatty acid oxidation defects are now identified through newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry. With earlier identification and preventative treatments, mortality and morbidity rates have improved. However, in the absence of severe health and neurological effects from these disorders, subtle developmental delays or neuropsychological deficits have been noted. Medical records were reviewed to identify outcomes in 85 children with FAOD's diagnosed through newborn screening and followed at one metabolic center. Overall, 54% of these children identified through newborn screening experienced developmental challenges. Speech delay or relative weakness in language was noted in 26 children (31%) and motor delays were noted in 24 children (29%). The majority of the 46 children receiving psychological evaluations performed well within the average range, with only 11% scoring <85 on developmental or intelligence tests. These results highlight the importance of screening children with fatty acid oxidation disorders to identify those with language, motor, or cognitive delay. Although expanded newborn screening dramatically changes the health and developmental outcomes in many children with fatty acid oxidation disorders, it also complicates the interpretation of biochemical and molecular findings and raises questions about the effectiveness or necessity of treatment in a large number of cases. Only by systematically evaluating developmental and neuropsychological outcomes using standardized methods will the true implications of newborn screening, laboratory results, and treatments for neurocognitive outcome in these disorders become clear."
23796861,Epileptic spasms in tuberous sclerosis complex,David T Hsieh,"Purpose: To characterize epileptic spasms (ES) occurring after the age of two years in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), particularly treatment response to vigabatrin (VGB), which is extremely effective for infantile spasms (IS) in TSC. Methods: The authors retrospectively reviewed 19 patients with TSC and ES. Medical records were assessed for clinical and treatment data, neurocognitive, EEG, MRI data, and genetic analyses. Results: Of 391 patients with TSC, 19 (4.8%) had ES. Of those with detailed clinical data, six had infantile spasms that persisted after 2 years old, six recurred after an initial remission of infantile spasms (range 2-24 years old), and four occurred de novo over the age of two (range 2-20 years old). All concurrently had other seizure types. One had hypsarrhythmia on EEG. All had brain MRI stigmata typical of TSC. Thirteen had a mutation in TSC2, and one in TSC1. Six patients became spasm-free with medication treatment, including four with VGB, one with VGB in combination with the low glycemic index dietary treatment, and one with felbamate. Five became spasm-free after epilepsy surgery. VGB was not effective for seven patients. The majority continued to have refractory epilepsy. Conclusions: ES are not uncommon in patients with TSC, especially those with TSC2 mutations. ES in TSC occur in the setting of other seizure types and refractory epilepsy. Hypsarrhythmia is rare. VGB can be effective, but the success of VGB for ES in TSC is not equivalent to that of IS in TSC."
23795956,The Undergraduate Medical and Health Sciences Admissions Test: what is it measuring?,Barbara Griffin,"Background: The Undergraduate Medical and Health Sciences Admissions Test (UMAT) is used to select medical students in Australia and New Zealand but empirical evidence of its construct validity has never been reported. Aims: To identify the underlying constructs assessed in each of the three sections of the UMAT. Based on conclusions from an early qualitative study (Mercer & Chiavaroli 2006), it was expected that Section 1 scores would correlate with scores obtained from standard measures of cognitive ability (verbal and numeric reasoning), Section 2 scores would correlate with emotional intelligence, and Section 3 scores would be most strongly related to abstract or non-verbal reasoning ability. Method: Final year high school students (n = 432) completed tests of numerical, verbal, and non-verbal cognitive ability, and emotional intelligence. Correlations and multiple regressions assessed the relationship of these tests with scores on each section of the UMAT. Results: UMAT Section 1 was significantly related to verbal, non-verbal, and numerical reasoning tests. Section 2 was significantly related to emotional intelligence and verbal reasoning, but the majority of variance in this section's scores remained unexplained. Section 3 scores significantly correlated with non-verbal and numerical reasoning. Conclusions: The UMAT Sections 1 and 3 appear to be tests of cognitive abilities. Further research is required to identify the constructs being measured by Section 2."
23795918,"Openness to experience, intellect, and cognitive ability",Colin G DeYoung,"An instrument designed to separate 2 midlevel traits within each of the Big Five (the Big Five Aspect Scales [BFAS]) was used to clarify the relation of personality to cognitive ability. The BFAS measures Openness to Experience and Intellect as separate (although related) traits, and refers to the broader Big Five trait as Openness/Intellect. In 2 samples (N = 125 and 189), Intellect was independently associated with general intelligence (g) and with verbal and nonverbal intelligence about equally. Openness was independently associated only with verbal intelligence. Implications of these findings are discussed for the empirical and conceptual relations of intelligence to personality and for the mechanisms potentially underlying both Openness/Intellect and cognitive ability."
23795254,Comparing response inhibition and flexibility for two components of executive functioning in children with autism spectrum disorder and normal children,Fatemeh Pooragha,"Objective: The aim of this study was investigating and comparing two components of executive functioning in children with high function autism with normal children. Methods: This study was correlation descriptive (causal-comparative). There were two groups, one consisted of 15 participants of children with high function autism disorder (Intelligence quotient [IQ]>80) and the other consisted of 15 normal children, all age and education matched. They were compared with two neuro-cognitive tests, Color Word Stroop and Wisconsin Card Sorting, and one IQ test called Ravens Progressive Matrices test. Findings: Analysis of data showed significant difference in both executive functionings, response inhibition (Stroop) and flexibility (Wisconsin Card Sorting) between normal children and children with autism disorder, but there was no significant relation between age and IQ and executive functioning in children with autism. Conclusion: The results showed that children with autism disorder have deficits in executive functions regardless of their IQ level and it can be attributed to the symptoms of autism spectrum disorders."
23793669,Evidence-based commissioning in the English NHS: who uses which sources of evidence? A survey 2010/2011,Aileen Clarke,"Objectives: To investigate types of evidence used by healthcare commissioners when making decisions and whether decisions were influenced by commissioners' experience, personal characteristics or role at work. Design: Cross-sectional survey of 345 National Health Service (NHS) staff members. Setting: The study was conducted across 11 English Primary Care Trusts between 2010 and 2011. Participants: A total of 440 staff involved in commissioning decisions and employed at NHS band 7 or above were invited to participate in the study. Of those, 345 (78%) completed all or a part of the survey. Main outcome measures: Participants were asked to rate how important different sources of evidence (empirical or practical) were in a recent decision that had been made. Backwards stepwise logistic regression analyses were undertaken to assess the contributions of age, gender and professional background, as well as the years of experience in NHS commissioning, pay grade and work role. Results: The extent to which empirical evidence was used for commissioning decisions in the NHS varied according to the professional background. Only 50% of respondents stated that clinical guidelines and cost-effectiveness evidence were important for healthcare decisions. Respondents were more likely to report use of empirical evidence if they worked in Public Health in comparison to other departments (p<0.0005, commissioning and contracts OR 0.32, 95%CI 0.18 to 0.57, finance OR 0.19, 95%CI 0.05 to 0.78, other departments OR 0.35, 95%CI 0.17 to 0.71) or if they were female (OR 1.8 95% CI 1.01 to 3.1) rather than male. Respondents were more likely to report use of practical evidence if they were more senior within the organisation (pay grade 8b or higher OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.4 to 5.3, p=0.004 in comparison to lower pay grades). Conclusions: Those trained in Public Health appeared more likely to use external empirical evidence while those at higher pay scales were more likely to use practical evidence when making commissioning decisions. Clearly, National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance and government publications (eg, National Service Frameworks) are important for decision-making, but practical sources of evidence such as local intelligence, benchmarking data and expert advice are also influential. New Clinical Commissioning Groups will need a variety of different evidence sources and expert involvement to ensure that effective decisions are made for their populations."
23789866,A preliminary investigation of moral reasoning and empathy after traumatic brain injury in adolescents,M H Beauchamp,"Primary objective: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustained during childhood can affect a number of socio-cognitive skills; however, little attention has focused on the integrity of moral reasoning in the assessment of post-TBI social sequelae and the role of empathy and intelligence on moral maturity. Research design: In a quasi-experimental, cross-sectional research design, moral reasoning maturity and empathy in adolescents with mild-to-severe TBI (n = 25) were compared to typically-developing peers (n = 66). Methods and procedures: Participants were administered the So-Moral and So-Mature, tasks of socio-moral reasoning and maturity, the Index of Empathy for Children and Adolescents, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and a demographic questionnaire. Main outcomes and results: Participants with TBI had significantly lower levels of moral reasoning maturity. Further, adolescents with moderate-to-severe TBI had lower levels of empathy. Empathy correlated positively with moral reasoning abilities and, together with intellectual function, predicted a small, but significant proportion of moral reasoning outcome. Conclusions: Youth who sustained TBI during childhood have poorer moral reasoning abilities than their non-injured peers, potentially placing them at risk for poor social decision-making and socially maladaptive behaviour. This can have a significant impact on long-term social functioning."

In addition, characteristics of population-based methods used in primer design are discussed in detail."
23793255,Can music lessons increase the performance of preschool children in IQ tests?,Hossein Kaviani,"The impact of music on human cognition has a distinguished history as a research topic in psychology. The focus of the present study was on investigating the effects of music instruction on the cognitive development of preschool children. From a sample of 154 preschool children of Tehran kindergartens, 60 children aged between 5 and 6 were randomly assigned to two groups, one receiving music lessons and the other (matched for sex, age and mother's educational level) not taking part in any music classes. Children were tested before the start of the course of music lessons and at its end with 4 subtests of the Tehran-Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (TSB). The experimental group participated in twelve 75-min weekly music lessons. Statistical analysis showed significant IQ increase in participants receiving music lessons, specifically on the TSB verbal reasoning and short-term memory subtests. The numerical and visual/abstract reasoning abilities did not differ for the two groups after lessons. These data support studies that found similar skills enhancements in preschool children, despite vast differences in the setting in which the instruction occurred. These findings appear to be consistent with some neuroimaging and neurological observations which are discussed in the paper."
23792978,Resting state functional connectivity associated with trait emotional intelligence,Hikaru Takeuchi,"Previous neuroimaging studies have suggested that trait emotional intelligence (TEI) is associated with components of the neural network involved in social cognition (SCN) and somatic marker circuitry (SMC). Our study is the first to investigate the association of TEI with resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the key nodes of SCN and SMC [medial prefromtal cortex (mPFC) and bilateral anterior insula (AI), respectively] and other brain regions. We found that (a) the intrapersonal factor of TEI was negatively correlated with RSFC between mPFC and the anterior part of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), (b) the TEI interpersonal factor score was positively correlated with RSFC between mPFC and the lingual gyrus, and (c) total TEI was positively correlated with RSFC between mPFC and the precuneus as well as (d) between the left AI and the middle part of the right DLPFC. Taken together with previous study findings, our findings can be comprehensively understood as neural mechanisms of SCN and SMC components are associated with TEI. In particular, the fluent interaction between SCN's two key nodes (mPFC and precuneus/PCC) [as well as between DMN's two key nodes] is suggested to be crucial for total TEI. Our study also indicated that (a) a clear functional separation between the two key nodes of the two major intrinsic networks, DMN and the task-positive network (mPFC and DLPFC), is important for higher intrapersonal TEI, (b) brain interactions involving vision-related areas (lingual gyrus) and the key node of SCN (mPFC) are important for interpersonal TEI, and (c) control of DLPFC over the key node of SMC (AI) is important for total TEI."
23792265,Neural activity in the posterior superior temporal region during eye contact perception correlates with autistic traits,Naoya Hasegawa,"The present study investigated the relationship between neural activity associated with gaze processing and autistic traits in typically developed subjects using magnetoencephalography. Autistic traits in 24 typically developed college students with normal intelligence were assessed using the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). The Minimum Current Estimates method was applied to estimate the cortical sources of magnetic responses to gaze stimuli. These stimuli consisted of apparent motion of the eyes, displaying direct or averted gaze motion. Results revealed gaze-related brain activations in the 150-250 ms time window in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and in the 150-450 ms time window in medial prefrontal regions. In addition, the mean amplitude in the 150-250 ms time window in the right pSTS region was modulated by gaze direction, and its activity in response to direct gaze stimuli correlated with AQ score. pSTS activation in response to direct gaze is thought to be related to higher-order social processes. Thus, these results suggest that brain activity linking eye contact and social signals is associated with autistic traits in a typical population."
23792104,Adverse drug reactions induced by valproic acid,Radu M Nanau,"Valproic acid is a widely-used first-generation antiepileptic drug, prescribed predominantly in epilepsy and psychiatric disorders. VPA has good efficacy and pharmacoeconomic profiles, as well as a relatively favorable safety profile. However, adverse drug reactions have been reported in relation with valproic acid use, either as monotherapy or polytherapy with other antiepileptic drugs or antipsychotic drugs. This systematic review discusses valproic acid adverse drug reactions, in terms of hepatotoxicity, mitochondrial toxicity, hyperammonemic encephalopathy, hypersensitivity syndrome reactions, neurological toxicity, metabolic and endocrine adverse events, and teratogenicity."
23792091,Machine wanting,Daniel W McShea,"Wants, preferences, and cares are physical things or events, not ideas or propositions, and therefore no chain of pure logic can conclude with a want, preference, or care. It follows that no pure-logic machine will ever want, prefer, or care. And its behavior will never be driven in the way that deliberate human behavior is driven, in other words, it will not be motivated or goal directed. Therefore, if we want to simulate human-style interactions with the world, we will need to first understand the physical structure of goal-directed systems. I argue that all such systems share a common nested structure, consisting of a smaller entity that moves within and is driven by a larger field that contains it. In such systems, the smaller contained entity is directed by the field, but also moves to some degree independently of it, allowing the entity to deviate and return, to show the plasticity and persistence that is characteristic of goal direction. If all this is right, then human want-driven behavior probably involves a behavior-generating mechanism that is contained within a neural field of some kind. In principle, for goal directedness generally, the containment can be virtual, raising the possibility that want-driven behavior could be simulated in standard computational systems. But there are also reasons to believe that goal-direction works better when containment is also physical, suggesting that a new kind of hardware may be necessary."
23792063,Mosaicism for FMR1 gene full mutation and intermediate allele in a female foetus: a postzygotic retraction event,Susana Isabel Ferreira,"Fragile X syndrome is caused by the expansion of an unstable CGG repeat in the 5'UTR of FMR1 gene. The occurrence of mosaicism is not uncommon, especially in male patients, whereas in females it is not so often reported. Here we report a female foetus that was subject to prenatal diagnosis, because of her mother being a premutation carrier. The foetus was identified as being a mosaic for an intermediate allele and a full mutation of FMR1 gene, in the presence of a normal allele. The mosaic status was confirmed in three different tissues of the foetus--amniotic fluid, skin biopsy and blood--the last two obtained after pregnancy termination. Karyotype analysis and X-chromosome STR markers analysis do not support the mosaicism as inheritance of both maternal alleles. Oligonucleotide array-CGH excluded an imbalance that could contain the primer binding site with a different repeat size. The obtained results give compelling evidence for a postzygotic expansion mechanism where the foetus mosaic pattern originated from expansion of the mother's premutation into a full mutation and consequent regression to an intermediate allele in a proportion of cells. These events occurred in early embryogenesis before the commitment of cells into the different tissues, as the three tested tissues of the foetus have the same mosaic pattern. The couple has a son with Fragile X mental retardation syndrome and choose to terminate this pregnancy after genetic counselling."
23791921,Behavioral and neural correlates of emotional intelligence: an event-related potentials (ERP) study,Sivan Raz,"The present study was aimed at identifying potential behavioral and neural correlates of emotional intelligence (EI) by using scalp-recorded Event-Related Potentials (ERPs). EI levels were defined according to both self-report questionnaire and a performance-based test. We identified ERP correlates of emotional processing by comparing ERPs elicited in trials using pleasant, neutral and unpleasant pictures. The effects of these emotion-inducing pictures were then compared across groups with low and high EI levels. Behavioral results revealed a significant valence×EI group interaction effect since valence ratings were lower for unpleasant pictures and higher for pleasant pictures in the high EI group compared with the low EI group. The groups did not differ with respect to neutral picture ratings. The ERP results indicate that participants with high EI exhibited significantly greater mean amplitudes of the P2 (200-300ms post-stimulus) and P3 (310-450ms post-stimulus) ERP components in response to emotional and neutral pictures, at posterior-parietal as well as at frontal scalp locations. This may suggest greater recruitment of resources to process all emotional and non-emotional stimuli at early and late processing stages among individuals with higher EI. The present study also underscores the usefulness of ERP methodology as a sensitive measure for the study of emotional stimuli processing in the research field of EI."
23791837,General fluid-type intelligence is related to indices of white matter structure in middle-aged and old adults,Judit Haász,"General fluid-type intelligence (gF) reflects abstract reasoning and problem solving abilities, and is an important predictor for lifetime trajectories of cognition, and physical and mental health. Structural and functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the role of parieto-frontal gray matter, but the white matter (WM) underpinnings of gF and the contribution of individual gF components to gF-WM relationship still need to be explored. The aim of this study was to characterize, in a sample of 100 healthy middle-aged and old subjects (mean=63.8 years), the relationship between gF and indices of WM structure obtained from diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) (fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD)). gF was estimated by principal component analysis including measures of episodic memory, reasoning, and processing speed. Tract-based spatial statistics and permutation-based inference statistics were used to test the association between gF and WM indices, while controlling for the effect of age and sex. We hypothesized a positive relationship between gF and WM structure. Based on previous studies, we further hypothesized that this relationship was heavily influenced by the processing speed component of gF. We found a robust relationship between gF and DT-MRI measures of FA, RD and MD in all major WM tracts. Higher gF score was related to higher degree of WM integrity, in middle-aged as well as old individuals. Thus, the distributed relationship between gF and indices of WM microstructure is consistent with the notion that gF reflects efficient signaling between cortical areas. Furthermore, analysis of relationships between WM measures and gF components revealed an association with information processing speed and reasoning ability, but not with episodic memory. Thus, although all subcomponents loaded high on gF factor, the speed-related components were most strongly associated with DT-MRI-derived measures. These results suggest that DT-MRI can be used to parse gF."
23791025,Impact of breastfeeding on the intelligence quotient of eight-year-old children,Ana L M Fonseca,"Objective: This study aimed to determine the influence of breastfeeding on the intellectual capacity of children from a cohort in a developing country, with a control for the main confounding factors. Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed including all infants born in the hospitals of a medium-size city, and a random sample of these newborns was monitored at 30, 90, and 180 days of life, and at age 8 years. Several aspects of breastfeeding were assessed in the follow-up and, at 8 years, general intellectual capacity was assessed through the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices test. The statistical analyses used Student's t-test, ANOVA, and linear regression and logistics, considering p-values less than 0.05 as statistically significant associations. Results: At age 8 years, 560 children were assessed with Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices test. The average score was 22.56 points, with a standard deviation of 5.93. The difference in the averages found between the breastfed and non-breastfed groups at six months of age was 1.33 (p=0.008). Mother's and child's skin color, social and economic class, maternal education and smoking, and breastfeeding at six months of age (p=0.007) were still associated with the outcome. Conclusions: Children that were breastfed for six months or more had better performance in the general intellectual assessment, even after adjusting for the main confounding factors."
23790803,"Relationship between blood manganese levels and children's attention, cognition, behavior, and academic performance--a nationwide cross-sectional study",Soo-Young Bhang,"Manganese (Mn) is neurotoxic at high concentrations. However, Mn is an essential element that can protect against oxidative damage; thus, extremely low levels of Mn might be harmful. Our aim was to examine whether either high or low environmental Mn exposure is related to academic and attention function development among school-aged children. This cross-sectional study included 1089 children 8-11 years of age living in five representative areas in South Korea. Blood Mn, blood lead, and urine cotinine were measured. We assessed IQ with the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence; attention with a computerized continuous performance test called the Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Diagnostic System (ADS), the Korean version of the Stroop Color-Word Test, the Children's Color Trails Test (CCTT), and the ADHD Rating Scale; academic functions with the Learning Disability Evaluation Scale (LDES); and emotional and behavioral problems with the Korean version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). We further assessed the presence of ADHD using a highly structured diagnostic interview, the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (DISC-IV). The median blood concentration of Mn was 14.14 µg/L. We observed a nonlinear association between the CCTT2 completion time and the CPT commission error (F=3.14, p=0.03 and F=4.05, p=0.01, respectively). We divided the data into three groups: lower (<8.154 µg/L), and upper 5th percentile (>21.453 µg/L) and middle 90th percentile to determine whether a lack or overload of Mn could cause adverse effects. After adjusting for urine cotinine, blood lead, children's IQ, and other potential confounders, the high Mn group showed lower scores in thinking (B=-0.83, p=0.006), reading (B=-0.93, p=0.004), calculations (B=-0.72, p=0.005), and LQ (B=-4.06, p=0.006) in the LDES and a higher commission error in the CPT (B=8.02, p=0.048). The low Mn group showed lower color scores in the Stroop test (B=-3.24, p=0.040). We found that excess Mn in children is associated with lower scores of thinking, reading, calculation, and LQ in the LDES and higher scores of commission error in the ADS test. In contrast, lower Mn in children is associated with lower color scores in the Stroop test. The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that excess exposure or deficiency of Mn can cause harmful effects in children."

The scope of source coverage ranges from local media in the vernacular to international media in widely read languages. Internet biosurveillance is a timely modality that is available to government and public health officials, healthcare workers, and the public and private sector, serving as a real-time complementary approach to traditional indicator-based public health disease surveillance methods. Internet biosurveillance also supports the broader activity of epidemic intelligence. This overview covers the current state of the field of Internet biosurveillance, and provides a perspective on the future of the field."
23788522,Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms in adults with autism spectrum disorders,Kate Johnston,"Features of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and impairments on neuropsychological, tests of attention have been documented in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). To date, there has been a lack of research comparing attention in adults with ASD and adults with ADHD. In study 1, 31 adults with ASD and average intellectual function completed self-report measures of ADHD symptoms. These were compared with self-report measures of ADHD symptoms in 38 adults with ADHD and 29 general population controls. In study 2, 28 adults with a diagnosis of ASD were compared with an age- and intelligence quotient-matched sample of 28 adults with ADHD across a range of measures of attention. Study 1 showed that 36.7% of adults with ASD met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria for current ADHD ""caseness"" (Barkley Current self-report scores questionnaire). Those with a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified were most likely to describe ADHD symptoms. The ASD group differed significantly from both the ADHD and control groups on total and individual symptom self-report scores. On neuropsychological testing, adults with ASD and ADHD showed comparable performance on tests of selective attention. Significant group differences were seen on measures of attentional switching; adults with ADHD were significantly faster and more inaccurate, and individuals with Asperger's syndrome showed a significantly slower and more accurate response style. Self-reported rates of ADHD among adults with ASD are significantly higher than in the general adult population and may be underdiagnosed. Adults with ASD have attentional difficulties on some neuropsychological measures."
23787482,Influence of the neuropsychological functions in theory of mind in schizophrenia: the false-belief/deception paradigm,Sol Fernandez-Gonzalo,"The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of neurocognition in a false-belief/deception theory of mind (ToM) task in a sample of patients with schizophrenia. In a cross-sectional study of 43 remitted patients, the implication of neurocognition in first- and second-order ToM stories was analyzed, controlling for clinical symptoms and duration of illness. None of the cognitive factors were associated with the first-order ToM stories. A logistic regression model with high specificity (96.3%) and sensitivity (75%) was obtained in the second-order ToM story ""The Burglar,"" the Information subtest (odds ratio [OR], 0.783; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-0.99; p = 0.04) and the Block Design subtest (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79-1; p = 0.056) of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III being the best predictive factors. Neurocognition was not related to first- or second-order ToM false-belief performance of the patients with schizophrenia. However, an influence of neuropsychological variables in the second-order ToM deception was observed. The clinical implications in the assessment of ToM are discussed."
23787345,Stacked autoencoders for unsupervised feature learning and multiple organ detection in a pilot study using 4D patient data,Hoo-Chang Shin,"Medical image analysis remains a challenging application area for artificial intelligence. When applying machine learning, obtaining ground-truth labels for supervised learning is more difficult than in many more common applications of machine learning. This is especially so for datasets with abnormalities, as tissue types and the shapes of the organs in these datasets differ widely. However, organ detection in such an abnormal dataset may have many promising potential real-world applications, such as automatic diagnosis, automated radiotherapy planning, and medical image retrieval, where new multimodal medical images provide more information about the imaged tissues for diagnosis. Here, we test the application of deep learning methods to organ identification in magnetic resonance medical images, with visual and temporal hierarchical features learned to categorize object classes from an unlabeled multimodal DCE-MRI dataset so that only a weakly supervised training is required for a classifier. A probabilistic patch-based method was employed for multiple organ detection, with the features learned from the deep learning model. This shows the potential of the deep learning model for application to medical images, despite the difficulty of obtaining libraries of correctly labeled training datasets and despite the intrinsic abnormalities present in patient datasets."
23786638,Are emotional intelligent workers also more empathic?,Maria Pilar Berrios Martos,"This paper analyzes whether emotional intelligence and self-monitoring are related to empathy among a sample of workers in both the public and private employment sectors. Two hundred and forty-two employees (42.5% men and 57.5% women) with a mean age of 35.21 years (SD = 10.07, range 18-61) completed a questionnaire that measured the variables of interest. The results showed that emotion regulation, a dimension of emotional intelligence, accounts for most of the variance of empathy, followed by the ability to understand emotions and the management of others' emotions. Furthermore, gender did not yield any moderator effect on the relations among emotional intelligence, self-monitoring and empathy. We conclude that the intrapersonal aspects of emotional intelligence, in particular, emotion regulation, help explain the empathy of workers. The implications of these findings are discussed herein."
23786210,Profile of cognitive deficits and associations with depressive symptoms and intelligence in chronic early-onset schizophrenia patients,Jens Richardt Møllegaard Jepsen,"Cognitive deficits in several domains have been demonstrated in early-onset schizophrenia patients but their profile and relation to depressive symptoms and intelligence need further characterization. The purpose was to characterize the profile of cognitive deficits in chronic, early-onset schizophrenia patients, assess the potential associations with depressive symptom severity, and examine whether cognitive deficits within several domains reflect intelligence impairments. This study compared attention, visual-construction, aspects of visual and verbal memory, and executive functions in chronic, early-onset schizophrenia patients (mean age = 20.7 years) (N = 18) and healthy controls (N = 38). Schizophrenia diagnoses were established at the time of the patients' first clinical presentation during childhood or adolescence and were confirmed five years later. In the chronic phase of early-onset schizophrenia, significant deficits were observed in all specific cognitive functions. The profile of cognitive deficits was jagged, and visual-construction, attention, and one aspect of verbal memory (verbal stories recall) were differentially impaired. Deficits of visual recall, visual recognition, and executive functions were accounted for by deficits in intelligence, while this was not the case for deficits of verbal recall of stories or attention. No significant associations were observed between the severity of cognitive deficits and that of depressive symptoms. Chronic, early-onset schizophrenia is characterized by a broad and jagged profile of cognitive deficits. Deficits of attention and verbal recall of stories appear not to be accounted for by deficits in intelligence, and the severity of cognitive deficits seems independent from that of depressive symptoms."
23785052,Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the early years: diagnostic issues and educational relevance,Sandra Schmiedeler,"In this study we discuss implications of the dimensional versus categorical approach in the diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and focus on the educational relevance of an early assessment. In a longitudinal study in a German community sample we investigated the development of ADHD symptoms from kindergarten until the end of Grade 1 as well as the association to pre-academic skills and later academic performance. At three time points in kindergarten, children (original sample N = 793; Mn age 4 years 10 months) were assessed in regard to school-relevant precursors of reading, spelling and mathematical abilities; ADHD symptoms were rated by parents and preschool teachers. In elementary school academic performance in reading, spelling, and mathematics was measured with standardized tests. Results show that stability of ADHD symptoms during preschool was high considering the dimensional approach, whereas in regard to the categorical classification many children crossing the cut-off point at one measurement point did not do so at the next assessment. Furthermore, preschool ADHD symptoms were negatively correlated with all school-relevant precursors. This was more pronounced for symptoms of inattention than for hyperactivity/impulsivity. Observing later development, preschool ADHD symptoms predicted academic achievement in mathematics and reading at the end of Grade 1 even after individual differences in nonverbal intelligence and specific precursors had been statistically controlled for."
23783296,Effects of long-chain PUFA supplementation in infant formula on cognitive function in later childhood,Peter Willatts,"Background: Evidence is accumulating that a dietary supply of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) enhances the development of attention and efficient information processing in infants. However, it is uncertain whether LC-PUFAs in infancy influence cognitive development in later childhood. Objective: The objective was to determine the effects of dietary LC-PUFAs in infancy on measures of cognitive function at age 6 y. Design: Infants were randomly assigned to receive formula containing either docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid or no LCPUFAs for a period of 4 mo. A reference breastfed group was also included. In a follow-up conducted at age 6 y, children received assessments of intelligence quotient (IQ), attention control (Day-Night Test), and speed of processing on the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT). Results: At follow-up there were 71 children in the LC-PUFA group, 76 in the control group, and 88 in the breastfed group. The formula groups did not differ on measures of Full-Scale IQ (LCPUFA mean = 98.0; control mean = 100.9) or attention control (LCPUFA mean = 12.7; control mean = 12.8). MFFT error scores were the same for both formula groups, but when making correct responses, the LC-PUFA group was significantly faster (mean = 6.2 s) than the control group [mean = 7.8 s; F(1, 131) = 6.09, P = 0.015]. Conclusions: IQ scores of children who were fed a formula containing either LC-PUFAs or no LC-PUFAs did not differ at age 6 y. However, children who received LC-PUFAs were faster at processing information compared with children who received unsupplemented formula. Variation in the dietary supply of LC-PUFAs in the first months of life may have long-term consequences for the development of some cognitive functions in later childhood."
23782895,Cognitive findings and behavior in children and adolescents with phenylketonuria,Simona Cappelletti,"Objective: The primary aim of this study was to assess cognitive development, in particular that of executive functions (EFs), and behavioral findings for patients with early treated phenylketonuria (PKU). Furthermore, we evaluated the relationships of our findings with plasma levels of Phe and adherence to dietary prescriptions. Methods: A cross-sectional design was adopted. Patients who had early treated PKU, who were older than 4 years, and who were regularly seen by a physician were enrolled in the study. Cognitive development was assessed with Wechsler Scales appropriate to the chronological age of subjects in the study. Executive functions were assessed using the Tower of London test, and behavioral findings were quantified with the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: Thirty-five patients were enrolled (mean age 11.5 years, SD ± 6.2). The mean Full Scale intelligence quotient was in the normal range (93.4 ± 17.4), without significant difference between the verbal intelligence quotient (mean, 94.3 ± 16.1) and performance intelligence quotient (mean, 93.9 ± 18.0). The majority of patients showed a deficit within the EF domain of cognitive abilities (mean lower than 1.8 SD of the normal mean), 8 of them showing a score <2 SD lower than the normal mean. Internalizing problems were also observed in 12 patients (38.7%) and were higher in adherent patients and in patients with a lower intelligence quotient. Conclusion: After early diagnosis and treatment of PKU, residual problems can be found in EFs of patients not achieving satisfactory Phe levels, while scores of internalizing behaviors were higher in compliant patients."
23782614,Crowdsourcing for bioinformatics,Benjamin M Good,"Motivation: Bioinformatics is faced with a variety of problems that require human involvement. Tasks like genome annotation, image analysis, knowledge-base population and protein structure determination all benefit from human input. In some cases, people are needed in vast quantities, whereas in others, we need just a few with rare abilities. Crowdsourcing encompasses an emerging collection of approaches for harnessing such distributed human intelligence. Recently, the bioinformatics community has begun to apply crowdsourcing in a variety of contexts, yet few resources are available that describe how these human-powered systems work and how to use them effectively in scientific domains. Results: Here, we provide a framework for understanding and applying several different types of crowdsourcing. The framework considers two broad classes: systems for solving large-volume 'microtasks' and systems for solving high-difficulty 'megatasks'. Within these classes, we discuss system types, including volunteer labor, games with a purpose, microtask markets and open innovation contests. We illustrate each system type with successful examples in bioinformatics and conclude with a guide for matching problems to crowdsourcing solutions that highlights the positives and negatives of different approaches."
23782564,Cognitive flexibility in adolescent patients with unipolar affective disorders-gender differences],L Sarrar,"Objective: Several studies have revealed impairments in cognitive functions among patients with affective disorders (AD). However, to date there are few neuropsychological studies on cognitive flexibility among adolescent patients with AD, especially on gender differences in AD. Here, we investigate cognitive functions, especially cognitive flexibility, in adolescent patients with unipolar AD (UAD) compared to a healthy control group (CG). Method: The study population consists of 17 male patients (M<inf>age</inf> = 15.4 ± 1.3) and 22 female patients with UAD (M<inf>age</inf> = 15.6 ± 1.4) as well as 20 male (M<inf>age</inf> = 16.0 ± 1.0) and 30 female (M<inf>age</inf> = 15.7 ± 0.9) healthy adolescents. A neuropsychological test battery was conducted, and depressive symptoms, psychological stress, and intelligence were also assessed. Results: The analyses revealed no significant group differences regarding cognitive flexibility or visual processing speed, albeit slight better performance in motor processing speed for the CG. Furthermore, no gender differences were observed regarding cognitive flexibility, though female subjects general displayed better performance in processing speed. Conclusions: Overall, there are no indications for serious deficits and specific gender differences in cognitive flexibility or processing speed in adolescent patients with UAD. Independent of psychological distress, female subjects seem to have some advantages in processing speed."
23782128,Effects of extended release methylphenidate treatment on ratings of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and associated behavior in children with autism spectrum disorders and ADHD symptoms,Deborah A Pearson,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the behavioral effects of four doses of psychostimulant medication, combining extended-release methylphenidate (MPH) in the morning with immediate-release MPH in the afternoon. Method: The sample comprised 24 children (19 boys; 5 girls) who met American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), and had significant symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This sample consisted of elementary school-age, community-based children (mean chronological age=8.8 years, SD=1.7; mean intelligence quotient [IQ]=85; SD=16.8). Effects of four dose levels of MPH on parent and teacher behavioral ratings were investigated using a within-subject, crossover, placebo-controlled design. Results: MPH treatment was associated with significant declines in hyperactive and impulsive behavior at both home and school. Parents noted significant declines in inattentive and oppositional behavior, and improvements in social skills. No exacerbation of stereotypies was noted, and side effects were similar to those seen in typically developing children with ADHD. Dose response was primarily linear in the dose range studied. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that MPH formulations are efficacious and well-tolerated for children with ASD and significant ADHD symptoms."
23781290,Real time dynamic imaging and current targeted therapies in the war on cancer: a new paradigm,Ramasamy Paulmurugan,"In biology, as every science student is made to learn, ontology recapitulates phylogeny. In medicine, however, oncology recapitulates polemology, the science of warfare: The medical establishment is transitioning from highly toxic poisons that kill rapidly dividing normal and malignant cells with little specificity to tailored therapies that target the tumors with the lethality of the therapeutic warhead. From the advent of the information age with the incorporation of high-tech intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance has resulted in ""data fusion"" where a wide range of information collected in near real-time can be used to redesign most of the treatment strategies currently used in the clinic. The medical community has begun to transition from the 'black box' of tumor therapy based solely on the clinical response to the 'glass box' of dynamic imaging designed to bring transparency to the clinical battlefield during treatment, thereby informing the therapeutic decision to 'retreat or repeat'. The tumor microenvironment is dynamic, constantly changing in response to therapeutic intervention, and therefore the therapeutic assessment must map to this variable and ever-changing landscape with dynamic and non-static imaging capabilities. The path to personalized medicine will require incorporation and integration of dynamic imaging at the bedside into clinical practice for real-time, interactive assessment of response to targeted therapies. The application of advanced real time imaging techniques along with current molecularly targeted anticancer therapies which alter cellular homeostasis and microenvironment can enhance therapeutic interventions in cancer patients and further improve the current status in clinical management of patients with advanced cancers."
23777939,Gray matter abnormalities in patients with narcissistic personality disorder,Lars Schulze,"Background: Despite the relevance of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) in clinical settings, there is currently no empirical data available regarding the neurobiological correlates of NPD. In the present study, we performed a voxel-based morphometric analysis to provide initial insight into local abnormalities of gray matter (GM) volume. Methods: Structural brain images were obtained from patients with NPD (n = 17) and a sample of healthy controls (n = 17) matched regarding age, gender, handedness, and intelligence. Groups were compared with regard to global brain tissue volumes and local abnormalities of GM volume. Regions-of-interest analyses were calculated for the anterior insula. Results: Relative to the control group, NPD patients had smaller GM volume in the left anterior insula. Independent of group, GM volume in the left anterior insula was positively related to self-reported emotional empathy. Complementary whole-brain analyses yielded smaller GM volume in fronto-paralimbic brain regions comprising the rostral and median cingulate cortex as well as dorsolateral and medial parts of the prefrontal cortex. Conclusion: Here we provide the first empirical evidence for structural abnormalities in fronto-paralimbic brain regions of patients with NPD. The results are discussed in the context of NPD patients' restricted ability for emotional empathy."
23776244,Underconnectivity between voice-selective cortex and reward circuitry in children with autism,Daniel A Abrams,"Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) often show insensitivity to the human voice, a deficit that is thought to play a key role in communication deficits in this population. The social motivation theory of ASD predicts that impaired function of reward and emotional systems impedes children with ASD from actively engaging with speech. Here we explore this theory by investigating distributed brain systems underlying human voice perception in children with ASD. Using resting-state functional MRI data acquired from 20 children with ASD and 19 age- and intelligence quotient-matched typically developing children, we examined intrinsic functional connectivity of voice-selective bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Children with ASD showed a striking pattern of underconnectivity between left-hemisphere pSTS and distributed nodes of the dopaminergic reward pathway, including bilateral ventral tegmental areas and nucleus accumbens, left-hemisphere insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Children with ASD also showed underconnectivity between right-hemisphere pSTS, a region known for processing speech prosody, and the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala, brain regions critical for emotion-related associative learning. The degree of underconnectivity between voice-selective cortex and reward pathways predicted symptom severity for communication deficits in children with ASD. Our results suggest that weak connectivity of voice-selective cortex and brain structures involved in reward and emotion may impair the ability of children with ASD to experience speech as a pleasurable stimulus, thereby impacting language and social skill development in this population. Our study provides support for the social motivation theory of ASD."
23776123,Impact of neonatal growth on IQ and behavior at early school age,Lisa G Smithers,"Objectives: The objective was to examine associations of neonatal weight gain (NWG) and head circumference gain (HCG) with IQ scores and behavior at early school age. Methods: We used data from the Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial, involving Belarusian infants born full term and weighing ≥2500 g. NWG and HCG were measured as the percentage gain in weight and head circumference over the first 4 weeks relative to birth size. IQ and behavior were measured at 6.5 years of age by using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), respectively, with SDQ collected from parents and teachers. The associations between the exposures (NWG, HCG) and children's IQ and SDQ were examined by using mixed models to account for clustering of measurements, and adjustment for potentially confounding perinatal and socioeconomic factors. Results: Mean NWG was 26% (SD 10%) of birth weight. In fully adjusted models, infants in the highest versus lowest quartile of NWG had 1.5-point (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8 to 2.2) higher IQ scores (n = 13 840). A weak negative (protective) association between NWG and SDQ total difficulties scores was observed for the teacher-reported (β = -0.39, 95% CI -0.71 to -0.08, n = 12 016), but not the parent-reported (β = -0.12, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.15, n = 13 815), SDQ. Similar associations were observed with HCG and IQ and behavior. Conclusions: Faster gains in weight or head circumference in the 4 weeks after birth may contribute to children's IQ, but reverse causality (brain function affects neonatal growth) cannot be excluded."
23776091,Smart nanomachines based on DNA self-assembly,Chen Song,"DNA-based nanomachines are self-assembled DNA superstructures that harness chemical free energy to perform mechanical work. The development of DNA machines has benefited greatly from the achievements in both structural and dynamic DNA nanotechnology. In this review, the configurations of DNA machines, fuel systems, and operations are discussed to outline the evolving paths of DNA machines. The focus is on the smart mechanical behavior of DNA machines, from the standpoint of upgrading the complexity of DNA nanostructures, cooperative activation of multimachinary systems, and the establishment of a network of the mechanical states. In the end, the challenges are highlighted and possible solutions are proposed to push forward smart DNA nanomachines, with the goal of creating biomimicking systems. Insights are also provided into the potential applications of the DNA machines with designable intelligence."
23775979,In vivo radioligand binding to translocator protein correlates with severity of Alzheimer's disease,William C Kreisl,"Neuroinflammation is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, but its role in cognitive impairment and its course of development during the disease are largely unknown. To address these unknowns, we used positron emission tomography with (11)C-PBR28 to measure translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a putative biomarker for inflammation. Patients with Alzheimer's disease, patients with mild cognitive impairment and older control subjects were also scanned with (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound B to measure amyloid burden. Twenty-nine amyloid-positive patients (19 Alzheimer's, 10 mild cognitive impairment) and 13 amyloid-negative control subjects were studied. The primary goal of this study was to determine whether TSPO binding is elevated in patients with Alzheimer's disease, and the secondary goal was to determine whether TSPO binding correlates with neuropsychological measures, grey matter volume, (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound B binding, or age of onset. Patients with Alzheimer's disease, but not those with mild cognitive impairment, had greater (11)C-PBR28 binding in cortical brain regions than controls. The largest differences were seen in the parietal and temporal cortices, with no difference in subcortical regions or cerebellum. (11)C-PBR28 binding inversely correlated with performance on Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes, Logical Memory Immediate (Wechsler Memory Scale Third Edition), Trail Making part B and Block Design (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Third Edition) tasks, with the largest correlations observed in the inferior parietal lobule. (11)C-PBR28 binding also inversely correlated with grey matter volume. Early-onset (<65 years) patients had greater (11)C-PBR28 binding than late-onset patients, and in parietal cortex and striatum (11)C-PBR28 binding correlated with lower age of onset. Partial volume corrected and uncorrected results were generally in agreement; however, the correlation between (11)C-PBR28 and (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound B binding was seen only after partial volume correction. The results suggest that neuroinflammation, indicated by increased (11)C-PBR28 binding to TSPO, occurs after conversion of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease and worsens with disease progression. Greater inflammation may contribute to the precipitous disease course typically seen in early-onset patients. (11)C-PBR28 may be useful in longitudinal studies to mark the conversion from mild cognitive impairment or to assess response to experimental treatments of Alzheimer's disease."
23775674,Assisted cycling exercise improves fine manual dexterity in persons with Down's syndrome,C-C J J Chen,"Background: This study was aimed at investigating the impact of assisted cycling therapy (ACT) on fine manual dexterity in adults with Down's syndrome (DS). Methods: Nine persons with DS completed four different interventions: voluntary exercise (VE), voluntary with music (VEM), assisted exercise (AE) and no exercise (NE). Fine manual dexterity (e.g., Purdue Pegboard) was tested pre and post interventions. Results: The results showed dominant and bimanual hands were improved after AE but no evident in either subtest after VE. The assembly subtest, processed by spatial-temporal ability, was only improved after VEM and NE. Conclusions: It is speculated that AE stimulated more peripheral sensory input to the motor cortex and neurotransmitters than the other interventions. In addition, the involvement of music may enhance spatial intelligence during VEM. Even though the exact mechanisms are still unknown, the implication of our results showed that AE and VEM can improve fine manual dexterity in persons with DS."
23774955,"""Insight"" in pigeons: absence of means-end processing in displacement tests",Robert G Cook,"The understanding of functional relations between action and consequence is a critical component of intelligence. To examine this linkage in pigeons, we investigated their understanding of the relations of the elements tested in an extension of Köhler's box stacking task to this species. In the experiments, the pigeons had to move a spatially displaced box under an out-of-reach target. Experiment 1 successfully replicated and extended the previous finding showing that when separately trained to move a box and stand on it to peck the target, pigeons can synthesize these behaviors to solve the single-box displacement problem quickly on their first attempt. Experiment 2 tested whether pigeons, when given a simultaneous choice between two boxes with identical reinforcement histories, would selectively choose the box with the correct functional affordance (i.e., permitting standing) to solve the problem rather than a non-functional one. Their extensive, equivalent, and undirected behavior in moving both boxes during these tests suggests the pigeons did not possess a means-end understanding of the functional properties of the boxes. Instead, their results were consistent with an analysis of their earlier synthetic behavior as being due to the temporal and spatial relations of the physical elements in the task and their prior learned behaviors."
23773035,"Testing the difficulty theory of the SON-R 5(1/2)-17, a non-verbal test of intelligence",Hanneke Geerlings,"Fischer's (1973) linear logistic test model can be used to test hypotheses regarding the effect of covariates on item difficulty and to predict the difficulty of newly constructed test items. However, its assumptions of equal discriminatory power across items and a perfect prediction of item difficulty are never absolutely met. The amount of misfit in an application of a Bayesian version of the model to two subtests of the SON-R 5(1/2)-17 is investigated by means of item fit statistics in the framework of posterior predictive checks and by means of a comparison with a model that allows for residual (co)variance in the item parameters. The effect of the degree of residual (co)variance on the robustness of inferences is investigated in a simulation study."
23772353,Cochlear implant considerations in children with additional disabilities,C Eduardo Corrales,"Early identification and management of disabilities in children are essential to reduce long-term developmental sequelae. Many of the causes of hearing loss also produce cognitive delays resulting in a large number of children with both deafness and developmental disabilities. Children who have hearing loss and additional disabilities require complex, individualized therapy to maximize their long-term quality of life. Hearing loss is often detected early because of widespread newborn hearing screening programs and the decision for cochlear implantation in children presenting with multiple medical and developmental disorders is still evolving. This article will review the literature regarding cochlear implant considerations in children with additional developmental disabilities in areas of family perception, speech and language development, cognitive development including adaptive behavior and intelligence, communication and functional skills, auditory outcomes, quality of life outcomes, predictors of outcomes and realistic expectations after cochlear implantation."
23770126,Prenatal methyl mercury exposure in relation to neurodevelopment and behavior at 19 years of age in the Seychelles Child Development Study,E van Wijngaarden,"Background: Fish are important sources of protein and contain a variety of nutrients, such as n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), essential for normal brain development. Nevertheless, all fish also contain methyl mercury (MeHg), a known neurotoxicant in adequate dosage. Our studies of the Seychelles Child Development Study (SCDS) Main Cohort enrolled in 1989-1990 (n=779) have found no consistent pattern of adverse MeHg effects at exposures achieved by daily fish consumption. Rather, we have observed evidence of improved performance on some cognitive endpoints as prenatal MeHg exposure increases in the range studied. These observations cannot be related to MeHg and may reflect the role of unmeasured covariates such as essential nutrients present in fish. To determine if these associations persist into young adulthood, we examined the relationship between prenatal MeHg exposure, recent PUFA exposure and subjects' neurodevelopment and behavior at 19 years of age. Methods: We examined 533 participants using the following test battery: the Profile of Mood States-Bipolar (POMS-Bi); Finger Tapping; Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT); measures of Fine Motor Control and Complex Perceptual Motor Control; and Visual Spatial Contrast Sensitivity. We collected the following covariates: maternal IQ, family life course stressors, socioeconomic status, and subjects' recent postnatal MeHg, sex, and computer use. Primary analyses (based on N=392-475) examined covariate-adjusted associations in multiple linear regression models with prenatal MeHg as the primary exposure measure. Secondary analyses additionally adjusted for total n-6 and fish-related n-3 PUFA measured in the subjects' serum at the 19-year examination. Results: Study participants had a mean prenatal MeHg exposure of 6.9 ppm, and a mean recent postnatal exposure of 10.3 ppm. There were no adverse associations between prenatal MeHg and any of the measured endpoints. For recent postnatal MeHg exposure, however, adverse associations were observed for Finger Tapping (non-dominant hand) among women and for the K-BIT Matrices for both sexes, with or without adjustment for PUFA. Conclusion: Our findings continue to provide no evidence for an adverse effect of prenatal MeHg exposure on development in a cohort that consumes fish daily. Observations for postnatal MeHg exposure will need to be confirmed using more comprehensive exposure measures."
23769089,Supporting liver transplantation by clinical pathway intelligence,K Kirchner,"A reproducible and transparent quality of clinical treatments plays an important role in the performance of a hospital. In liver transplantation (LT), this is particularly important for patient safety, resource planning, documentation, and quality management. Thus, the clinical pathway for LT was documented in an electronic format within our research project PIGE. Data from clinical information systems were linked to this pathway, which allows for process monitoring (the assessment of the current state for every patient in the LT process) and a retrospective analysis of all treatments in addition to all data pertaining to the treatment, for example, cost, time, number of personnel, etc."
23768817,Use of early remedial services in children with transposition of the great arteries,Johanna Calderon,"Objectives: To characterize the prevalence of use of early remedial services and its associated demographic, medical, and cognitive factors in children aged 4-6 years with corrected transposition of the great arteries (TGA). Study design: This was a prospective study of neurocognitive outcomes after TGA. Children underwent formal neuropsychological testing including general intelligence and a comprehensive battery of executive functions (EF) including motor and interference control, short-term memory, and working memory as well as cognitive flexibility. Parental reports on the children's behavior and EF were also evaluated. Demographic factors and preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative factors as well as cognitive factors were examined according to the current use of remediation. Results: Forty-five patients (67% male) and their parents participated in this study. Twenty-four (53%) patients were receiving remedial services. Male sex, a postnatal diagnosis of TGA, and a longer postoperative intensive care unit stay were significantly associated with use of remediation. Children receiving remediation had lower EF scores, had more severe EF deficits as observed by formal testing, and were rated as having more behavioral daily life difficulties. However, in the group without remediation, 13 children (43%) also displayed EF deficits rated as moderate to severe. Conclusions: Demographic and medical factors could help identify children at higher risk for neurocognitive delays. Evaluation of executive functioning from an early age may influence referral for remediation."
23768423,Computational intelligence for the Balanced Scorecard: studying performance trends of hemodialysis clinics,Isabella Cattinelli,"Objectives: The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is a general, widely employed instrument for enterprise performance monitoring based on the periodic assessment of strategic Key Performance Indicators that are scored against preset targets. The BSC is currently employed as an effective management support tool within Fresenius Medical Care (FME) and is routinely analyzed via standard statistical methods. More recently, the application of computational intelligence techniques (namely, self-organizing maps) to BSC data has been proposed as a way to enhance the quantity and quality of information that can be extracted from it. In this work, additional methods are presented to analyze the evolution of clinic performance over time. Methods: Performance evolution is studied at the single-clinic level by computing two complementary indexes that measure the proportion of time spent within performance clusters and improving/worsening trends. Self-organizing maps are used in conjunction with these indexes to identify the specific drivers of the observed performance. The performance evolution for groups of clinics is modeled under a probabilistic framework by resorting to Markov chain properties. These allow a study of the probability of transitioning between performance clusters as time progresses for the identification of the performance level that is expected to become dominant over time. Results: We show the potential of the proposed methods through illustrative results derived from the analysis of BSC data of 109 FME clinics in three countries. We were able to identify the performance drivers for specific groups of clinics and to distinguish between countries whose performances are likely to improve from those where a decline in performance might be expected. According to the stationary distribution of the Markov chain, the expected trend is best in Turkey (where the highest performance cluster has the highest probability, P=0.46), followed by Portugal (where the second best performance cluster dominates, with P=0.50), and finally Italy (where the second best performance cluster has P=0.34). Conclusion: These results highlight the ability of the proposed methods to extract insights about performance trends that cannot be easily extrapolated using standard analyses and that are valuable in directing management strategies within a continuous quality improvement policy."
23768250,Add-on clinical effects of selective antagonist of 5HT6 receptors AVN-211 (CD-008-0173) in patients with schizophrenia stabilized on antipsychotic treatment: pilot study,Margarita A Morozova,"The serotoninergic system as a target for add-on treatment seems to be a promising approach in patients with schizophrenia. Objective: To clarify if selective 5HT-6 antagonist AVN-211 (CD-008-0173) adds clinical and cognitive effects to stable antipsychotic treatment. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on, 4r-week trial in 47 schizophrenia patients (21 patients receiving study drug and 26 receiving placebo) who were stabilized on antipsychotic medication was performed. Seventeen patients from the study drug group and 25 patients from the placebo group completed the trial. Treatment effects were measured using clinical rating scales and attention tests. Results: With no differences at baseline, there was a significant difference between the groups in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive subscale score (p = 0.058) in favor of patients in the treatment group at the endpoint. The PANSS positive subscore (p = 0.0068) and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) (p = 0.048) score significantly changed only in the treatment group. Only in the placebo group were significant changes in Calgary Depression Rating Scale (CDRS) total score registered. The indices of attention tests at endpoint did not show differences between the groups, with the exception of the scope of change in the results of the subtest VIII of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), which showed difference between the groups (p = 0.02) and was significantly larger in the treatment group. Only inside the study drug group, significant changes in selectivity and continuous attention were observed regarding total correct responses (p = 0.0038) and reaction time (p = 0.058) in the Continuous Attention Task (CAT) test. Conclusion: Selective 5HT6 antagonist AVN-211 (CD-008-0173) added antipsychotic and some procognitive (attention) effects to antipsychotic medication."
23767925,Global increase in task-related fronto-parietal activity after focal frontal lobe lesion,Alexandra Woolgar,"A critical question for neuropsychology is how complex brain networks react to damage. Here, we address this question for the well-known executive control or multiple-demand (MD) system, a fronto-parietal network showing increased activity with many different kinds of cognitive demand, including standard tests of fluid intelligence. Using fMRI, we ask how focal frontal lobe damage affects MD activity during a standard fluid intelligence task. Despite poor behavioral performance, frontal patients showed increased fronto-parietal activity relative to controls. The activation difference was not accounted for by difference in IQ. Moreover, rather than specific focus on perilesional or contralesional cortex, additional recruitment was distributed throughout the MD regions and surrounding cortex and included parietal MD regions distant from the injury. The data suggest that, following local frontal lobe damage, there is a global compensatory recruitment of an adaptive and integrated fronto-parietal network."
23767921,Longitudinal working memory development is related to structural maturation of frontal and parietal cortices,Christian K Tamnes,"Parallels between patterns of brain maturation and cognitive development have been observed repeatedly, but studies directly testing the relationships between improvements in specific cognitive functions and structural changes in the brain are lacking. Working memory development extends throughout childhood and adolescence and likely plays a central role for cognitive development in multiple domains and in several neurodevelopmental disorders. Neuroimaging, lesion, and electrophysiological studies indicate that working memory emerges from coordinated interactions of a distributed neural network in which fronto-parietal cortical regions are critical. In the current study, verbal working memory function, as indexed by performance on the Keep Track task, and volumes of brain regions were assessed at two time points in 79 healthy children and adolescents in the age range of 8-22 years. Longitudinal change in cortical and subcortical volumes was quantified by the use of Quantitative Anatomical Regional Change. Improvement in working memory was related to cortical volume reduction in bilateral prefrontal and posterior parietal regions and in regions around the central sulci. Importantly, these relationships were not explained by differences in gender, age, or intelligence level or change in intellectual abilities. Furthermore, the relationships did not interact with age and were not significantly different in children, young adolescents, and old adolescents. The results provide the first direct evidence that structural maturation of a fronto-parietal cortical network supports working memory development."
23767697,Age-related change in Wechsler IQ norms after adjustment for the Flynn effect: estimates from three computational models,Kristina A Agbayani,"A previous study found that the Flynn effect accounts for 85% of the normative difference between 20- and 70-year-olds on subtests of the Wechsler intelligence tests. Adjusting scores for the Flynn effect substantially reduces normative age-group differences, but the appropriate amount of adjustment is uncertain. The present study replicates previous findings and employs two other methods of adjusting for the Flynn effect. Averaged across models, results indicate that the Flynn effect accounts for 76% of normative age-group differences on Wechsler IQ subtests. Flynn-effect adjustment reduces the normative age-related decline in IQ from 4.3 to 1.1 IQ points per decade."
23767381,EIWA-III measures of cognitive function in young Puerto Rico patients with epilepsy,Karla Narváez Pérez,"Evaluation and measurement of intelligence contributes significantly to the scientific endeavor of psychology as a science. This study was exploratory and descriptive, with twenty young patients with epilepsy from Puerto Rico of ages between 16-20 years. Compared the execution of a matched group of the normative sample and the group of adults 21 to 64 years with epilepsy belonging to the standardization sample in Puerto Rico. The data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical calculations. Survey results reflect significant differences in the scores of the subtests that make up the intelligence scale EIWA-III. In all measures, the group of participants with epilepsy rate was lower than the reference group. The comparison of scores on the subtests that measure executive functions was analyzed by the working memory index (WMI). Based on the data obtained, the performance in executive functions EIWA-III is significantly lower in participants with epilepsy compared to the reference groups. Analysis of variance/ANOVA showed no significant differences between IQ scale for implementation (F = 8.77) with a probability of 0.001, CI scale (F = 4.35) was 0.01 and verbal scale IQ (F = 2.67) was 0.05 for the group of young patients from 16 to 20 years with epilepsy, their IQ score compared with the normative group on the subscales that comprise the Verbal Scale, Performance and Total rates of IQ trial EIWA-III. In light of these results, the statistically significant differences for each subscale: Verbal IQ, Performance, Total and indexes EIWA-III, suggest that the level of intelligence of sample group, 16 to 20 years old with epilepsy, was below average in comparison with the normative group. The results are consistent with the literature on cognitive neuropsychology and performance of subjects with epileptic diseases."
23766675,"Autism, processing speed, and adaptive functioning in preschool children",Åsa Hedvall,"Objectives: To study cognitive test profiles with a focus on processing speed in a representative group of preschool children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and relate processing speed to adaptive functioning. Methods: Cognitive assessments were performed in 190 3.6-6.6-year-old children (164 boys and 26 girls) with ASD, using either Griffiths' developmental scales (n = 77) or the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Third Edition (WPPSI-III) (n = 113). Cognitive data were related to adaptive functioning as measured by Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). Results: Cognitive profiles were characterized by low verbal skills. Low processing speed quotients (PSQs) were found in 66 (78%) of the 85 children who were able to participate in the processing speed subtests. Except for Socialization, all VABS domains (Communication, Motor Skills, Daily Living Skills, and Adaptive Behavior Composite scores) correlated significantly with PSQ. Multiple regression analysis showed that PSQ predicted 38%, 35%, 34%, and 37% of the variance for Communication, Daily Living Skills, Motor Skills, and total Adaptive Composite scores, respectively. Conclusion: Preschool children with ASD had uneven cognitive profiles with low verbal skills, and, relatively, even lower PSQs. Except for Socialization, adaptive functioning was predicted to a considerable degree by PSQ."
23764236,Predicting acute aquatic toxicity of structurally diverse chemicals in fish using artificial intelligence approaches,Kunwar P Singh,"The research aims to develop global modeling tools capable of categorizing structurally diverse chemicals in various toxicity classes according to the EEC and European Community directives, and to predict their acute toxicity in fathead minnow using set of selected molecular descriptors. Accordingly, artificial intelligence approach based classification and regression models, such as probabilistic neural networks (PNN), generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPN), radial basis function neural network (RBFN), support vector machines (SVM), gene expression programming (GEP), and decision tree (DT) were constructed using the experimental toxicity data. Diversity and non-linearity in the chemicals' data were tested using the Tanimoto similarity index and Brock-Dechert-Scheinkman statistics. Predictive and generalization abilities of various models constructed here were compared using several statistical parameters. PNN and GRNN models performed relatively better than MLPN, RBFN, SVM, GEP, and DT. Both in two and four category classifications, PNN yielded a considerably high accuracy of classification in training (95.85 percent and 90.07 percent) and validation data (91.30 percent and 86.96 percent), respectively. GRNN rendered a high correlation between the measured and model predicted -log LC50 values both for the training (0.929) and validation (0.910) data and low prediction errors (RMSE) of 0.52 and 0.49 for two sets. Efficiency of the selected PNN and GRNN models in predicting acute toxicity of new chemicals was adequately validated using external datasets of different fish species (fathead minnow, bluegill, trout, and guppy). The PNN and GRNN models showed good predictive and generalization abilities and can be used as tools for predicting toxicities of structurally diverse chemical compounds."
23763612,Emotional rescue: the role of emotional intelligence and emotional labour on well-being and job-stress among community nurses,Leila Karimi,"Aims: To investigate the extent to which emotional labour and emotional intelligence are associated with well-being and job-stress among a group of Australian community nurses. The moderating role of emotional intelligence was evaluated as a key factor in the rescue of healthcare workers from job-stress, thus increasing job retention. Background: Although emotional labour has been broadly investigated in the literature, the contribution of emotional labour and emotional intelligence to the well-being and experience of job-stress in a community nursing setting requires further exploration. Design: This study used a cross-sectional quantitative research design with data collected from Australian community nurses. Methods: Australian community nurses (n = 312) reported on their perceived emotional labour, emotional intelligence and their levels of well-being and job-stress using a paper and pencil survey in 2010. Results/findings: Results from structural equation modelling support the hypothesis that both emotional labour and emotional intelligence have significant effects on nurses' well-being and perceived job-stress. Emotional intelligence plays a moderating role in the experience of job-stress. Conclusion: These findings provide additional evidence for the important effects that emotional labour and emotional intelligence can have on well-being and job-stress among community nurses. The potential benefits of emotional intelligence in the nurses' emotional work have been explored."
23763442,Cognitive outcome of very-low-birthweight infants at 6 years of age,Toshimitsu Takayanagi,"Background: The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics of the cognitive function in very-low-birth-weight infants (VLBWI) at 6 years of age and investigate significant factors during neonatal intensive care unit admission that affect cognitive outcomes. Methods: One hundred and eighty-nine VLBWI (28.4 weeks, 1024 g), including 93 extremely low-birthweight (EL) infants whose birthweight was <1000 g (26.8 weeks, 759 g) and 96 very low-birthweight (VL) infants whose birthweight was 1000-1499 g (30.0 weeks, 1281 g), were enrolled. The cognitive function was measured using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children version 3, three IQ tests, four factor indices and 13 subtest scores. Regression analyses were performed to analyze the cognitive indices and clinical variables during neonatal intensive care unit admission. Results: The full-scale IQ (FIQ) in the EL infants was 85.3 ± 13.4, which was significantly lower than the 91.8 ± 9.7 observed in the VL infants. The verbal IQ and performance IQ in the EL infants were also lower than those observed in the VL infants. The rate of difference between verbal IQ and performance IQ >14 was 20% in the EL infants and 22% in the VL infants. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant relation between FIQ and HC (P = 0.002) and FIQ and dexamethasone (P = 0.012). Conclusion: In comparison with that observed in the VL infants, the intelligence quotient of the EL infants was inferior and exhibited more inter-individual variation. Intra-individual imbalances of the cognitive function were highly observed irrespective of the EL or VL status. Restriction of intrauterine brain growth and greater doses of dexamethasone may be harmful for subsequent cognitive outcomes."
23762357,The role of intelligence in posttraumatic stress disorder: does it vary by trauma severity?,Naomi Breslau,"Background: Only a small minority of trauma victims develops post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suggesting that victims vary in their predispositions to the PTSD response to stressors. It is assumed that the role of predispositions in PTSD varies by trauma severity: when stressors are less severe, predispositions play a bigger role. In this study, we test whether the role of intelligence in PTSD varies by trauma severity. Specifically, does low intelligence plays a bigger part among victims of lower magnitude stressors than among victims of extreme stressors? Methods: Data come from a longitudinal study of randomly selected sample in Southeast Michigan (n = 713). IQ was measured at age 6. PTSD was measured at age 17, using the NIMH-DIS for DSM-IV. Stressors were classified as extreme if they involved assaultive violence (e.g. rape, sexual assault, threatened with a weapon); other stressors in the list (e.g. disaster, accidents) were classified as lower magnitude. Assaultive violence victims had experienced assaultive violence plus other event types or only assaultive violence. Victims of other stressors were participants who had never experienced assaultive violence. We compared the influence of age 6 IQ on PTSD among persons exposed to assaultive violence vs. other stressors, using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Relative risk ratio (RRR) for PTSD associated with a one point drop in age 6 IQ among victims of assaultive violence was 1.04 (95% CI 1.01, 1.06); among victims of other stressors, it was 1.03 (95% CI 0.99, 1.06). A comparison of the two RRRs indicates no significant difference between the two estimates (p = 0.652). IQ does not play a bigger role in PTSD among victims of other stressors than it does among victims of assaultive violence. Conclusions: Lower IQ exerts an adverse PTSD effect on trauma victims, with no evidence of variability by the severity of trauma they have experienced."
23761751,"Brains, innovations, tools and cultural transmission in birds, non-human primates, and fossil hominins",Louis Lefebvre,"Recent work on birds and non-human primates has shown that taxonomic differences in field measures of innovation, tool use and social learning are associated with size of the mammalian cortex and avian mesopallium and nidopallium, as well as ecological traits like colonization success. Here, I review this literature and suggest that many of its findings are relevant to hominin intelligence. In particular, our large brains and increased intelligence may be partly independent of our ape phylogeny and the result of convergent processes similar to those that have molded avian and platyrrhine intelligence. Tool use, innovativeness and cultural transmission might be linked over our past and in our brains as operations of domain-general intelligence. Finally, colonization of new areas may have accompanied increases in both brain size and innovativeness in hominins as they have in other mammals and in birds, potentially accelerating hominin evolution via behavioral drive."
23760789,Genetic and environmental variation in lung function drives subsequent variation in aging of fluid intelligence,Deborah Finkel,"Longitudinal studies document an association of pulmonary function with cognitive function in middle-aged and older adults. Previous analyses have identified a genetic contribution to the relationship between pulmonary function with fluid intelligence. The goal of the current analysis was to apply the biometric dual change score model to consider the possibility of temporal dynamics underlying the genetic covariance between aging trajectories for pulmonary function and fluid intelligence. Longitudinal data from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging were available from 808 twins ranging in age from 50 to 88 years at the first wave. Participants completed up to six assessments covering a 19-year period. Measures at each assessment included spatial and speed factors and pulmonary function. Model-fitting indicated that genetic variance for FEV1 was a leading indicator of variation in age changes for spatial and speed factors. Thus, these data indicate a genetic component to the directional relationship from decreased pulmonary function to decreased function of fluid intelligence."
23760222,Do general intellectual functioning and socioeconomic status account for performance on the Children's Gambling Task?,Fernanda Mata,"Studies that use the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and its age-appropriate versions as indices of affective decision-making during childhood and adolescence have demonstrated significant individual differences in scores. Our study investigated the association between general intellectual functioning and socioeconomic status (SES) and its effect on the development of affective decision-making in preschoolers by using a computerized version of the Children's Gambling Task (CGT). We administered the CGT and the Columbia Mental Maturity Scale (CMMS) to 137 Brazilian children between the ages of 3 and 5 years old to assess their general intellectual functioning. We also used the Brazilian Criterion of Economic Classification (CCEB) to assess their SES. Age differences between 3- and 4-years-old, but not between 4- and 5-years-old, confirmed the results obtained by Kerr and Zelazo (2004), indicating the rapid development of affective decision-making during the preschool period. Both 4- and 5-years-old performed significantly above chance on blocks 3, 4, and 5 of the CGT, whereas 3-years-old mean scores did not differ from chance. We found that general intellectual functioning was not related to affective decision-making. On the other hand, our findings showed that children with high SES performed better on the last block of the CGT in comparison to children with low SES, which indicates that children from the former group seem more likely to use the information about the gain/loss aspects of the decks to efficiently choose cards from the advantageous deck throughout the task."
23758403,Cognitive outcome in childhood after unilateral perinatal brain injury,Lenny M van Buuren,"Aim: The aim of the study was to assess cognitive outcome in children with periventricular haemorrhagic infarction (PVHI) or perinatal arterial ischaemic stroke (PAIS) and relate these findings to early developmental outcome and neonatal magnetic resonance imaging findings. Method: A neuropsychological assessment was performed in 50 children (26 males, 24 females) with unilateral PVHI (n=21) or PAIS (n=29) at a median age of 11 years 9 months (range 6-20y). This included tests for intelligence, verbal memory, visual-motor integration, word comprehension, attention, reaction times, and executive function. The Griffiths Mental Development Scale was used for early developmental assessment at 24 months (range 18-32mo). Results: In children with PVHI, both the early Griffiths scores (mean 87; 95% CI 83-92) and the Full-scale IQ (FSIQ) scores at school age (mean 86; 95% CI 78-94) were below the test mean of 100. In the PAIS group, early Griffiths scores were within the normal range (mean 98; 95% CI 93-104), but at school age FSIQ scores were below average (mean 87; 95% CI 80-94). In children with PVHI, FSIQ scores correlated with the level of maternal education and were lower after ventricular dilatation, whereas both involvement of the basal ganglia and thalami and development of postneonatal epilepsy were associated with lower cognitive outcome in children who had experienced PAIS. Interpretation: Cognitive outcome after PVHI or PAIS is below average, but still within 1SD for most children. Prediction of cognitive outcome remains challenging, but some early predictors can be recognized."
23729764,Collaborative Chronic Care Networks (C3Ns) to transform chronic illness care,Peter A Margolis,"Despite significant gains by pediatric collaborative improvement networks, the overall US system of chronic illness care does not work well. A new paradigm is needed: a Collaborative Chronic Care Network (C3N). A C3N is a network-based production system that harnesses the collective intelligence of patients, clinicians, and researchers and distributes the production of knowledge, information, and know-how over large groups of people, dramatically accelerating the discovery process. A C3N is a platform of ""operating systems"" on which interconnected processes and interventions are designed, tested, and implemented. The social operating system is facilitated by community building, engaging all stakeholders and their expertise, and providing multiple ways to participate. Standard progress measures and a robust information technology infrastructure enable the technical operating system to reduce unwanted variation and adopt advances more rapidly. A structured approach to innovation design provides a scientific operating system or ""laboratory"" for what works and how to make it work. Data support testing and research on multiple levels: comparative effectiveness research for populations, evaluating care delivery processes at the care center level, and N-of-1 trials and other methods to select the best treatment of individual patient circumstances. Methods to reduce transactional costs to participate include a Federated IRB Model in which centers rely on a protocol approved at 1 central institutional review board and a ""commons framework"" for organizational copyright and intellectual property concerns. A fully realized C3N represents a discontinuous leap to a self-developing learning health system capable of producing a qualitatively different approach to improving health."
23756737,Postoperative increase in cerebral white matter fractional anisotropy on diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging is associated with cognitive improvement after uncomplicated carotid endarterectomy: tract-based spatial statistics analysis,Yuiko Sato,"Background: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) might improve cognitive function. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the cerebral white matter derived from diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) correlate with cognitive function in patients with various central nervous system diseases. Objective: To use tract-based spatial statistics to determine whether postoperative changes of FA values in the cerebral white matter derived from DTI are associated with cognitive improvement after uncomplicated CEA. Methods: In 80 patients undergoing CEA for ipsilateral internal carotid artery stenosis (≥70%), FA values in the cerebral white matter were derived from DTI before and 1 month after surgery and were analyzed by using tract-based spatial statistics. Neuropsychological testing, consisting of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised, the Wechsler Memory Scale and the Rey-Osterreith Complex Figure test, was also performed preoperatively and after the first postoperative month. Results: Based on the neuropsychological assessments, 11 (14%) patients were defined as having postoperatively improved cognition. The difference between the 2 mean FA values (postoperative values minus preoperative values) in the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to surgery was significantly associated with postoperative cognitive improvement (95% confidence intervals, 2.632-9.877; P = .008). White matter FA values in patients with postoperative cognitive improvement were significantly increased after surgery in the whole ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere, in the contralateral anterior cerebral artery territory, and in the watershed zone between the contralateral anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Conclusion: Postoperative increase in cerebral white matter FA on DTI is associated with cognitive improvement after uncomplicated CEA."
23756297,Adapting and evaluating a social cognitive remediation program for schizophrenia in Arabic,Sherif M Gohar,"Although growing evidence supports the efficacy of social cognitive training interventions for schizophrenia, nearly all studies to date have been conducted in Westernized countries. In the current study, we translated and adapted an existing social cognitive skills training (SCST) program into Arabic and conducted a preliminary efficacy evaluation in schizophrenia outpatients in Egypt. Twenty-two patients were randomized to 16 sessions of group-based SCST and 20 were randomized to a format- and time-matched illness management training control condition. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included a primary social cognition outcome measure that assessed four branches of emotional intelligence and a battery of neurocognitive tests. The SCST group demonstrated significant treatment effects on total emotional intelligence scores (F=24.31, p<.001), as well as the sub-areas of Identifying Emotions (F=11.77, p<.001) and Managing Emotions (F=23.27, p<.001), compared with those in the control condition. There were no treatment benefits for neurocognition for either condition, and both interventions were well-tolerated by patients. These initial results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing social cognitive interventions in different cultural settings with relatively minor modifications. The findings are encouraging regarding further efforts to maximize the benefits of social cognitive interventions internationally."
23755036,Subthreshold Depressive Symptoms have a Negative Impact on Cognitive Functioning in Middle-Aged and Older Males,Erlend J Brevik,"Introduction: Cognitive aging is associated with a decline on measures of fluid intelligence (gF), whereas crystallized intelligence (gC) tends to remain stable. In the present study we asked if depressive symptoms might contribute to explain the decline on gF in a sample of healthy middle-aged and older adults. Method: The Norwegian sample included 83 females and 42 males (M = 60, SD = 7.9 years). gF was calculated from factor-analysis, including tests of matrix reasoning (WASI), memory function (CVLT-II), processing speed and executive function (CDT; CWIT). gC was derived from a Vocabulary subtest (WASI). Depressive symptoms were assessed by self-reports on Beck's Depression Index (BDI) and ranged from 0 to 21 (M = 6, SD = 4.5). Results: Increased age was correlated with a decline on gF (r = -0.436, p < 0.001), but not gC (r=-0.103, p = ns.). The BDI score in the whole sample was correlated with gF (r = -0.313, p < 0.001). A more detailed analysis showed that the BDI score correlated with measures of both gF and gC in males. The correlations were non-significant for females on all measures, with the exception of a measure of processing speed/executive function. A regression analysis including age and sex in the first step, showed that symptoms of depression significantly contributed to explain decline on gF, F(3, 124) = 16.653, p < 0.001, R? = 0.292, ΔR? = 0.054. Discussion: The results showed that symptoms of depression were negatively correlated with cognitive functioning in males even when the symptom-level was below clinical threshold. This indicates that minimal symptoms of depression in older men are clinically relevant to address."
23754428,Evolution of working memory,Peter Carruthers,"Working memory (WM) is fundamental to many aspects of human life, including learning, speech and text comprehension, prospection and future planning, and explicit ""system 2"" forms of reasoning, as well as overlapping heavily with fluid general intelligence. WM has been intensively studied for many decades, and there is a growing consensus about its nature, its components, and its signature limits. Remarkably, given its central importance in human life, there has been very little comparative investigation of WM abilities across species. Consequently, much remains unknown about the evolution of this important human capacity. Some questions can be tentatively answered from the existing comparative literature. Even studies that were not intended to do so can nonetheless shed light on the WM capacities of nonhuman animals. However, many questions remain."
23751914,Effect of beta and gamma neurofeedback on memory and intelligence in the elderly,S M Staufenbiel,"Recent research showed a correlation between cognitive decline and a decrease of EEG gamma activity. In the present double-blind randomized control study, we investigated whether gamma and beta neurofeedback protocols, that have been shown to modulate performance on cognitive control and memory in young adults, also leads to increased brain activity and cognitive performance in elderly. Twenty older adults either performed eight 30-min gamma neurofeedback session or beta neurofeedback session within a period of 21 days. Cognitive performance was determined before and after the training through an IQ and memory task and we added a subjective well-being questionnaire. Both neurofeedback training protocols resulted in a significant increase of the brain activity within each training session, suggesting that the aging brain is still trainable. However, we found no effects on cognitive performance or transfer of the feedback beyond the trainings. We discuss several possible reasons for the lack of training on rest measurements and cognition and ways to improve the feedback protocols for future studies."
23751886,Maternal factors predicting cognitive and behavioral characteristics of children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders,Philip A May,"Objective: To provide an analysis of multiple predictors of cognitive and behavioral traits for children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Method: Multivariate correlation techniques were used with maternal and child data from epidemiologic studies in a community in South Africa. Data on 561 first-grade children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (PFAS), and not FASD and their mothers were analyzed by grouping 19 maternal variables into categories (physical, demographic, childbearing, and drinking) and used in structural equation models (SEMs) to assess correlates of child intelligence (verbal and nonverbal) and behavior. Results: A first SEM using only 7 maternal alcohol use variables to predict cognitive/behavioral traits was statistically significant (B = 3.10, p < .05) but explained only 17.3% of the variance. The second model incorporated multiple maternal variables and was statistically significant explaining 55.3% of the variance. Significantly correlated with low intelligence and problem behavior were demographic (B = 3.83, p < .05) (low maternal education, low socioeconomic status [SES], and rural residence) and maternal physical characteristics (B = 2.70, p < .05) (short stature, small head circumference, and low weight). Childbearing history and alcohol use composites were not statistically significant in the final complex model and were overpowered by SES and maternal physical traits. Conclusions: Although other analytic techniques have amply demonstrated the negative effects of maternal drinking on intelligence and behavior, this highly controlled analysis of multiple maternal influences reveals that maternal demographics and physical traits make a significant enabling or disabling contribution to child functioning in FASD."
23751304,How could Theory of Mind contribute to the differentiation of social adjustment profiles of children with externalizing behavior disorders and children with intellectual disabilities?,Nathalie Nader-Grosbois,"This study compared Theory of Mind (ToM) emotion and belief abilities in 43 children with externalized behavior (EB) disorders presenting low intelligence, 40 children with intellectual disabilities (ID) and 33 typically developing (TD) preschoolers (as a control group), matched for developmental age. The links between their ToM abilities, their level in seven self-regulation strategies as displayed in social problem-solving tasks and their social adjustment profiles (assessed by the Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation, completed by their teachers) were examined. Children with EB presented lower comprehension of causes of emotions and lower self-regulation of joint attention and of attention than children with ID and TD children. In comparison with TD children, lower social adjustment was observed in nearly all dimensions of profiles in both atypical groups. Specifically, children with EB were significantly angrier than children with ID. Although variable patterns of positive correlations were obtained in atypical groups between self-regulation strategies and ToM abilities, the most numerous positive links were obtained in the group with EB. Regression analyses showed that developmental age predicted ToM abilities and certain dimensions of social adjustment profiles in atypical groups. In the ID group, ToM emotions predicted general adaptation, affective adaptation, interactions with peers and with adults and low internalizing problems. In the EB group, general adaptation was predicted by ToM emotions and self-regulation, interactions with peers by ToM beliefs, and a low level of externalizing problems by ToM emotions. Some implications for intervention and perspectives for research are suggested."
23751295,Association between executive/attentional functions and caries in children with cerebral palsy,M Dourado,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the existence of an association between attention/executive functions and the development of dental caries in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). Seventy-six children with CP were selected from a physical rehabilitation center and a school serving children with disabilities. The control group was made up of 89 children without neurological impairment. Socioeconomic status, presence of teeth with cavities due to caries, degree of motor impairment and intellectual, executive and attentional functions were assessed. Mean age of participants was 8.9 years (SD=3.56). The CP group had a significantly lower performance (p<0.05, Mann-Whitney test) on the intelligence, attentional function and executive function tests in comparison to the control group. Controlling for the clinical diagnosis (CP or control group), motor impairment and intellectual function, the significant explanatory variables for the presence of teeth with cavities were performance on the Complex Rey figure test (OR=0.941) and the Digit Span subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children in backward order (OR=0.581). After controlling for intellectual function, clinical diagnosis and motor impairment, deficits in executive and attentional functions increased the odds of developing dental caries in children with cerebral palsy."
23751010,Learning what to learn: the effects of task experience on strategy shifts in the allocation of study time,Robert Ariel,"Learners typically allocate more resources to learning items that are higher in value than they do to items lower in value. For instance, when items vary in point value for learning, participants allocate more study time to the higher point items than they do to the lower point items. The current experiments extend this research to a context where the value of items is not explicitly labeled by evaluating whether learners' study decisions are sensitive to statistical regularities in the testing environment that signal which items are valuable to learn. In 4 experiments, participants studied English-English and Swahili-English paired associates across 4 study-test trials. On each trial, they were tested on only 1 type of item (e.g., only Swahili-English pairs), and, hence, only 1 type of item was valuable for performance. Some participants were cued to which information was valuable, and other participants had to learn from task experience. Experiment 2 examined the effect of performance incentives on study decisions, and Experiment 3 examined how the organization of the task environment influences learners' decisions. Finally, Experiment 4 examined the role of working memory span, fluid intelligence, and need for cognition on decisions. Findings indicated that some people can learn from task experience which items are important to study. However, many learners fail to do so (in particular, learners with low working memory spans); as a consequence, they dysregulate their study by allocating time to items that are not valuable to performance."
23750810,Perceived emotional intelligence in nursing: psychometric properties of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale,Amor Aradilla-Herrero,"Aims and objectives: To examine the psychometric properties of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale in the nursing context and to determine the relationships between emotional intelligence, self-esteem, alexithymia and death anxiety. Background: The Trait Meta-Mood Scale is one of the most widely used self-report measures for assessing perceived emotional intelligence. However, in the nursing context, no extensive analysis has been conducted to examine its psychometric properties. Design: Cross-sectional and observational study. Methods: A total of 1417 subjects participated in the study (1208 nursing students and 209 hospital nurses). The Trait Meta-Mood Scale, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Death Anxiety Inventory were all applied to half of the sample (n = 707). A confirmatory factor analysis was carried out, and statistical analyses examined the internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale, as well as its relationship with relevant variables. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the three dimensions of the original scale (Attention, Clarity and Repair). The instrument showed adequate internal consistency and temporal stability. Correlational results indicated that nurses with high scores on emotional Attention experience more death anxiety, report greater difficulties identifying feelings and have less self-esteem. By contrast, nurses with high levels of emotional Clarity and Repair showed less death anxiety and higher levels of self-esteem. Conclusions: The Trait Meta-Mood Scale is an effective, valid and reliable tool for measuring perceived emotional intelligence in the nursing context. Training programmes should seek to promote emotional abilities among nurses. Relevance to clinical practice: Use of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale in the nursing context would provide information about nurses' perceived abilities to interpret and manage emotions when interacting with patients."
23750597,Does IQ moderate the relation between psychopathy and juvenile offending?,Ashley S Hampton,"Although evidence indicates that both psychopathy and intelligence independently predict juvenile offending, relations among IQ, psychopathy, and offending are inconsistent. We investigated whether intelligence moderates the relation between psychopathy and both income and aggressive offending concurrently and over time among 1,354 juvenile offenders enrolled in Pathways to Desistance, a prospective study of serious juvenile offenders in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Phoenix, Arizona. Participants were assessed on intelligence, psychopathy, and self-reported offending at their initial interview (age range: 14-18 years old), and at 36 and 84 months later. Results indicate that intelligence moderates the concurrent relation between both income and aggressive offending and total psychopathy, as well as scores on Factor 1 (interpersonal/affective) and Factor 2 (social deviance); the 36-month prospective relation between all aspects of psychopathy and income offending; and the 84-month prospective relation between Factor 2 psychopathy and aggressive offending. As expected, higher levels of psychopathy are associated with higher levels of offending, but the highest levels of offending are evinced among youth with relatively higher levels of psychopathy and relatively higher IQ."
23748532,"Understanding unconscious intelligence and intuition: ""blink"" and beyond",Lois Isenman,"The importance of unconscious intelligence and intuition is increasingly acknowledged by the scientific community. This essay examines and assesses the varied views on the topic presented in three books that bridge the scientific world and reading public: Blink by Malcolm Gladwell (2005), Gut Feelings by Gerd Gigerenzer (2008), and How Doctors Think by Jerome Groopman (2007). The analysis differentiates among kinds of unconscious intelligence and points towards a more complete understanding of the higher cognitive potential of the unconscious mind."
23748169,An intelligent surveillance platform for large metropolitan areas with dense sensor deployment,Jorge Fernández,"This paper presents an intelligent surveillance platform based on the usage of large numbers of inexpensive sensors designed and developed inside the European Eureka Celtic project HuSIMS. With the aim of maximizing the number of deployable units while keeping monetary and resource/bandwidth costs at a minimum, the surveillance platform is based on the usage of inexpensive visual sensors which apply efficient motion detection and tracking algorithms to transform the video signal in a set of motion parameters. In order to automate the analysis of the myriad of data streams generated by the visual sensors, the platform's control center includes an alarm detection engine which comprises three components applying three different Artificial Intelligence strategies in parallel. These strategies are generic, domain-independent approaches which are able to operate in several domains (traffic surveillance, vandalism prevention, perimeter security, etc.). The architecture is completed with a versatile communication network which facilitates data collection from the visual sensors and alarm and video stream distribution towards the emergency teams. The resulting surveillance system is extremely suitable for its deployment in metropolitan areas, smart cities, and large facilities, mainly because cheap visual sensors and autonomous alarm detection facilitate dense sensor network deployments for wide and detailed coverage."
23747746,PPIevo: protein-protein interaction prediction from PSSM based evolutionary information,Javad Zahiri,"Protein-protein interactions regulate a variety of cellular processes. There is a great need for computational methods as a complement to experimental methods with which to predict protein interactions due to the existence of many limitations involved in experimental techniques. Here, we introduce a novel evolutionary based feature extraction algorithm for protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction. The algorithm is called PPIevo and extracts the evolutionary feature from Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) of protein with known sequence. The algorithm does not depend on the protein annotations, and the features are based on the evolutionary history of the proteins. This enables the algorithm to have more power for predicting protein-protein interaction than many sequence based algorithms. Results on the HPRD database show better performance and robustness of the proposed method. They also reveal that the negative dataset selection could lead to an acute performance overestimation which is the principal drawback of the available methods."
23747499,Cerebellar volume is linked to cognitive function in temporal lobe epilepsy: a quantitative MRI study,Sabine Hellwig,"Introduction: Chronic intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is associated with certain comorbidities including cognitive impairment. A less common condition among patients with TLE is intermittent explosive disorder (IED), a specific form of aggressive behavior that has been linked to low intelligence and structural pathology in the amygdala. We aimed to identify other neuroanatomical substrates of both cognitive dysfunction and IED in patients with TLE, with special focus on the cerebellum, a brain region known to participate in functional networks involved in neuropsychological and affective processes. Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging-based volumetric data from 60 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (36 with and 24 without IED) were evaluated. Cerebellar, hippocampal, and total brain volumes were processed separately. In a total of 50 patients, the relationship between volumetric measurements and clinical and neuropsychological data (full-scale, verbal, and performance intelligence quotients) was analyzed. Results: Intermittent explosive disorder in patients with TLE was not significantly linked to any of the regional volumes analyzed. However, cognitive performance showed a significant association both with total brain volume and cerebellar volume measurements, whereby the left cerebellar volume showed the strongest association. A deviation from normal cerebellar volumes was related to lower intelligence. Of note, left cerebellar volume was influenced by age and duration of epilepsy. Hippocampal volumes had a minor influence on cognitive parameters. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that cerebellar volume is not linked to IED in patients with TLE but is significantly associated with cognitive dysfunction. Our findings support recent hypotheses proposing that the cerebellum has a relevant functional topography."
23747090,The influence of medical students' and doctors' attachment style and emotional intelligence on their patient-provider communication,Mary Gemma Cherry,"Objective: Attachment style and emotional intelligence (EI) have been highlighted as potential factors influencing the variation in medical students' and doctors' patient-provider communication (PPC), particularly in relation to emotive issues. The objective of this review is to systematically review and synthesise the published literature relating to the influence of medical students' and/or doctors' attachment style and EI on their PPC. Methods: Electronic and hand searches were conducted to identify all published literature relating to the aim of the review. Data were narratively synthesised. Results: 1597 studies were identified. 14 were included in the review, of which 5 assessed the influence of attachment style and 9 assessed the influence of EI on PPC. No studies assessed the impact of both attachment style and EI on PPC. Conclusion: Whilst tentative links were found between both PPC and both attachment style and EI, heterogeneity in study design, predictor variables and outcome measures made drawing conclusions difficult. Practice implications: More research is needed to assess the influence of both attachment style and EI on PPC."
23746735,An ant colony optimization based algorithm for identifying gene regulatory elements,Wei Liu,"It is one of the most important tasks in bioinformatics to identify the regulatory elements in gene sequences. Most of the existing algorithms for identifying regulatory elements are inclined to converge into a local optimum, and have high time complexity. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a meta-heuristic method based on swarm intelligence and is derived from a model inspired by the collective foraging behavior of real ants. Taking advantage of the ACO in traits such as self-organization and robustness, this paper designs and implements an ACO based algorithm named ACRI (ant-colony-regulatory-identification) for identifying all possible binding sites of transcription factor from the upstream of co-expressed genes. To accelerate the ants' searching process, a strategy of local optimization is presented to adjust the ants' start positions on the searched sequences. By exploiting the powerful optimization ability of ACO, the algorithm ACRI can not only improve precision of the results, but also achieve a very high speed. Experimental results on real world datasets show that ACRI can outperform other traditional algorithms in the respects of speed and quality of solutions."
23745760,Assessing the accuracy of the WISC-IV seven-subtest short form and the child and adolescent intellectual disability screening questionnaire in identifying intellectual disability in children,Karen McKenzie,"Little research has been conducted into the accuracy of abbreviated assessments in identifying children and young people with an intellectual disability (ID). The present study compared two such methods in a clinical population of individuals with (n = 106) and without (n = 170) ID: a 7-subtest short form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales for Children--fourth edition (WISC-IV) proposed by Crawford and colleagues and the Child and Adolescent Intellectual Disability Screening Questionnaire (CAIDS-Q). Both the CAIDS-Q and the WISC-IV short form had high and comparable levels of predicting group classification (88% and 91% correct classification, respectively). Both methods would appear to offer clinicians and researchers an efficient and accurate means of identifying those who are likely to have ID. The WISC-IV short form was slightly more accurate, but the CAIDS-Q may offer the advantages of being shorter to administer and having no requirement for the user to have a particular qualification or training."
23745736,Why is working memory related to intelligence? Different contributions from storage and processing,Cai-Ping Dang,"Domain-specific contributions of working memory (WM), short-term memory (STM), and executive functioning (EF) to individual differences in intelligence were analysed using a latent variable approach. A sample of 345 participants completed a battery of 24 tests tapping the constructs of interests as comprehensively as possible. Visuospatial and verbal STM and WM tasks were administered along with three subcomponents of EF, namely inhibition, planning, and shifting. Intelligence was assessed by non-verbal/abstract/fluid intelligence (Gf) and verbal/crystallised intelligence (Gc) standardised tests. Structural equation modelling results show that EF is the main predictor of Gf, whereas verbal STM is the main predictor of Gc. Storage and processing providing different contributions to the prediction of Gf and Gc supports the view that both short-term storage and executive functioning account for the relationship between WM and intelligence. This main conclusion stresses the importance of acknowledging core cognitive constructs as being hierarchical systems with general and domain-specific mechanisms."
23745391,An object-oriented intelligent engineering design approach for lake pollution control],Rui Zou,"Regarding the shortage and deficiency of traditional lake pollution control engineering techniques, a new lake pollution control engineering approach was proposed in this study, based on object-oriented intelligent design (OOID) from the perspective of intelligence. It can provide a new methodology and framework for effectively controlling lake pollution and improving water quality. The differences between the traditional engineering techniques and the OOID approach were compared. The key points for OOID were described as object perspective, cause and effect foundation, set points into surface, and temporal and spatial optimization. The blue algae control in lake was taken as an example in this study. The effect of algae control and water quality improvement were analyzed in details from the perspective of object-oriented intelligent design based on two engineering techniques (vertical hydrodynamic mixer and pumping algaecide recharge). The modeling results showed that the traditional engineering design paradigm cannot provide scientific and effective guidance for engineering design and decision-making regarding lake pollution. Intelligent design approach is based on the object perspective and quantitative causal analysis in this case. This approach identified that the efficiency of mixers was much higher than pumps in achieving the goal of low to moderate water quality improvement. However, when the objective of water quality exceeded a certain value (such as the control objective of peak Chla concentration exceeded 100 microg x L(-1) in this experimental water), the mixer cannot achieve this goal. The pump technique can achieve the goal but with higher cost. The efficiency of combining the two techniques was higher than using one of the two techniques alone. Moreover, the quantitative scale control of the two engineering techniques has a significant impact on the actual project benefits and costs."
23744874,General cognitive ability and the psychological refractory period: individual differences in the mind's bottleneck,James J Lee,"Identifying the precise locus of general cognitive ability (g) in the flow of information between perception and action is an important goal of differential psychology. To localize the negative correlation between g and reaction time to a specific processing stage, we administered a speeded number-comparison task to two groups differing in average g. The participants had to respond to two stimuli in each trial, which produced the well-known slowing of the second reaction time known as the psychological refractory period. The difference in the second reaction time favoring the high-g group doubled as the stimulus onsets became very close together. This finding affirms that the faster reaction times of higher-g individuals reflect an advantage exclusively in the serial bottleneck of central processing and not in the parallel peripheral stages."
23744583,Long-term decline in intelligence among adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with cranial radiation,Kevin R Krull,"Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with cranial radiation therapy (CRT) are at risk for cognitive impairment, although whether impairment progresses with age into adulthood is unknown. We report change in intelligence for 102 adult survivors of childhood ALL (age range, 26.6-54.7 years) during a median interval of 28.5 years. Survivors demonstrated lower Performance intelligence (mean, 95.3; standard deviation, 16.5; P = .005) but not Verbal IQ (mean, 97.4; standard deviation, 15.44; P = .09) at initial testing. Verbal intelligence declined an average of 10.3 points (P < .0001) during the follow-up interval with no decline in Performance intelligence. Decline was associated with current attention problems (P = .002) but not gender, CRT dose, age at CRT exposure, or years between testing. Results suggest long-term survivors of childhood ALL treated with CRT are at risk for progressive decline in verbal intellect, which may be driven by attention deficits. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as no. NCT00760656."
23743214,"Patient behavior and the benefits of artificial intelligence: the perils of ""dangerous"" literacy and illusory patient empowerment",Peter J Schulz,"Objective: Artificial intelligence can provide important support of patient health. However, limits to realized benefits can arise as patients assume an active role in their health decisions. Methods: Distinguishing the concepts of health literacy and patient empowerment, we analyze conditions that bias patient use of the Internet and limit access to and impact of artificial intelligence. Results: Improving health literacy in the face of the Internet requires significant guidance. Patients must be directed toward the appropriate tools and also provided with key background knowledge enabling them to use the tools and capitalize on the artificial intelligence technology. Conclusion: Benefits of tools employing artificial intelligence to promote health cannot be realized without recognizing and addressing the patients' desires, expectations, and limitations that impact their Internet behavior. In order to benefit from artificial intelligence, patients need a substantial level of background knowledge and skill in information use-i.e., health literacy. Practice implications: It is critical that health professionals respond to patient search for information on the Internet, first by guiding their search to relevant, authoritative, and responsive sources, and second by educating patients about how to interpret the information they are likely to encounter."
23743135,Reduced but broader prefrontal activity in patients with schizophrenia during n-back working memory tasks: a multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy study,Shinsuke Koike,"Background: Caudal regions of the prefrontal cortex, including the dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventrolateral (VLPFC) prefrontal cortex, are involved in essential cognitive functions such as working memory. In contrast, more rostral regions, such as the frontopolar cortex (FpC), have integrative functions among cognitive functions and thereby contribute crucially to real-world social activity. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown patients with schizophrenia had different DLPFC activity pattern in response to cognitive load changes compared to healthy controls; however, the spatial relationship between the caudal and rostral prefrontal activation has not been evaluated under less-constrained conditions. Method: Twenty-six patients with schizophrenia and 26 age-, sex-, and premorbid-intelligence-matched healthy controls participated in this study. Hemodynamic changes during n-back working memory tasks with different cognitive loads were measured using multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Results: Healthy controls showed significant task-related activity in the bilateral VLPFC and significant task-related decreased activity in the DLPFC, with greater signal changes when the task required more cognitive load. In contrast, patients with schizophrenia showed activation in the more rostral regions, including bilateral DLPFC and FpC. Neither decreased activity nor greater activation in proportion to elevated cognitive load occurred. Conclusions: This multi-channel NIRS study demonstrated that activation intensity did not increase in patients with schizophrenia associated with cognitive load changes, suggesting hypo-frontality as cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. On the other hand, patients had broader prefrontal activity in areas such as the bilateral DLPFC and FpC regions, thus suggesting a hyper-frontality compensatory response."
23742716,"Work readiness of graduate nurses and the impact on job satisfaction, work engagement and intention to remain",Arlene Walker,"Background and aim: Graduate work readiness is a relatively new construct that can predict graduate potential. Its impact on graduate work outcomes however, is unknown. The current study aimed to explore the relationships between work readiness and a number of work outcomes (job satisfaction, work engagement, and intention to remain). Design and participants: A survey design was used. A sample of 96 graduate nurses from two regional hospitals in Victoria, Australia participated in this study. Method: Data were collected using quantitative surveys Results: Three of the four work readiness dimensions (organisational acumen, clinical competence and social intelligence) were found to predict job satisfaction and work engagement. Moreover, both job satisfaction and work engagement were found to mediate the relationship between organisational acumen and intention to remain. The findings indicate that dimensions of work readiness uniquely predict work outcomes. Conclusion: Findings support prior research, which suggests that graduate work readiness is a multidimensional construct comprising skills and attributes beyond discipline-specific competence."
23742245,Expressing one's feelings and listening to others increases emotional intelligence: a pilot study of Asian medical students,Keiko Abe,"Background: There has been considerable interest in Emotional Intelligence (EI) in undergraduate medical education, with respect to student selection and admissions, health and well-being and academic performance. EI is a significant component of the physician-patient relationship. The emotional well-being of the physician is, therefore, a significant component in patient care. The aim is to examine the measurement of TEIQue-SF in Asian medical students and to explore how the practice of listening to the feelings of others and expressing one's own feelings influences an individual's EI, set in the context of the emotional well-being of a medical practitioner. Methods: A group of 183 international undergraduate medical students attended a half-day workshop (WS) about mental-health and well-being. They completed a self-reported measure of EI on three occasions, pre- and post-workshop, and a 1-year follow-up. Result: The reliability of TEIQue-SF was high and the reliabilities of its four factors were acceptable. There were strong correlations between the TEIQue-SF and personality traits. A paired t-test indicated significant positive changes after the WS for all students (n=181, p=.014), male students (n=78, p=.015) and non-Japanese students (n=112, p=.007), but a repeated measures analysis showed that one year post-workshop there were significant positive changes for all students (n=55, p=.034), female students (n=31, p=.007), especially Japanese female students (n=13, p=.023). Moreover, 80% of the students reported that they were more attentive listeners, and 60% agreed that they were more confident in dealing with emotional issues, both within themselves and in others, as a result of the workshop. Conclusion: This study found the measurement of TEIQue-SF is appropriate and reliable to use for Asian medical students. The mental health workshop was helpful to develop medical students' EI but showed different results for gender and nationality. The immediate impact on the emotional awareness of individuals was particularly significant for male students and the non-Japanese group. The impact over the long term was notable for the significant increase in EI for females and Japanese. Japanese female students were more conscious about emotionality. Emotion-driven communication exercises might strongly influence the development of students' EI over a year."
23740280,"Neurodevelopmental, educational and behavioral outcome at 8 years after neonatal ECMO: a nationwide multicenter study",Marlous J Madderom,"Purpose: Reporting neurodevelopmental outcome of 8-year-old children treated with neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Methods: In a follow-up study in 135 8-year-old children who received neonatal ECMO between 1996 and 2001 we assessed intelligence (Revised Amsterdam Intelligence Test), concentration (Bourdon-Vos test), eye-hand coordination (Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration) and behavior (Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher Report Form). Results: Intelligence fell within normal range (mean IQ 99.9, SD 17.7, n = 125) with 91 % of the children following regular education. Significantly more children attended special education (9 %) or received extra support in regular education (39 %) compared with normative data. Slower working speed (χ(2) = 132.36, p < 0.001) and less accuracy (χ(2) = 12.90, p < 0.001) were found on the Bourdon-Vos test (n = 123) compared with normative data. Eye-hand coordination fell within the normal range (mean 97.6, SD 14.3, n = 126); children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia scored lowest but still normally (mean 91.0, SD 16.4, n = 28). Mothers (n = 117) indicated more somatic and attention behavior problems; teachers (n = 115) indicated more somatic, social, thought, aggression and total problems compared with normative data. Mothers indicated more somatic problems than teachers (p = 0.003); teachers reported more attention problems than mothers (p = 0.036; n = 111). Conclusions: Eight-year-old children treated with neonatal ECMO fall in the normal range of intelligence with problems with concentration and behavior. Long-term follow-up for children treated with neonatal ECMO should focus on early detection of (subtle) learning deficits."
23739355,Case-based reasoning in Intelligent Health Decision Support Systems,Carolina González,"Decision-making is a crucial task for decision makers in healthcare, especially because decisions have to be made quickly, accurately and under uncertainty. Taking into account the importance of providing quality decisions, offering assistance in this complex process has been one of the main challenges of Artificial Intelligence throughout history. Decision Support Systems (DSS) have gained popularity in the medical field for their efficacy to assist decision-making. In this sense, many DSS have been developed, but only few of them consider processing and analysis of information contained in electronic health records, in order to identify individual or population health risk factors. This paper deals with Intelligent Decision Support Systems that are integrated into Electronic Health Records Systems (EHRS) or Public Health Information Systems (PHIS). It provides comprehensive support for a wide range of decisions with the purpose of improving quality of care delivered to patients or public health planning, respectively."
23737086,Tyrosine supplementation for phenylketonuria,Diana Webster,"Background: Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease for which the main treatment is the dietary restriction of the amino acid phenylalanine. The diet has to be initiated in the neonatal period to prevent or reduce mental handicap. However, the diet is very restrictive and unpalatable and can be difficult to follow. A deficiency of the amino acid tyrosine has been suggested as a cause of some of the neuropsychological problems exhibited in phenylketonuria. Therefore, this review aims to assess the efficacy of tyrosine supplementation for phenylketonuria. Objectives: To assess the effects of tyrosine supplementation alongside or instead of a phenylalanine-restricted diet for people with phenylketonuria, who commenced on diet at diagnosis and either continued on the diet or relaxed the diet later in life. To assess the evidence that tyrosine supplementation alongside, or instead of a phenylalanine-restricted diet improves intelligence, neuropsychological performance, growth and nutritional status, mortality rate and quality of life. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional studies were identified from handsearches of the Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (from inception in 1978 to 1998). The manufacturers of prescribable dietary products used in the treatment of phenylketonuria were also contacted for further references.Date of the most recent search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 28 June 2012. Selection criteria: All randomised or quasi-randomised trials investigating the use of tyrosine supplementation versus placebo in people with phenylketonuria in addition to, or instead of, a phenylalanine-restricted diet. People treated for maternal phenylketonuria were excluded. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed the trial eligibility, methodological quality and extracted the data. Main results: Six trials were found, of which three trials reporting the results of a total of 56 participants, were suitable for inclusion in the review. The blood tyrosine concentrations were significantly higher in the participants receiving tyrosine supplements than those in the placebo group, mean difference 23.46 (95% confidence interval 12.87 to 34.05). No significant differences were found between any of the other outcomes measured. Authors' conclusions: From the available evidence no recommendations can be made about whether tyrosine supplementation should be introduced into routine clinical practice. Further randomised controlled studies are required to provide more evidence."
23735165,Intellectual function evaluation of first generation immigrant children with sickle cell disease: the role of language and sociodemographic factors,Maria Montanaro,"Background: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disease worldwide. Neurological events are among the most worrisome clinical complications of SCD and are frequently accompanied by cognitive impairment. Intellectual function in SCD may vary according to genetic and environmental factors. Immigrant children with SCD are increasing at a global level and display specific health care needs. The aim of our multicenter study was to describe the intellectual function of first generation African immigrants with SCD and the influence of sociodemographic factors on its characteristics. Methods: The Wechsler Intelligence Scales were administered to evaluate broad intellectual functions in children with SCD and in age-matched healthy siblings. Patients' clinical, socio-demographic, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Angiography (MRA) data were correlated to intellectual function scores. Results: 68 children, mean age 8.95 years were evaluated. 72% spoke three languages, 21% two. FSIQ was <75 in 25% of the children. Mean VIQ was lower than PIQ in 75%. Mean verbal subtest scores were lower than performance scores. Female gender, number of languages spoken at home and mother's employment were associated with single subtest performances (p < 0.05). MRA was abnormal in 73.4% and MRI in 35.9%. No significant correlation was established between silent lesions and intellectual function, even if patients with lesions performed worse. Fifteen siblings performed better than patients on cognitive domains, including language (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Immigrant bilingual children with SCD seem to display a rate of cognitive impairment similar to their monolingual counterparts but a more pronounced and precocious onset of language difficulties. Adjunctive tests need to be considered in this group of patients to better define their specific deficits."
23734241,Impact of low blood lead concentrations on IQ and school performance in Chinese children,Jianghong Liu,"Objectives: Examine the relationships between blood lead concentrations and children's intelligence quotient (IQ) and school performance. Participants and methods: Participants were 1341 children (738 boys and 603 girls) from Jintan, China. Blood lead concentrations were measured when children were 3-5 years old. IQ was assessed using the Chinese version and norms of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Revised when children were 6 years old. School performance was assessed by standardized city tests on 3 major subjects (Chinese, Math, and English [as a foreign language]) when children were age 8-10 years. Results: Mean blood lead concentration was 6.43 µg/dL (SD = 2.64). For blood lead concentrations, 7.8% of children (n = 105) had ≥10.0 µg/dL, 13.8% (n = 185) had 8.0 to <10.0 µg/dL, and 78.4% (n = 1051) had <8.0 µg/dL. Compared to children with blood lead concentrations <8 µg/dL, those with blood lead concentrations ≥8 µg/dL scored 2-3 points lower in IQ and 5-6 points lower in school tests. There were no significant differences in IQ or school tests between children with blood lead concentrations groups 8-10 and ≥10 µg/dL. After adjustment for child and family characteristics and IQ, blood lead concentrations ≥10 µg/dL vs <8 µg/dL at ages 3-5 years was associated with reduced scores on school tests at age 8-10 years (Chinese, β = -3.54, 95%CI = -6.46, -0.63; Math, β = -4.63, 95%CI = -7.86, -1.40; English, β = -4.66, 95%CI = -8.09, -1.23). IQ partially mediated the relationship between elevated blood lead concentrations and later school performance. Conclusions: Findings support that blood lead concentrations in early childhood, even <10 µg/dL, have a long-term negative impact on cognitive development. The association between blood lead concentrations 8-10 µg/dL and cognitive development needs further study in Chinese children and children from other developing countries."
23734227,Extracting physician group intelligence from electronic health records to support evidence based medicine,Griffin M Weber,"Evidence-based medicine employs expert opinion and clinical data to inform clinical decision making. The objective of this study is to determine whether it is possible to complement these sources of evidence with information about physician ""group intelligence"" that exists in electronic health records. Specifically, we measured laboratory test ""repeat intervals"", defined as the amount of time it takes for a physician to repeat a test that was previously ordered for the same patient. Our assumption is that while the result of a test is a direct measure of one marker of a patient's health, the physician's decision to order the test is based on multiple factors including past experience, available treatment options, and information about the patient that might not be coded in the electronic health record. By examining repeat intervals in aggregate over large numbers of patients, we show that it is possible to 1) determine what laboratory test results physicians consider ""normal"", 2) identify subpopulations of patients that deviate from the norm, and 3) identify situations where laboratory tests are over-ordered. We used laboratory tests as just one example of how physician group intelligence can be used to support evidence based medicine in a way that is automated and continually updated."
23732878,Childhood cognitive ability accounts for associations between cognitive ability and brain cortical thickness in old age,S Karama,"Associations between brain cortical tissue volume and cognitive function in old age are frequently interpreted as suggesting that preservation of cortical tissue is the foundation of successful cognitive aging. However, this association could also, in part, reflect a lifelong association between cognitive ability and cortical tissue. We analyzed data on 588 subjects from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 who had intelligence quotient (IQ) scores from the same cognitive test available at both 11 and 70 years of age as well as high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging data obtained at approximately 73 years of age. Cortical thickness was estimated at 81 924 sampling points across the cortex for each subject using an automated pipeline. Multiple regression was used to assess associations between cortical thickness and the IQ measures at 11 and 70 years. Childhood IQ accounted for more than two-third of the association between IQ at 70 years and cortical thickness measured at age 73 years. This warns against ascribing a causal interpretation to the association between cognitive ability and cortical tissue in old age based on assumptions about, and exclusive reference to, the aging process and any associated disease. Without early-life measures of cognitive ability, it would have been tempting to conclude that preservation of cortical thickness in old age is a foundation for successful cognitive aging when, instead, it is a lifelong association. This being said, results should not be construed as meaning that all studies on aging require direct measures of childhood IQ, but as suggesting that proxy measures of prior cognitive function can be useful to take into consideration."
23732512,"Effect modification by transferrin C2 polymorphism on lead exposure, hemoglobin levels, and IQ",Ananya Roy,"Background: Iron deficiency and lead exposure remain significant public health issues in many parts of the world and are both independently associated with neurocognitive deficits. Polymorphisms in iron transport pathways have been shown to modify the absorption and toxicity of lead. Objective: We hypothesized that the transferrin (TF) C2 polymorphism modifies the effects of lead and hemoglobin on intelligence. Methods: Children aged 3-7 years (N=708) were enrolled from 12 primary schools in Chennai, India. The Binet-Kamath Scale of Intelligence were administered to ascertain intelligence quotient (IQ). Venous blood was analyzed for lead and hemoglobin levels. Genotyping for the TF C2 polymorphism (rs1049296) was carried out using a MassARRAY iPLEXTM platform. Stratified analyses and interaction models, using generalized estimating equations, were examined to explore interactions between lead, hemoglobin, and TF C2 categories. Results: A one-unit increase in log blood lead and 1g/dl higher hemoglobin was associated with -77 (95% CI: -136, -18) and 17 (95% CI 14, 21) IQ points, respectively, among children carrying the C2 variant. In comparison, among children who had the homozygous wildtype allele, the same increment of lead and hemoglobin were associated with -21(95% CI: -65, 24) and 28 (95% CI: 15, 40) IQ points, respectively. There was a significant interaction between lead (p=0.04) and hemoglobin (p=0.07) with the C2 variant. Conclusion: Children who carry the TF C2 variant may be more susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of lead exposure and less protected by higher levels of hemoglobin."
23732274,AuthorReward: increasing community curation in biological knowledge wikis through automated authorship quantification,Lin Dai,"Summary: Community curation-harnessing community intelligence in knowledge curation, bears great promise in dealing with the flood of biological knowledge. To exploit the full potential of the scientific community for knowledge curation, multiple biological wikis (bio-wikis) have been built to date. However, none of them have achieved a substantial impact on knowledge curation. One of the major limitations in bio-wikis is insufficient community participation, which is intrinsically because of lack of explicit authorship and thus no credit for community curation. To increase community curation in bio-wikis, here we develop AuthorReward, an extension to MediaWiki, to reward community-curated efforts in knowledge curation. AuthorReward quantifies researchers' contributions by properly factoring both edit quantity and quality and yields automated explicit authorship according to their quantitative contributions. AuthorReward provides bio-wikis with an authorship metric, helpful to increase community participation in bio-wikis and to achieve community curation of massive biological knowledge.

23732046,Do dietary patterns influence cognitive function in old age?,Janie Corley,"Background: Evidence from observational studies to date suggests that healthy dietary patterns are associated with better cognitive performance in later life. We examined the extent to which childhood intelligence quotient (IQ) and socioeconomic status account for this association. Methods: Analyses were carried out on 882 participants in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 Study. Four dietary patterns were extracted using principal components analysis of a food frequency questionnaire, namely ""Mediterranean-style,"" ""health aware,"" ""traditional,"" and ""sweet foods."" Cognitive function was assessed at the age of 70 years, including general (g) cognitive ability, processing speed, memory, and verbal ability. Results: Before adjustment for childhood IQ and socioeconomic status, the ""Mediterranean-style"" dietary pattern was associated with significantly better cognitive performance (effect size as partial eta-square (ηp(2)) range = 0.005 to 0.055), and the ""traditional"" dietary pattern was associated with poorer performance on all cognitive domains measured in old age (ηp(2) = 0.009 to 0.103). After adjustment for childhood IQ (measured at the age of 11 years) and socioeconomic status, statistical significance was lost for most associations, with the exception of verbal ability and the ""Mediterranean-style"" pattern (National Adult Reading Test (NART) ηp(2) = 0.006 and Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) ηp(2) = 0.013), and the ""traditional"" pattern (NART ηp(2) = 0.035 and WTAR ηp(2) = 0.027). Conclusions: Our results suggest a pattern of reverse causation or confounding; a higher childhood cognitive ability (and adult socioeconomic status) predicts adherence to a ""healthy"" diet and better cognitive performance in old age. Our models show no direct link between diet and cognitive performance in old age; instead they are related via the lifelong-stable trait of intelligence."
23731897,Validation of a functional remission threshold for the Functional Remission of General Schizophrenia (FROGS) scale,Laurent Boyer,"Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a functional remission threshold for the Functional Remission Of General Schizophrenia (FROGS) scale, and test its validity regarding clinical and quality of life outcomes. Design: Cross-sectional study. Inclusion criteria: Schizophrenia according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Data collection: Functioning was assessed using the FROGS and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scales; psychotic symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; memory, attention, and executive functions were assessed using the California Verbal Learning Test, the D2 attention task, the Stroop color-word test, the verbal fluency test, the Trail Making Test A and B and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale; and quality of life using the schizophrenia quality of life (S-QoL 18) scale. Analysis: A logistic regression analysis including the different dimensions of the FROGS was used to create a composite score to classify patients into remitted and non-remitted according a gold standard (cut-off: GAF>= 61). Receiver operating characteristics analyses were then performed to determine the area under the curve (AUC). Results: Of 137 patients enrolled, 26 were functionally remitted and 111 were not remitted according to GAF score. The AUC for the combination of the FROGS's dimensions to detect functional remission was 0.903 (p<0.001). Sensitivity and specificity for the combination of the FROGS dimensions using the Youden index were 88.5 [69.8; 97.6] and 81.1 [72.5; 87.9], respectively. Validity of this combination was satisfactory. Patients in functional remission had a lower severity of the disease, especially for PANSS negative (p<0.001) and general psychopathology (p<0.001) symptoms. Only two cognitive functions (i.e. fluency and episodic memory) were improved in remitted patients. Higher quality of life levels were globally associated with better functioning. Conclusions: These findings provide for first accurate FROGS thresholds to detect functional remission in schizophrenia."
23727455,Intellectual functioning and multi-dimensional attentional processes in long-term survivors of a central nervous system related pediatric malignancy,Robert W Butler,"Aims: Central nervous system (CNS) malignancies and/or their treatment in pediatric cancer survivors are known to be associated with deficits in neuropsychological functions. We report findings from a nation-wide study of childhood cancer survivors to investigate intelligence and attention/concentration from a multi-dimensional perspective in a diverse sample from this population. Main methods: Four hundred forty-four pediatric cancer survivors between 6 and 17 years of age, who had suffered CNS involvement associated with their malignancy, were evaluated. All patients completed a measure of general intelligence. Attention was measured by a continuous performance test (CPT) and by parental report using a standardized psychological inventory. Key findings: Social economic status (SES) was a significant predictor of intellectual functioning and scores on independent measures of attention. After controlling for SES, cranial radiation therapy (CRT) was strongly predictive of impairments in intellectual functioning. Patients who had completed a transplant procedure did not have significant impairments in intellectual functioning when compared to other participants. CPT performance was most clearly influenced by a younger age at diagnosis and the presence of a supratentorial brain tumor. Reaction time was lower in patients who had received CRT. Gender did not correlate with CPT performance, but caregiver reports of deficits in attentional functioning were more prevalent in girls compared to boys. Significance: These findings are important given the large, representative sample and multi-dimensional assessment of attentional functioning. The presence of a very strong SES effect on all dependent variables must be addressed in studies of this nature."
23727321,Partial least squares correlation of multivariate cognitive abilities and local brain structure in children and adolescents,G Ziegler,"Intelligent behavior is not a one-dimensional phenomenon. Individual differences in human cognitive abilities might be therefore described by a 'cognitive manifold' of intercorrelated tests from partially independent domains of general intelligence and executive functions. However, the relationship between these individual differences and brain morphology is not yet fully understood. Here we take a multivariate approach to analyzing covariations across individuals in two feature spaces: the low-dimensional space of cognitive ability subtests and the high-dimensional space of local gray matter volume obtained from voxel-based morphometry. By exploiting a partial least squares correlation framework in a large sample of 286 healthy children and adolescents, we identify directions of maximum covariance between both spaces in terms of latent variable modeling. We obtain an orthogonal set of latent variables representing commonalities in the brain-behavior system, which emphasize specific neuronal networks involved in cognitive ability differences. We further explore the early lifespan maturation of the covariance between cognitive abilities and local gray matter volume. The dominant latent variable revealed positive weights across widespread gray matter regions (in the brain domain) and the strongest weights for parents' ratings of children's executive function (in the cognitive domain). The obtained latent variables for brain and cognitive abilities exhibited moderate correlations of 0.46-0.6. Moreover, the multivariate modeling revealed indications for a heterochronic formation of the association as a process of brain maturation across different age groups."
23726747,Adding coping-related strategies to biomedical argumentation in computer-generated genetic counseling patient letters,Nancy L Green,"Objective: Previously an experimental computer system was developed to automatically produce first drafts of genetic counseling patient letters containing biomedical evidence-based arguments. However, letters written by genetic counselors also employ strategies to help clients cope. The objectives of this research were to discover methods for addition of coping-related strategies to the drafts and to explore their efficacy. Methods: Using an argumentation-based approach, the system design was modified to add coping-related strategies used by actual genetic counselors. An evaluation of computer-produced drafts was performed comparing those containing only biomedical arguments to those with coping strategies added to biomedical arguments. Results: The evaluation mainly found no significant impact of adding coping strategies. Conclusion: The main contribution of this work was to show how coping-related strategies can be produced by an artificial intelligence approach within an argumentation-based theoretical framework. A possible future application would be to improve computer-drafted genetic counseling patient letters. Practice implications: Computer-assisted drafting of letters has potential to aid in the practice of genetic counseling. Further research is needed to demonstrate the efficacy of adding coping strategies to computer-produced drafts."
23726219,Using design science and artificial intelligence to improve health communication: ChronologyMD case example,Linda Neuhauser,"Objective: This paper describes how design science theory and methods and use of artificial intelligence (AI) components can improve the effectiveness of health communication. Methods: We identified key weaknesses of traditional health communication and features of more successful eHealth/AI communication. We examined characteristics of the design science paradigm and the value of its user-centered methods to develop eHealth/AI communication. We analyzed a case example of the participatory design of AI components in the ChronologyMD project intended to improve management of Crohn's disease. Results: eHealth/AI communication created with user-centered design shows improved relevance to users' needs for personalized, timely and interactive communication and is associated with better health outcomes than traditional approaches. Participatory design was essential to develop ChronologyMD system architecture and software applications that benefitted patients. Conclusion: AI components can greatly improve eHealth/AI communication, if designed with the intended audiences. Design science theory and its iterative, participatory methods linked with traditional health communication theory and methods can create effective AI health communication. Practice implications: eHealth/AI communication researchers, developers and practitioners can benefit from a holistic approach that draws from theory and methods in both design sciences and also human and social sciences to create successful AI health communication."
23725940,The assessment of emotional intelligence among candidates interviewing for general surgery residency,Dana T Lin,"Background: There is an increasing demand for physicians to possess strong personal and social qualities embodied in the concept of emotional intelligence (EI). However, the residency selection process emphasizes mainly academic accomplishments. In this system, the faculty interview is the primary means of evaluating the nontangible, nonacademic attributes of a candidate. Objective: To determine whether the impressions derived from faculty interviews correlate with an applicant's actual EI as measured by a validated objective instrument. Study design: Participating applicants interviewing for a surgical residency position at Stanford completed an EI inventory Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue). Faculty estimated the EI of the applicants they interviewed using a corresponding 360° evaluation form. Multivariate linear regression was performed to identify demographic and academic factors predictive of EI. Applicant TEIQue scores and faculty 360° impressions were correlated using Pearson coefficients. Results: Mean EI of the cohort was higher than that of the average population (5.43 vs 4.89, p<0.001). Age was the only demographic variable that significantly informed EI (B = 0.07, p = 0.005). Among the academic factors considered, United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 score was a slight negative predictor of EI (B =-0.007, p = 0.04). Applicant global EI scores did not correlate with faculty impressions of overall EI (r = 0.27, p = 0.06). Of the 4 domains that comprise global EI, sociability and emotionality demonstrated a moderate correlation between applicant and faculty scores (r = 0.31, p = 0.03 and r = 0.27, p = 0.05, respectively). None of the fifteen individual facets of EI demonstrated any correlation between applicant and faculty ratings (r =-0.12 to 0.26, p = 0.06-0.91). No association was found between applicant TEIQue and traditional faculty interview evaluations (r = 0.18, p = 0.19). Conclusions: Applicant EI correlated poorly with academic parameters and was not accurately assessed by faculty interviews. Methods that better capture this dimension should be incorporated into the residency selection process."
23725416,Trait emotional intelligence and inflammatory diseases,Sebastiano Costa,"Researchers have become increasingly interested in the psychological aspects of inflammatory disorders. Within this line of research, the present study compares the trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) profiles of 827 individuals with various inflammatory conditions (rheumatoid arthritis [RA], ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, and RA plus one comorbidity) against 496 healthy controls. Global trait EI scores did not show significant differences between these groups, although some differences were observed when comparisons were carried out against alternative control groups. Significant differences were found on the trait EI factors of Well-being (where the healthy group scored higher than the RA group) and Sociability (where the healthy group scored higher than both the RA group and the RA plus one comorbidity group). The discussion centers on the multifarious links and interplay between emotions and inflammatory conditions."
23725354,Clinical features of familial juvenile cases of moyamoya disease: analysis of patients treated in a single institute over a 28-year period,Maki Mukawa,"Object: The authors compared the clinical features between familial and sporadic cases of moyamoya disease (MMD) by retrospectively analyzing data on patients with MMD registered in the database of Tokyo Medical and Dental University over a period of 28 years. Methods: In total, 383 patients with hospital records at Tokyo Medical and Dental University from 1980 to 2007 were registered into the database. The data on all of these patients were retrospectively reviewed to clarify the occurrence of familial cases. Clinical features of child or adolescent patients (< 20 years of age) with MMD were compared between familial and sporadic cases in a subgroup of patients who were registered after 1995, initially diagnosed using MR angiography, and assessed using an intelligence scale. Results: Familial occurrence was observed in 59 patients (15.4%) in 40 pedigrees. The clinical features of juvenile patients were analyzed in 124 patients, 22 (17.7%) of whom had familial histories. In comparison with the sporadic cases, patients with familial histories were significantly younger at onset (4.7 vs 6.6 years old), had significantly more cortical infarction (59.1% vs 25.5%), and had significantly more stenoocclusive lesions in the posterior cerebral artery (45.4% vs 24.5%). The rate of patients with intellectual disturbance (intelligence quotient < 75) was significantly larger in the familial cases (47.4%) than in the sporadic cases (17.8%). Conclusions: This survey of the clinical features of familial MMD suggests that patients with familial MMD had a more serious clinical course in childhood than the sporadic MMD cases."
25690381,The Digital Health Scorecard: A New Health Literacy Metric for NCD Prevention and Care,Scott C Ratzan,"According to the World Health Organization, 3 out of 5 deaths worldwide are due to common, chronic conditions, such as heart and respiratory diseases, cancer, and diabetes. These noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are linked to multiple lifestyle risk factors, including smoking, the harmful use of alcohol, and physical inactivity. They are associated with other ""intermediate"" risk factors, such as elevated body mass index (BMI), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia. Taking action to reduce these 7 risk factors can help people protect themselves against leading causes of death. All of these risk factors are measurable and modifiable, but globally available, cost-effective, and easy-to-use outcome metrics that can drive action on all levels do not yet exist. The Digital Health Scorecard is being proposed as a dynamic, globally available digital tool to raise public, professional, and policy maker NCD health literacy (the motivation and ability to access, understand, communicate, and use information to improve health and reduce the incidence of NCD). Its aim is to motivate and empower individuals to make the behavioral and choice changes needed to improve their health and reduce NCD risk factors by giving unprecedented access to global data intelligence, creating awareness, making links to professional and community-based support services and policies, and providing a simple way to measure and track risk changes. Moreover, it provides health care professionals, communities, institutions, workplaces, and nations with a simple metric to monitor progress toward agreed local, national, and global NCD targets."
23724180,Concurrent validity of persian version of wechsler intelligence scale for children - fourth edition and cognitive assessment system in patients with learning disorder,Reza Rostami,"Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the Persian version of the wechsler intelligence scale for children - fourth edition (WISC-IV) and cognitive assessment system (CAS) tests, to determine the correlation between their scales and to evaluate the probable concurrent validity of these tests in patients with learning disorders. Methods: One-hundered-sixty-two children with learning disorder who were presented at Atieh Comprehensive Psychiatry Center were selected in a consecutive non-randomized order. All of the patients were assessed based on WISC-IV and CAS scores questionnaires. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the correlation between the data and to assess the concurrent validity of the two tests. Linear regression was used for statistical modeling. The type one error was considered 5% in maximum. Findings: There was a strong correlation between total score of WISC-IV test and total score of CAS test in the patients (r=0.75, P<0.001). The correlations among the other scales were mostly high and all of them were statistically significant (P<0.001). A linear regression model was obtained (α = 0.51, β = 0.81 and P<0.001). Conclusion: There is an acceptable correlation between the WISC-IV scales and CAS test in children with learning disorders. A concurrent validity is established between the two tests and their scales."
23722958,Efficiency of the dry-wet method for the MALDI-MSI analysis of latent fingermarks,Leesa S Ferguson,"Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) has proven to be a powerful analytical tool to investigate problems in several fields of life science. A novel application is in the field of forensics, particularly in the analysis of latent fingermarks. This technology enables images of the fingermark ridge detail and additional intelligence to be simultaneously obtained. Although several methods are available to deposit the MALDI matrix, to make the technology forensically operational, another deposition approach was devised and reported, namely the 'dry-wet' method. In the present study, the efficiency of the dry-wet method was evaluated and compared with the conventional spray coat methodology. Results indicate that the dry-wet method is superior for all the donors' typologies in terms of ion signal intensity and clarity of the ridge details. To underpin the reasons of this efficiency, scanning electron microscopy analyses were carried out in parallel to MALDI-MSI experiments using matrices of different particle size. Results have confirmed that the particle size plays an important role in the efficiency of the method as higher quality images and higher intensity spectra are produced as the matrix particle size decreases."
23722949,"Working memory, fluid intelligence, and impulsiveness in heavy media multitaskers",Meredith Minear,"Ophir, Nass, and Wagner (Proceedings of the National Association of Sciences 106:15583-15587, 2009) reported that individuals who routinely engage in multiple forms of media use are actually worse at multitasking, possibly due to difficulties in ignoring irrelevant stimuli, from both external sources and internal representations in memory. Using the media multitasking index (MMI) developed by Ophir et al., we identified heavy media multitaskers (HMMs) and light media multitaskers (LMMs) and tested them on measures of attention, working memory, task switching, and fluid intelligence, as well as self-reported impulsivity and self-control. We found that people who reported engaging in heavy amounts of media multitasking reported being more impulsive and performed more poorly on measures of fluid intelligence than did those who did not frequently engage in media multitasking. However, we could find no evidence to support the contention that HMMs are worse in a multitasking situation such as task switching or that they show any deficits in dealing with irrelevant or distracting information, as compared with LMMs."
23721727,Architecture of cognitive flexibility revealed by lesion mapping,Aron K Barbey,"Neuroscience has made remarkable progress in understanding the architecture of human intelligence, identifying a distributed network of brain structures that support goal-directed, intelligent behavior. However, the neural foundations of cognitive flexibility and adaptive aspects of intellectual function remain to be well characterized. Here, we report a human lesion study (n=149) that investigates the neural bases of key competencies of cognitive flexibility (i.e., mental flexibility and the fluent generation of new ideas) and systematically examine their contributions to a broad spectrum of cognitive and social processes, including psychometric intelligence (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), emotional intelligence (Mayer, Salovey, Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test), and personality (Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Personality Inventory). Latent variable modeling was applied to obtain error-free indices of each factor, followed by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to elucidate their neural substrates. Regression analyses revealed that latent scores for psychometric intelligence reliably predict latent scores for cognitive flexibility (adjusted R(2)=0.94). Lesion mapping results further indicated that these convergent processes depend on a shared network of frontal, temporal, and parietal regions, including white matter association tracts, which bind these areas into an integrated system. A targeted analysis of the unique variance explained by cognitive flexibility further revealed selective damage within the right superior temporal gyrus, a region known to support insight and the recognition of novel semantic relations. The observed findings motivate an integrative framework for understanding the neural foundations of adaptive behavior, suggesting that core elements of cognitive flexibility emerge from a distributed network of brain regions that support specific competencies for human intelligence."
23720643,Quantitative deficits of preschool children at risk for mathematical learning disability,Felicia W Chu,"The study tested the hypothesis that acuity of the potentially inherent approximate number system (ANS) contributes to risk of mathematical learning disability (MLD). Sixty-eight (35 boys) preschoolers at risk for school failure were assessed on a battery of quantitative tasks, and on intelligence, executive control, preliteracy skills, and parental education. Mathematics achievement scores at the end of 1 year of preschool indicated that 34 of these children were at high risk for MLD. Relative to the 34 typically achieving children, the at risk children were less accurate on the ANS task, and a one standard deviation deficit on this task resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in the odds of MLD status. The at risk children also had a poor understanding of ordinal relations, and had slower learning of Arabic numerals, number words, and their cardinal values. Poor performance on these tasks resulted in 3.6- to 4.5-fold increases in the odds of MLD status. The results provide some support for the ANS hypothesis but also suggest these deficits are not the primary source of poor mathematics learning."
23719623,"Ordered delinquency: the ""effects"" of birth order on delinquency",Patrick R Cundiff,"Juvenile delinquency has long been associated with birth order in popular culture. While images of the middle child acting out for attention or the rebellious youngest child readily spring to mind, little research has attempted to explain why. Drawing from Adlerian birth order theory and Sulloway's born-to-rebel hypothesis, I examine the relationship between birth order and a variety of delinquent outcomes during adolescence. Following some recent research on birth order and intelligence, I use new methods that allow for the examination of between-individual and within-family differences to better address the potential spurious relationship. My findings suggest that contrary to popular belief, the relationship between birth order and delinquency is spurious. Specifically, I find that birth order effects on delinquency are spurious and largely products of the analytic methods used in previous tests of the relationship. The implications of this finding are discussed."
23717520,Does perceived physical attractiveness in adolescence predict better socioeconomic position in adulthood? Evidence from 20 years of follow up in a population cohort study,Michaela Benzeval,"There is believed to be a 'beauty premium' in key life outcomes: it is thought that people perceived to be more physically attractive have better educational outcomes, higher-status jobs, higher wages, and are more likely to marry. Evidence for these beliefs, however, is generally based on photographs in hypothetical experiments or studies of very specific population subgroups (such as college students). The extent to which physical attractiveness might have a lasting effect on such outcomes in 'real life' situations across the whole population is less well known. Using longitudinal data from a general population cohort of people in the West of Scotland, this paper investigated the association between physical attractiveness at age 15 and key socioeconomic outcomes approximately 20 years later. People assessed as more physically attractive at age 15 had higher socioeconomic positions at age 36- in terms of their employment status, housing tenure and income - and they were more likely to be married; even after adjusting for parental socioeconomic background, their own intelligence, health and self esteem, education and other adult socioeconomic outcomes. For education the association was significant for women but not for men. Understanding why attractiveness is strongly associated with long-term socioeconomic outcomes, after such extensive confounders have been considered, is important."
23717453,Failure of working memory training to enhance cognition or intelligence,Todd W Thompson,"Fluid intelligence is important for successful functioning in the modern world, but much evidence suggests that fluid intelligence is largely immutable after childhood. Recently, however, researchers have reported gains in fluid intelligence after multiple sessions of adaptive working memory training in adults. The current study attempted to replicate and expand those results by administering a broad assessment of cognitive abilities and personality traits to young adults who underwent 20 sessions of an adaptive dual n-back working memory training program and comparing their post-training performance on those tests to a matched set of young adults who underwent 20 sessions of an adaptive attentional tracking program. Pre- and post-training measurements of fluid intelligence, standardized intelligence tests, speed of processing, reading skills, and other tests of working memory were assessed. Both training groups exhibited substantial and specific improvements on the trained tasks that persisted for at least 6 months post-training, but no transfer of improvement was observed to any of the non-trained measurements when compared to a third untrained group serving as a passive control. These findings fail to support the idea that adaptive working memory training in healthy young adults enhances working memory capacity in non-trained tasks, fluid intelligence, or other measures of cognitive abilities."
23714104,Naming Test of the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery: reliability and validity in a sample of patients with acquired brain injury,Dennis J Zgaljardic,"The current study assessed the internal consistency, alternate forms reliability, and convergent/divergent validity of the Naming Test of the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB) in patients with acquired brain injury. Fifty-nine patients were administered the NAB Naming Test (forms 1 and 2) and the Boston Naming Test (BNT), as well as other tests of neuropsychological functioning. Forms 1 and 2 of the NAB Naming Test demonstrated adequate internal consistency and alternate forms reliability. The NAB Naming Test was significantly associated with scores from the BNT, as well as scores from tests that assess visuospatial skills, semantic fluency, and verbal memory. The divergent validity of the NAB Naming Test was demonstrated by non-significant associations with tests of attention and processing speed. BNT scores correlated significantly with the educational level and estimated premorbid intelligence but not age, whereas the NAB Naming Test scores only correlated significantly with estimated premorbid intelligence. The current study provides independent validation supporting the utility of the NAB Naming Test for patients with acquired brain injury."
23711630,Prevalence and risk factors of inpatient aggression by adults with intellectual disabilities and severe challenging behaviour: a long-term prospective study in two Dutch treatment facilities,Klaus H Drieschner,"Over five years, various types of aggressive incidents by 421 intellectually disabled inpatients were recorded on a daily basis, using an adapted version of the Modified Overt Aggression Scale. Stable patient characteristics (e.g., gender, intelligence, DSM IV classification at the start of treatment) and pre-treatment scores of two treatment outcome measures (e.g., Adult Behavior Checklist and Dynamic Risk Outcome Scale) were used to predict aggression during the treatment. At an overall average of one incident per patient per week, about ten times more aggression occurred on admission compared to resocialisation wards, and the 20% most aggressive individuals caused 50% of the verbal and 80% of the physical incidents. The best predictor of aggressive behaviour was aggression early in treatment, followed by coping skills deficits and impulsiveness. The relevance of the results for the treatment of aggressive behaviour and methodological issues in the recording of inpatient aggression are discussed."
23711103,Infant attention and early childhood executive function,Kimberly Cuevas,"Individual differences in infant attention are theorized to reflect the speed of information processing and are related to later cognitive abilities (i.e., memory, language, and intelligence). This study provides the first systematic longitudinal analysis of infant attention and early childhood executive function (EF; e.g., working memory, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility). A group of 5-month-olds (n = 201) were classified as short or long lookers. At 24, 36, and 48 months of age, children completed age-appropriate EF tasks. Infant short lookers (i.e., more efficient information processors) exhibited higher EF throughout early childhood as compared to infant long lookers, even after controlling for verbal ability (a potential indicator of intelligence). These findings are discussed in relation to the emergence of executive attention."
23710758,Similarities and differences in borderline and organic personality disorder,Birgit B Mathiesen,"Introduction: Previous research has shown that brain injury patients with Organic Personality Disorder (OPD) may display ""borderline"" traits due to prefrontal damage, and their personality structure may be unstable and close to a borderline personality organisation. They may have few general neuropsychological dysfunctions but specific executive deficits. Similar deficits have been found in patients with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The objective of this study was to identify differences and similarities between the neuropsychological and personality profiles of BPD and OPD patients. Methods: Twenty BPD patients and 24 OPD patients were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Disorders (SCID-II), the Karolinska Psychodynamic Profile (KAPP), and a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Results: Very few neuropsychological differences were found between the two patient groups. However, the verbal fluency, verbal intelligence, verbal memory, and immediate auditory memory/attention of the BPD patients were significantly poorer than the OPD patients'. The KAPP profiles of the BPD patients showed significantly poorer functioning in three areas: frustration tolerance, the body as a factor of self-esteem, and overall personality organisation. Conclusions: These results support our clinical experience and expectations concerning the severity of symptoms of both patient groups. We suggest considering in depth assessments of both neuropsychological and personality-related problems for each of these patients in order to inform treatment."
23710617,Cognitive reserve as a moderator of responsiveness to an online problem-solving intervention for adolescents with complicated mild-to-severe traumatic brain injury,Christine L Karver,"Children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury (TBI) often experience behavior difficulties that may arise from problem-solving deficits and impaired self-regulation. However, little is known about the relationship of neurocognitive ability to post-TBI behavioral recovery. To address this question, we examined whether verbal intelligence, as estimated by Vocabulary scores from the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, predicted improvements in behavior and executive functioning following a problem-solving intervention for adolescents with TBI. One hundred and thirty-two adolescents with complicated mild-to-severe TBI were randomly assigned to a six-month Web-based problem-solving intervention (CAPS; n = 65) or to an Internet resource comparison (IRC; n = 67) group. Vocabulary moderated the association between treatment group and improvements in metacognitive abilities. Examination of the mean estimates indicated that for those with lower Vocabulary scores, pre-intervention Metacognition Index scores from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) did not differ between the groups, but post-intervention scores were significantly lower (more improved) for those in the CAPS group. These findings suggest that low verbal intelligence was associated with greater improvements in executive functioning following the CAPS intervention and that verbal intelligence may have an important role in response to intervention for TBI. Understanding predictors of responsiveness to interventions allows clinicians to tailor treatments to individuals, thus improving efficacy."
23709414,Missing data analysis in drug-naïve Alzheimer's disease with behavioral and psychological symptoms,Yong Tae Kwak,"Purpose: To clarify the effects of missing values due to behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients on the neuropsychological tests, this study describes the pattern of missing values due to BPSD, and its influence on tests. Materials and methods: Drug-naïve probable AD patients (n=127) with BPSD and without BPSD (n=32) were assessed with Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery including measures of memory, intelligence, and executive functioning. Moreover, patients were rated on Korean Neuropsychiatry Inventory (K-NPI). Results: The more severe the K-NPI score, the less neuropsychological tests were assessable, leading to many missing values. Patients with BPSD were more severely demented than those without BPSD. K-NPI scores were significantly correlated with the number of missing values. The effect of BPSD was largest for tests measuring frontal functions. The replacement of the missing values due to BPSD by the lowest observed score also showed the largest effect on tests of frontal function. Conclusion: The global cognitive and behavior scales are related with missing values. Among K-NPI sub-domains, delusion, depressing, apathy, and aberrant motor behavior are significantly correlated for missing values. Data imputation of missing values due to BPSD provides a more differentiated picture of cognitive deficits in AD with BPSD."
23708217,Surgical effects of focus resection for patients with intractable epilepsy,Taketoshi Maehara,"Postoperative seizure-free outcome, psychiatric condition, intellectual function, and employment status were reviewed to demonstrate the usefulness of focus resection in 71 patients who underwent resective epilepsy surgery between 2000 and 2010 for the treatment of medication-resistant epilepsy. The psychiatric problems were assumed to be present only if the patient received psychotropic drug therapy. Seizure-free outcome was obtained in 53 (75%) patients. The patients were followed up for 2.0-12.0 years (mean 7.2 years) after surgery. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), late seizure onset, short seizure duration, and magnetic resonance imaging lesions were all significantly associated with cessation of seizures. Psychotropic drug therapy was performed in 3 (4.2%) patients before surgery and in 12 (17.0%) patients at 2 years or later after surgery. TLE and preoperative psychotropic drugs were significantly associated with postoperative psychiatric problems. Among the 71 patients, 65 underwent full Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) examinations both before and after surgery. The mean WAIS-R score was 82.5 ± 18.7 points for total intelligence quotient (IQ) preoperatively and 89.6 ± 20.3 points for total IQ postoperatively. Before surgery, 19 (27%) patients were engaged in full-time employment. After surgery, 2 patients lost and 9 patients newly entered full-time employment, so a total of 26 (37%) patients were engaged in full-time employment after surgery. Resective epilepsy surgery resulted in overall improvements in seizure control, intellectual functions, and employment status. However, patients with TLE had some risk of postoperative psychiatric disorder."
23707433,A strong interactive link between sensory discriminations and intelligence,Michael D Melnick,"Early psychologists, including Galton, Cattell, and Spearman, proposed that intelligence and simple sensory discriminations are constrained by common neural processes, predicting a close link between them. However, strong supporting evidence for this hypothesis remains elusive. Although people with higher intelligence quotients (IQs) are quicker at processing sensory stimuli, these broadly replicated findings explain a relatively modest proportion of variance in IQ. Processing speed alone is, arguably, a poor match for the information processing demands on the neural system. Our brains operate on overwhelming amounts of information, and thus their efficiency is fundamentally constrained by an ability to suppress irrelevant information. Here, we show that individual variability in a simple visual discrimination task that reflects both processing speed and perceptual suppression strongly correlates with IQ. High-IQ individuals, although quick at perceiving small moving objects, exhibit disproportionately large impairments in perceiving motion as stimulus size increases. These findings link intelligence with low-level sensory suppression of large moving patterns--background-like stimuli that are ecologically less relevant. We conjecture that the ability to suppress irrelevant and rapidly process relevant information fundamentally constrains both sensory discriminations and intelligence, providing an information-processing basis for the observed link."
23706971,Using King's interacting systems theory to link emotional intelligence and nursing practice,Linda L Shanta,"King's theory is a broad theory designed to provide a framework for nursing (I.M. King, 1981), whereas emotional intelligence (EI; J.D. Mayer & P. Salovey, 2004) is a theory that is specific for addressing potential competency in dealing with emotions and emotional information. J.D. Mayer, P. Salovey, D.R. Caruso, and G. Sitarenios (2001) defined EI as the ""ability to recognize the meaning of emotions and their relationships and to use them as a basis for reasoning and problem solving"" (p. 234). These researchers believed that EI is related to cognitive intellect through the ability to use reasoning by way of information to find meaning. J.D. Mayer and P. Salovey (2004) argued that the skills that comprise EI were likely enhanced through obtaining a liberal education infused with values exploration. J.D. Mayer, P. Salovey, D.R. Caruso, and G. Sitarenios (2001) contended that there are 4 branches of abilities that create EI: (a) the skill of perceiving emotion within oneself and others, (b) assimilation of an emotion to facilitate thinking, (c) understanding and knowledge of emotion, and (d) conscious regulation of emotion. Each level or branch builds upon the previous one, and awareness of what each branch offers the individual in enhancing relationships with others is a key component of healthy emotional interactions. This article will provide a theoretic foundation based upon King's interacting systems theory (IST; 1981) that embraces EI as a crucial component in the nurse's ability to provide holistic care for patients, peers, and themselves. King's IST underscores the necessity of nurses possessing abilities of EI as they care for others but does not fully describe a mechanism to understand and incorporate emotions within the complex nurse-patient interactions and communications that are part of the nursing process."
23706508,Effect of inadequate iodine status in UK pregnant women on cognitive outcomes in their children: results from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC),Sarah C Bath,"Background: As a component of thyroid hormones, iodine is essential for fetal brain development. Although the UK has long been considered iodine replete, increasing evidence suggests that it might now be mildly iodine deficient. We assessed whether mild iodine deficiency during early pregnancy was associated with an adverse effect on child cognitive development. Methods: We analysed mother-child pairs from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort by measuring urinary iodine concentration (and creatinine to correct for urine volume) in stored samples from 1040 first-trimester pregnant women. We selected women on the basis of a singleton pregnancy and availability of both a urine sample from the first trimester (defined as ≤13 weeks' gestation; median 10 weeks [IQR 9-12]) and a measure of intelligence quotient (IQ) in the offspring at age 8 years. Women's results for iodine-to-creatinine ratio were dichotomised to less than 150 μg/g or 150 μg/g or more on the basis of WHO criteria for iodine deficiency or sufficiency in pregnancy. We assessed the association between maternal iodine status and child IQ at age 8 years and reading ability at age 9 years. We included 21 socioeconomic, parental, and child factors as confounders. Findings: The group was classified as having mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency on the basis of a median urinary iodine concentration of 91·1 μg/L (IQR 53·8-143; iodine-to-creatinine ratio 110 μg/g, IQR 74-170). After adjustment for confounders, children of women with an iodine-to-creatinine ratio of less than 150 μg/g were more likely to have scores in the lowest quartile for verbal IQ (odds ratio 1·58, 95% CI 1·09-2·30; p=0·02), reading accuracy (1·69, 1·15-2·49; p=0·007), and reading comprehension (1·54, 1·06-2·23; p=0·02) than were those of mothers with ratios of 150 μg/g or more. When the less than 150 μg/g group was subdivided, scores worsened ongoing from 150 μg/g or more, to 50-150 μg/g, to less than 50 μg/g. Interpretation: Our results show the importance of adequate iodine status during early gestation and emphasise the risk that iodine deficiency can pose to the developing infant, even in a country classified as only mildly iodine deficient. Iodine deficiency in pregnant women in the UK should be treated as an important public health issue that needs attention. Funding: None."
23705673,An analysis of the criteria used to diagnose children with Nonverbal Learning Disability (NLD),Irene C Mammarella,"Based on a review of the literature, the diagnostic criteria used for children with nonverbal learning disabilities (NLD) were identified as follows: (a) low visuospatial intelligence; (b) discrepancy between verbal and visuospatial intelligence; (c) visuoconstructive and fine-motor coordination skills; (d) visuospatial memory tasks; (e) reading better than mathematical achievement; and (f) socioemotional skills. An analysis of the effect size was used to investigate the strength of criteria for diagnosing NLD considering 35 empirical studies published from January 1980 to February 2011. Overall, our results showed that the most important criteria for distinguishing children with NLD from controls were as follows: a low visuospatial intelligence with a relatively good verbal intelligence, visuoconstructive and fine-motor coordination impairments, good reading decoding together with low math performance. Deficits in visuospatial memory and social skills were also present. A preliminary set of criteria for diagnosing NLD was developed on these grounds. It was concluded, however, that-although some consensus is emerging-further research is needed to definitively establish shared diagnostic criteria for children with NLD."
23705230,Explicit and implicit attitudes toward standard-Japanese and Osaka-dialect language use],Takumi Watanabe,"This article examines the effects of language use on explicit and implicit attitudes. We employed the matched-guise technique to measure participants' impressions of standard-Japanese and Osaka-dialect speakers. Implicit attitudes were assessed by the Implicit Association Test (IAT). The Osaka-dialect speaker was evaluated as warmer than the standard-Japanese speaker, suggesting that explicit attitudes toward the Osaka dialect have changed positively. On the other hand, the results for the impression of intelligence were consistent with the previous literature that the standard-Japanese speaker was seen as more intelligent than the Osaka-dialect speaker. Compared with explicit attitudes, the analyses of implicit attitudes revealed that participants showed a consistent implicit bias favoring standard-Japanese language use. The changing processes and relationships of explicit and implicit attitudes were discussed."
23703598,Development and application of a web-based expert system using artificial intelligence for management of mental health by Korean emigrants],Jeongyee Bae,"Purpose: The purpose of this project was to develop an international web-based expert system using principals of artificial intelligence and user-centered design for management of mental health by Korean emigrants. Using this system, anyone can access the system via computer access to the web. Methods: Our design process utilized principles of user-centered design with 4 phases: needs assessment, analysis, design/development/testing, and application release. A survey was done with 3,235 Korean emigrants. Focus group interviews were also conducted. Survey and analysis results guided the design of the web-based expert system. Results: With this system, anyone can check their mental health status by themselves using a personal computer. The system analyzes facts based on answers to automated questions, and suggests solutions accordingly. A history tracking mechanism enables monitoring and future analysis. In addition, this system will include intervention programs to promote mental health status. Conclusion: This system is interactive and accessible to anyone in the world. It is expected that this management system will contribute to Korean emigrants' mental health promotion and allow researchers and professionals to share information on mental health."
23702355,Cognitive abilities of Emirati and German engineering university students,Heiner Rindermann,"According to human capital theory, individual competences and personality attributes are relevant for individual productivity and income. Within human capital, intelligence is crucial. To study engineering and work successfully as an engineer, high cognitive abilities are necessary, especially for work in research and development. In a study of 30 German and 30 Emirati engineering students (mean age: 22 years), both groups were tested with mathematical and figural intelligence scales (CogAT). German engineering students achieved a mean IQ of 116, and Emirati students 104 (in converted UK norms). In both groups male students achieved better results than females (2 to 4 IQ point difference). The results are compared with those from PISA and TIMSS. The possible causes of these results, their consequences and strategies for improvement are discussed."
23700999,Evolutionary computation and QSAR research,Vanessa Aguiar-Pulido,"The successful high throughput screening of molecule libraries for a specific biological property is one of the main improvements in drug discovery. The virtual molecular filtering and screening relies greatly on quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis, a mathematical model that correlates the activity of a molecule with molecular descriptors. QSAR models have the potential to reduce the costly failure of drug candidates in advanced (clinical) stages by filtering combinatorial libraries, eliminating candidates with a predicted toxic effect and poor pharmacokinetic profiles, and reducing the number of experiments. To obtain a predictive and reliable QSAR model, scientists use methods from various fields such as molecular modeling, pattern recognition, machine learning or artificial intelligence. QSAR modeling relies on three main steps: molecular structure codification into molecular descriptors, selection of relevant variables in the context of the analyzed activity, and search of the optimal mathematical model that correlates the molecular descriptors with a specific activity. Since a variety of techniques from statistics and artificial intelligence can aid variable selection and model building steps, this review focuses on the evolutionary computation methods supporting these tasks. Thus, this review explains the basic of the genetic algorithms and genetic programming as evolutionary computation approaches, the selection methods for high-dimensional data in QSAR, the methods to build QSAR models, the current evolutionary feature selection methods and applications in QSAR and the future trend on the joint or multi-task feature selection methods."
23700367,Epilepsy and homicide,Neil S Pandya,"Purpose: We report the rare case of a patient with intractable epilepsy and escalating aggression, resulting in murder, who had complete resolution of her seizures and explosive behavior following a right temporal lobectomy. Patients and methods: We searched the available literature from 1880 to 2013 for cases of epilepsy being used as a court defense for murder and collected information regarding the final sentencing outcomes. We selected 15 papers with a total of 50 homicides. Results: We describe the case of a 47-year-old woman with drug-resistant right temporal epilepsy who developed increasing emotional lability, outbursts of anger and escalating violent behavior culminating in a violent murder. The patient was imprisoned while awaiting trial. In the interim, she underwent a successful temporal lobectomy with full resolution of seizures, interictal rage and aggressive behaviors. After the surgery, her charges were downgraded and she was transferred to a psychiatric facility. Conclusion: The aggressive behavior associated with epilepsy has been described in the literature for over a century. A link between epilepsy and aggression has been disproportionally emphasized. These patients share some common characteristics: they are usually young men with a long history of epilepsy and lower than average intelligence. The violent act is postictal, sudden-onset, more likely to occur after a cluster of seizures and is usually related with alcohol abuse."
23700152,"Autoimmune, atopic, and mental health comorbid conditions associated with alopecia areata in the United States",Kathie P Huang,"Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of comorbid conditions among patients with alopecia areata (AA) seen at tertiary care hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, during an 11-year period. Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Setting: Tertiary care hospitals in Boston, including Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. Participants: We identified 3568 individuals with AA seen in the Partners health care system in Boston between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2011. We performed comprehensive searches of the Research Patient Data Repository using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 704.01. We randomly selected 350 patients and manually reviewed their medical records to train and validate a novel artificial intelligence program. This program then used natural language processing to review free-text medical records and confirm a diagnosis of AA. To confirm the algorithm, we manually reviewed a subset of records and found 93.9% validity. Main outcomes and measures: The prevalence of comorbid conditions was assessed. Results: Common comorbid conditions included autoimmune diagnoses (thyroid disease in 14.6%, diabetes mellitus in 11.1%, inflammatory bowel disease in (2.0%) [corrected], systemic lupus erythematosus in 4.3%, rheumatoid arthritis in 3.9%, and psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in (6.3%) [corrected], atopy (allergic rhinitis, asthma, and/or eczema in 38.2% and contact dermatitis and other eczema in 35.9%), and mental health problems (depression or anxiety in 25.5%). We also found high prevalences of hyperlipidemia (24.5%), hypertension (21.9%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (17.3%). This profile was different from that seen in a comparison psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis group. Conclusions and relevance: We found a high prevalence of comorbid conditions among individuals with AA presenting to academic medical centers in Boston. Physicians caring for patients with AA should consider screening for comorbid conditions."
23698605,"Value of pharmacy-based influenza surveillance - Ontario, Canada, 2009",Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),"As part of ongoing efforts by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) to enhance disease surveillance, a retrospective epidemiologic study was undertaken to investigate the usefulness for influenza surveillance of data on changes in the volume of prescriptions for antiviral medications. The weekly numbers of dispensed prescriptions for the antiviral medications oseltamivir and zanamivir, as a proportion of all dispensed prescriptions, were compared with the numbers of confirmed laboratory reports of influenza A(H1N1) at the local health authority level in Ontario, Canada, during the second wave of the outbreak of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) in 2009. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrated that antiviral prescription dispensing dates were a reasonable proxy for influenza A(H1N1) onset dates at the local health authority level. This report describes the results of those analyses, which indicated that 1) antiviral prescription proportions increased in advance of laboratory reports of influenza and 2) antiviral dispensing data can be available in near real-time. These findings suggest that pharmacy prescription data can provide timely intelligence to help characterize local influenza activity."
23696406,Surgical management of pyloric stenosis induced by gastrointestinal chemical burn in children],Ji-Xiao Zeng,"Objective: To investigate the efficacy of surgical management for pyloric stenosis induced by gastrointestinal chemical burn in children. Methods: Clinical data of 11 children with pyloric stenosis induced by gastrointestinal chemical burn were analyzed retrospectively. After the failure of medicine, intervention of low balloon expansion and stent placement, they underwent pylorectomy and gastroduodenostomy. The body weight, height, serum albumin, hemoglobin, transferrin were compared between 1 day before and 3 months after operation. Results: There were 10 males and 1 female with a mean age of 4.5 years old. The main cause of serious pyloric stenosis was the wrong intake of hydrochloric acid. Lesions involved the esophagus and stomach in the early stage, and 4 weeks later, the lesion mainly involved the pylorus, which resulted in scarring pyloric stenosis and complete pyloric obstruction. Pylorectomy and gastroduodenostomy was successfully performed. The mean operative time was (134±26) min. The estimated blood loss was (5±2) ml. The postoperative length of stay was (10±3) d. There were no surgical complications. During the follow-up of 3 months, all the patients resumed regular diet. The height, body weight, and intelligence appeared to be normal. They showed significant improvement in weight, serum albumin, globulin, hemoglobin, transferrin at 3 months after the surgery(P<0.05). Six months after surgery, the anastomosis was shown to be nornal in barium follow through exam with no signs of stricture of ulcer. Conclusion: Pylorectomy and gastroduodenostomy is an effective management for pyloric stenosis induced by gastrointestinal chemical burn in children, whose short-term efficacy is good."
23696339,"Adaptive skills, cognitive functioning and behavioural problems in adolescents with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome]",D Dewulf,"Background: The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) has a highly variable phenotype with a multitude of somatic and psychiatric features. Little is known about the adaptive skills of adolescents with 22q11.2DS. Aim: To investigate adaptive functioning, intelligence and behavioural problems and their interrelationship in adolescents with 22q11.2DS. Method: We interviewed the parents of 37 adolescents with 22q11.2DS using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. We assessed the intelligence of the adolescents by means of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales. Parents, adolescents and teachers were required to complete the Achenbach behavioural questionnaire. Results: We found that adolescents with 22q11.2DS had impaired adaptive skills; these skills were significantly more impaired than the adolescents’ overall intelligence, i.e. their I.Q. Socialisation was a relatively well-developed domain compared to daily living skills. All respondents reported that the number of internalising problems exceeded the number of externalising problems. There was no correlation between adaptive functioning and behavioural problems, age or gender. Conclusion: The evaluation of adaptive skills in these adolescents is a first step on the road to the development of measures aimed at improving their functioning in society."
23696132,Social attention in a virtual public speaking task in higher functioning children with autism,William Jarrold,"Impairments in social attention play a major role in autism, but little is known about their role in development after preschool. In this study, a public speaking task was used to study social attention, its moderators, and its association with classroom learning in elementary and secondary students with higher functioning autism spectrum disorder (HFASD). Thirty-seven students with HFASD and 54 age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched peers without symptoms of ASD were assessed in a virtual classroom public speaking paradigm. This paradigm assessed the ability to attend to nine avatar peers seated at a table, while simultaneously answering self-referenced questions. Students with HFASD looked less frequently to avatar peers in the classroom while talking. However, social attention was moderated in the HFASD sample such that students with lower IQ, and/or more symptoms of social anxiety, and/or more attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder inattentive symptoms, displayed more atypical social attention. Group differences were more pronounced when the classroom contained social avatars versus nonsocial targets. Moreover, measures of social attention rather than nonsocial attention were significantly associated with parent report and objective measures of learning in the classroom. The data in this study support the hypothesis of the Social Attention Model of ASD that social attention disturbance remains part of the school-aged phenotype of autism that is related to syndrome-specific problems in social learning. More research of this kind would likely contribute to advances in the understanding of the development of the spectrum of autism and educational intervention approaches for affected school-aged children."
23695915,Characterizing discourse deficits following penetrating head injury: a preliminary model,Carl Coelho,"Purpose: Discourse analyses have demonstrated utility for delineating subtle communication deficits following closed head injuries (CHIs). The present investigation examined the discourse performance of a large group of individuals with penetrating head injury (PHI). Performance was also compared across 6 subgroups of PHI based on lesion locale. A preliminary model of discourse production following PHI was proposed and tested. Method: Story narratives were elicited from 2 groups of participants, 167 with PHI and 46 non brain-injured (NBI). Micro- and macrostructural components of each story were analyzed. Measures of memory, executive functions, and intelligence were also administered. All measures were compared across groups and PHI subgroups. The proposed model of discourse production was tested with a structural equation modeling procedure. Results: No differences for the discourse measures were noted across the six PHI subgroups. Three measures distinguished the PHI and NBI groups: narrative length, story grammar, and completeness. The proposed model of discourse production had an adequate-to-good fit with the cognitive and discourse data. Conclusion: In spite of differing mechanisms of injury, the PHI group's discourse performance was consistent with what has been reported for individuals with CHI. The model tested represents a preliminary step toward understanding discourse production following traumatic brain injury."
23695270,Relations among upper-limb movement organization and cognitive function at school age in children born preterm,Erik Domellöf,"Objective: To explore relations between aspects of upper-body spatiotemporal movement organization and intelligence in children born preterm at school age. Methods: Three-dimensional (3D) kinematic recordings of arm and head movements during a unimanual precision task were related to performance on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition, in a sample of 32 children born preterm (gestational age, mean: 31.5 weeks [range: 22-35 weeks]; birth weight, mean: 1699 g [range: 404-2962 g]) at 6 years to 8 years with no diagnosed cognitive, sensory, or motor impairments compared with 40 age-matched control children born fullterm. Results: In the children born preterm, upper-limb movement duration and segmentation of movement trajectories were significantly associated with full-scale intelligence quotient independent of gestational age (GA) and sex. These effects pertained to the preferred side, characterized by more effective movement organization being linked with increased intelligence scores. The same relations were not seen in the controls. Within the children born preterm, a significant effect of GA was also found for some aspects of upper-limb movement organization. Full-scale intelligence quotient was within normal limits for both groups but significantly lower in the preterm (mean: 94.5 [range: 72-120]) compared with the fullterm (mean: 101.7 [range: 76-119]) born children. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that, independent of GA, the spatiotemporal organization of upper-limb movements is partly associated with cognitive performance in children born preterm."
23692537,Vocational interests of intellectually gifted and highly achieving young adults,Miriam Vock,"Background: Vocational interests play a central role in the vocational decision-making process and are decisive for the later job satisfaction and vocational success. Based on Ackerman's (1996) notion of trait complexes, specific interest profiles of gifted high-school graduates can be expected. Aims: Vocational interests of gifted and highly achieving adolescents were compared to those of their less intelligent/achieving peers according to Holland's (1997) RIASEC model. Further, the impact of intelligence and achievement on interests were analysed while statistically controlling for potentially influencing variables. Changes in interests over time were investigated. Sample: N= 4,694 German students (age: M= 19.5, SD= .80; 54.6% females) participated in the study (TOSCA; Köller, Watermann, Trautwein, & Lüdtke, 2004). Method: Interests were assessed in participants' final year at school and again 2 years later (N= 2,318). Results: Gifted participants reported stronger investigative and realistic interests, but lower social interests than less intelligent participants. Highly achieving participants reported higher investigative and (in wave 2) higher artistic interests. Considerable gender differences were found: gifted girls had a flat interest profile, while gifted boys had pronounced realistic and investigative and low social interests. Multilevel multiple regression analyses predicting interests by intelligence and school achievement revealed stable interest profiles. Beyond a strong gender effect, intelligence and school achievement each contributed substantially to the prediction of vocational interests. Conclusions: At the time around graduation from high school, gifted young adults show stable interest profiles, which strongly differ between gender and intelligence groups. These differences are relevant for programmes for the gifted and for vocational counselling."
23689433,Problems of aggressive behaviour and its measurement in various age levels. Introduction of two questionnaires],János Csorba,"Authors give a detailed overview on aspects of aggressive behaviour in childhood and adolescence especially on the basis of the literature of the last two decades, then. the measurement opportunities of aggression is discussed. The Children's Aggression Scale- parent version (Halperin et al 2002) rated by parents is presented and Hungarian validity data are published. In the second part of the publication, authors focus on the viewpoints of differences between aggressiveness of IQ deficit people and those of having normal intelligence, preliminary experiences are reported about the behavioural dimensions of intellectually disabled (ID) patients rated by the Behaviour Problem Inventory (BPI, Rojahn et al, 2001) suitable for measuring frequency and severity of behavioural qualities of both ID adolescents and adults."
23688802,What are we to make of the concept of race? Thoughts of a philosopher-scientist,Massimo Pigliucci,"Discussions about the biological bases (or lack thereof) of the concept of race in the human species seem to be never ending. One of the latest rounds is represented by a paper by Neven Sesardic, which attempts to build a strong scientific case for the existence of human races, based on genetic, morphometric and behavioral characteristics, as well as on a thorough critique of opposing positions. In this paper I show that Sesardic's critique falls far short of the goal, and that his positive case is exceedingly thin. I do this through a combination of analysis of the actual scientific findings invoked by Sesardic and of some philosophical unpacking of his conceptual analysis, drawing on a dual professional background as an evolutionary biologist and a philosopher of science."
23688173,"Working memory training and transfer in older adults: effects of age, baseline performance, and training gains",Katharina Zinke,"Recent studies suggest that working memory training may benefit older adults; however, findings regarding training and transfer effects are mixed. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of a process-based training intervention in a diverse sample of older adults and explored possible moderators of training and transfer effects. For that purpose, 80 older adults (65-95 years) were assigned either to a training group that worked on visuospatial, verbal, and executive working memory tasks for 9 sessions over 3 weeks or to a control group. Performance on trained and transfer tasks was assessed in all participants before and after the training period, as well as at a 9-month follow-up. Analyses revealed significant training effects in all 3 training tasks in trained participants relative to controls, as well as near transfer to a verbal working memory task and far transfer to a fluid intelligence task. Encouragingly, all training effects and the transfer effect to verbal working memory were stable at the 9-month follow-up session. Further analyses revealed that training gains were predicted by baseline performance in training tasks and (to a lesser degree) by age. Gains in transfer tasks were predicted by age and by the amount of improvement in the trained tasks. These findings suggest that cognitive plasticity is preserved over a large range of old age and that even a rather short training regime can lead to (partly specific) training and transfer effects. However, baseline performance, age, and training gains moderate the amount of plasticity."
23686687,6p25 microdeletion: white matter abnormalities in an adult patient,Hilary J Vernon,"We report on a 41-year-old woman of normal intelligence with a complicated past medical history including unilateral profound hearing loss, unilateral Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly, and leukoencephalopathy. She was referred to an adult neurology clinic because of a previous diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, which was non-responsive to multiple medications. Due to her complicated past medical history, the medical genetics service was consulted. She was found to have a chromosome 6p25.3-6p25.2 deletion on SNP array. This report highlights chromosome 6p subtelomeric deletions as a possible underlying cause for periventricular white matter abnormalities in an adult. It emphasizes the importance of genetic testing in an adult with leukoencephalopathy and congenital anomalies."
23685775,From neural signatures of emotional modulation to social cognition: individual differences in healthy volunteers and psychiatric participants,Agustín Ibáñez,"It is commonly assumed that early emotional signals provide relevant information for social cognition tasks. The goal of this study was to test the association between (a) cortical markers of face emotional processing and (b) social-cognitive measures, and also to build a model which can predict this association (a and b) in healthy volunteers as well as in different groups of psychiatric patients. Thus, we investigated the early cortical processing of emotional stimuli (N170, using a face and word valence task) and their relationship with the social-cognitive profiles (SCPs, indexed by measures of theory of mind, fluid intelligence, speed processing and executive functions). Group comparisons and individual differences were assessed among schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and their relatives, individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), individuals with euthymic bipolar disorder (BD) and healthy participants (educational level, handedness, age and gender matched). Our results provide evidence of emotional N170 impairments in the affected groups (SCZ and relatives, ADHD and BD) as well as subtle group differences. Importantly, cortical processing of emotional stimuli predicted the SCP, as evidenced by a structural equation model analysis. This is the first study to report an association model of brain markers of emotional processing and SCP."
23684686,Subtle post-procedural cognitive dysfunction after atrial fibrillation ablation,Caroline Medi,"Objectives: This study sought to determine whether post-operative neurocognitive dysfunction (POCD) occurs after ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). Background: Ablation for AF is a highly effective strategy; however, the risk of transient ischemic attack and stroke is approximately 0.5% to 1%. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging studies report a 7% to 14% prevalence of silent cerebral infarction. Whether cerebral ischemia results in POCD after ablation for AF is not well established. Methods: The study included 150 patients; 60 patients undergoing ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), 30 patients undergoing ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation (PeAF), and 30 patients undergoing ablation for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) were compared with a matched nonoperative control group of patients with AF awaiting radiofrequency ablation (n = 30). Eight neuropsychological tests were administered at baseline and at 2 days and 90 days post-operatively. The tests were administered at the same time points to the nonoperative control group. The reliable change index was used to calculate POCD. Results: The prevalences of POCD at day 2 post-procedure were 28% in patients with PAF, 27% in patients with PeAF, 13% in patients with SVT, and 0% in control patients with AF (p = 0.007). At day 90, the prevalences of POCD were 13% in patients with PAF, 20% in patients with PeAF, 3% in patients with SVT, and 0% in control patients with AF (p = 0.03). When analyzing the 3 procedural groups together, 29 of 120 patients (24%) manifested POCD at day 2 and 15 of 120 patients (13%) at day 90 post-procedure (p = 0.029). On univariate analysis, increasing left atrial access time was associated with POCD at day 2 (p = 0.04) and day 90 (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Ablation for AF is associated with a 13% to 20% prevalence of POCD in patients with AF at long-term follow-up. These results were seen in a patient population with predominant CHADS2 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥75 years, Diabetes mellitus, previous Stroke/transient ischemic attack) scores of 0 to 1, representing the majority of patients undergoing ablation for AF. The long-term implications of these subtle changes require further study."
23684054,Short-term remission in schizophrenia as a combination of several outcome measures,Paolo Stratta,"Clinical, cognitive, metabolic and functioning variables have been evaluated in patients with schizophrenia in an 8-week trial with Ziprasidone. The aim of this post-hoc analysis is to investigate how these variables interact in determining short-term remission. Baseline values or the variation from baseline to endpoint were considered predictors. 262 schizophrenic patients were recruited. Two logistic regressions were conducted to determine which variables predict remission. The first was performed on baseline values as predictors. The second used the variation from baseline to endpoint (delta) of the outcome evaluations as predictors. Using literature reported criteria for remission, we distinguished 124 subjects (47.33%) in remission, and 138 not in remission at the end of the trial. The first logistic regression does not show a good fit. The second logistic regression, with delta scores as predictors, reports instead an overall good fit (71.8% of the predicted cases assigned to the right category). The analysis reveals that general score from Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), cholesterol LDL, subjective well-being under neuroleptic, Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) delta scores, drug dosage and premorbid intelligence entered in the equation. These results suggest that indexes such as cognition, metabolic status, other than symptoms, have to be taken into account in order to refine the short-term remission prediction."
23683919,Perspectives for Forensic Intelligence in anti-doping: thinking outside of the box,François Marclay,"Today's approach to anti-doping is mostly centered on the judicial process, despite pursuing a further goal in the detection, reduction, solving and/or prevention of doping. Similarly to decision-making in the area of law enforcement feeding on Forensic Intelligence, anti-doping might significantly benefit from a more extensive gathering of knowledge. Forensic Intelligence might bring a broader logical dimension to the interpretation of data on doping activities for a more future-oriented and comprehensive approach instead of the traditional case-based and reactive process. Information coming from a variety of sources related to doping, whether directly or potentially, would feed an organized memory to provide real time intelligence on the size, seriousness and evolution of the phenomenon. Due to the complexity of doping, integrating analytical chemical results and longitudinal monitoring of biomarkers with physiological, epidemiological, sociological or circumstantial information might provide a logical framework enabling fit for purpose decision-making. Therefore, Anti-Doping Intelligence might prove efficient at providing a more proactive response to any potential or emerging doping phenomenon or to address existing problems with innovative actions or/and policies. This approach might prove useful to detect, neutralize, disrupt and/or prevent organized doping or the trafficking of doping agents, as well as helping to refine the targeting of athletes or teams. In addition, such an intelligence-led methodology would serve to address doping offenses in the absence of adverse analytical chemical evidence."
23683915,Forensic profiling of sassafras oils based on comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography,M Schäffer,"Safrole, the main compound in the essential oil of several plants of the Laurel family (Lauraceae), and its secondary product piperonylmethylketone are the predominantly used precursors for the illicit synthesis of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) which is, in turn, the most common active ingredient in Ecstasy tablets. Analytical methods with adequate capacity to identify links and origin of precursors, such as safrole, provide valuable information for drug-related police intelligence. Authentic sassafras oil samples from police seizures were subjected to comparative analysis based on their chemical profiles obtained by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS). The enhanced separation power and increased sensitivity of GC × GC allowed for the detection of minor compounds present in the essential oils which were of particular interest in case of very pure samples whose impurity profiles were not very pronounced. Discrimination of such samples was still possible even in the absence of characteristic main compounds."
23683905,Trends in counterfeits amphetamine-type stimulants after its prohibition in Brazil,Kristiane de Cássia Mariotti,"Brazil is one of the world's highest users of anorectic drugs, mainly diethylpropione, fenproporex and sibutramine. The present work focuses on physical and chemical characteristics of 17 counterfeited capsules containing amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) from three seizures conducted by Brazilian Federal Police. The physical profile was useful in indicating forgery, bring complementary information, but the use of this data singly was not sufficient to distinguish between authentic and counterfeited medicines. The chemical analysis revealed that the seizures capsules labeled as Desobesi-M (fenproporex 25mg), actually contained the active pharmaceutical ingrediente (API) sibutramine. The amount of this API ranged from 1/3 to 2 times the amount of drug found in commercial product, may reach twice the recommended daily dose. Multivariate analysis with application of principal component analysis on data from spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared classified the samples according to their similarities, indicating that two seizures had common origin. This study represents the first step in the elucidation of falsification of ATS in Brazil. Considering the forensic intelligence these information are valuable in order to develop and establish a database that enables correlate samples from different locations and/or suppliers and to map the profile and trends of trafficking."
23683581,The creeping Pearl: Why has the rate of contraceptive failure increased in clinical trials of combined hormonal contraceptive pills?,James Trussell,"Background: Despite several drawbacks, the Pearl Index continues to be the most widely used statistical measure of contraceptive failure. However, Pearl indices reported in studies of newer hormonal contraceptives appear to be increasing. Study design: We searched PubMed and Medical Intelligence Solutions databases for prospective trials evaluating oral contraceptive (OC) efficacy to examine potential factors that could contribute to increasing Pearl indices. Results: Numerous potential factors were identified, including an increased rate of failures of newer OCs, deficiencies in methods of calculating contraceptive failure rates, differences in study design and changes in patient populations resulting in increased rates of contraceptive failures due to the inappropriate or inconsistent use of the method. Conclusions: The two most likely important contributors to the increase in Pearl indices are more frequent pregnancy testing with more sensitive tests and less adherent study populations. Because study populations appear to be increasingly representative of the likely actual users once the product is marketed, we can expect to see even higher failure rates in ongoing and future studies. This result poses challenges for companies and regulatory agencies."
23683341,Artificial intelligence and immediacy: designing health communication to personally engage consumers and providers,Gary L Kreps,"Objective: We describe how ehealth communication programs can be improved by using artificial intelligence (AI) to increase immediacy. Methods: We analyzed major deficiencies in ehealth communication programs, illustrating how programs often fail to fully engage audiences and can even have negative consequences by undermining the effective delivery of information intended to guide health decision-making and influence adoption of health-promoting behaviors. We examined the use of AI in ehealth practices to promote immediacy and provided examples from the ChronologyMD project. Results: Strategic use of AI is shown to help enhance immediacy in ehealth programs by making health communication more engaging, relevant, exciting, and actionable. Conclusion: AI can enhance the ""immediacy"" of ehealth by humanizing health promotion efforts, promoting physical and emotional closeness, increasing authenticity and enthusiasm in health promotion efforts, supporting personal involvement in communication interactions, increasing exposure to relevant messages, reducing demands on healthcare staff, improving program efficiency, and minimizing costs. Practice implications: User-centered AI approaches, such as the use of personally involving verbal and nonverbal cues, natural language translation, virtual coaches, and comfortable human-computer interfaces can promote active information processing and adoption of new ideas. Immediacy can improve information access, trust, sharing, motivation, and behavior changes."
23683339,'What matters to Andrew'. The problem of premissary relevance in automated health advisors. Insights from pragma-dialectics,Sara Rubinelli,"Objective: To influence health behavior, communication has to be relevant on an individual level and, thus, fulfill the requirement of premissary relevance. This paper attempts to enrich the design of automated health advisors by, first, reviewing main solutions to the challenge of premissary relevance found in the literature and, second, highlighting the value in this field of the theory of argumentation known as pragma-dialectics. Methods: A conceptual paper grounded in persuasion research and argumentation theory. Results: Automated health advisors enable argumentative exchanges with users. But there is a need to design these systems as to make them work in an audience-centered perspective. The theory of pragma-dialectics can be used to analyze the factors that favor or hinder the agreement of users to engage in certain health behaviors, and to identify argumentation strategies targeted to behavior change. Conclusion: Pragma-dialectics can be used to enhance the design of automated health advisors as it operationalizes the dialogical nature of the reasoning process that can influence health behavior. Practice implications: Premissary relevance is a challenge of communication for health promotion at large that can be promisingly addressed through synergies among persuasion research, argumentation theory and Artificial Intelligence."
23682867,Neurocognition in 1-month-abstinent treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent individuals: interactive effects of age and chronic cigarette smoking,Timothy C Durazzo,"Background: Increasing age and chronic cigarette smoking are independently associated with adverse effects on multiple aspects of neurocognition in those seeking treatment for alcohol use disorders. However, the potential interactive effects of age and cigarette smoking on neurocognition in early abstinent alcohol-dependent individuals (ALC) have not investigated. Methods: Cross-sectional performances of never-smoking healthy comparison participants (nvsCOM; n = 39) and 1-month-abstinent, treatment-seeking, never-smoking (nvsALC; n = 30), former-smoking (fsALC; n = 21), and actively smoking (asALC; n = 68) ALC were compared on a comprehensive neurocognitive battery. Domains of functioning evaluated were cognitive efficiency, executive functions, fine motor skills, general intelligence, learning and memory, processing speed, visuospatial functions and working memory. Participants were between 26 and 71 years of age at the time of assessment. Results: asALC showed steeper age-related effects than nvsCOM on the domains of visuospatial learning, auditory-verbal memory, cognitive efficiency, executive functions, processing speed, and fine motor skills. In pairwise comparisons, fsALC and asALC performed more poorly than both nvsCOM and nvsALC on multiple domains; nvsCOM and nvsALC showed no significant differences. Domain scores for the ALC groups generally fell in the low-to-high-average range of functioning. A clinically significant level of impairment was apparent in only 25% of ALC participants on visuospatial learning, visuospatial memory, and fine motor skills domains. Measures of alcohol use or consumption were not significantly related to neurocognition in the ALC cohorts. Conclusions: The age-related findings suggest that the combination of active chronic smoking and alcohol dependence in this 1-month-abstinent ALC cohort was associated with greater than normal age-related effects in multiple domains. In general, a low level of clinically significant impairment was observed in the alcohol-dependent participants. The findings from this study, in conjunction with previous research, strongly support smoking cessation interventions for those seeking treatment for alcohol and substance use disorders."
23682062,"Emotional intelligence, personality, and gender as factors in disordered eating patterns",Leehu Zysberg,"We examined the hypotheses that proposing higher levels of emotional intelligence (ability test and self-report) and lower neuroticism, extraversion, and agreeableness associate with lower levels of disordered eating. In a correlational study, 126 Israeli college students completed two measures of emotional intelligence, a brief five-factor personality test, demographic data questionnaires, and questionnaires assessing food preoccupation, namely, the Body Weight, Image and Self-Esteem Scale and the Appearance Schema Inventory. Results suggested that ability emotional intelligence is associated with disordered eating beyond gender and personality. Self-reported emotional intelligence did not associate with any of the outcomes after controlling for personality. Implications and applications are briefly discussed."
23681092,An easy to deploy street light control system based on wireless communication and LED technology,Pilar Elejoste,"This paper presents an intelligent streetlight management system based on LED lamps, designed to facilitate its deployment in existing facilities. The proposed approach, which is based on wireless communication technologies, will minimize the cost of investment of traditional wired systems, which always need civil engineering for burying of cable underground and consequently are more expensive than if the connection of the different nodes is made over the air. The deployed solution will be aware of their surrounding's environmental conditions, a fact that will be approached for the system intelligence in order to learn, and later, apply dynamic rules. The knowledge of real time illumination needs, in terms of instant use of the street in which it is installed, will also feed our system, with the objective of providing tangible solutions to reduce energy consumption according to the contextual needs, an exact calculation of energy consumption and reliable mechanisms for preventive maintenance of facilities."
23680941,Perfluorooctanoate and neuropsychological outcomes in children,Cheryl R Stein,"Background: In animal studies, perfluorinated compounds affect fetal growth, development, viability, and postnatal growth. The limited epidemiologic findings on child neurobehavioral development are mixed. Methods: We recruited and evaluated 320 children who participated in the C8 Health Project, a 2005-2006 survey in a Mid-Ohio Valley community highly exposed to perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) through contaminated drinking water. We examined associations among estimated in utero PFOA exposure, measured childhood PFOA serum concentration, and subsequent performance on neuropsychological tests 3-4 years later at ages 6-12 years. We assessed Intelligence Quotient (IQ) reading and math skills, language, memory and learning, visual-spatial processing, and attention. All multivariable linear regression models were adjusted for age, sex, home environment, test examiner, and maternal IQ. Models with measured childhood PFOA were additionally adjusted for child body mass index. Results: Children in the highest as compared with lowest quartile of estimated in utero PFOA had increases in Full Scale IQ (β 4.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.7-8.5) and decreases in characteristics of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder as measured by the Clinical Confidence Index of Connors' Continuous Performance Test-II (β -8.5, 95% CI = -16.1 to -0.8). There were negligible associations between PFOA and reading or math skills or neuropsychological functioning. Conclusion: These results do not suggest an adverse association between the levels of PFOA exposure experienced by children in this cohort and their performance on neuropsychological tests."
23680080,"Epidemiology of uncontrolled epilepsy in the Al-Kharga District, New Valley, Egypt",Wafaa M A Farghaly,"Background: Despite advances in treating epilepsy, uncontrolled epilepsy continues to be a major clinical problem. Therefore, this work aimed to study the epidemiology of uncontrolled epilepsy in Al-Kharga District, New Valley. Methods: This study was carried out in 3 stages via door-to-door screening of the total population (62,583 persons). All suspected cases of epilepsy were subjected to case ascertainment, conventional ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG), and the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale. Patients who had been receiving suitable anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) over the previous 6 months and were having active seizures were considered uncontrolled, according to Ohtsuka et al.(23) The patients underwent serum AED level estimation, video EEG monitoring, and brain MRIs. Fifty age- and gender-matched patients with controlled epilepsy were chosen for statistical analysis and compared with true intractable patients. Results: A total of 437 patients with epilepsy were identified, 30.7% of whom (n=134/437) were uncontrolled, with a prevalence of 2.1/1000. A total of 52.2% of uncontrolled patients (n=70/134) were inappropriately treated, while 47.8% (n=64/134) were compliant with appropriate treatments. Video monitoring EEG of compliant uncontrolled patients demonstrated that 78.1% patients (n=50/64) had definite epilepsy, while 21.9% (n=14/64) had psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). A logistic regression analysis revealed that status epilepticus, focal seizures, and mixed seizure types were risk factors for intractability."
23679649,Causal entropic forces,A D Wissner-Gross,"Recent advances in fields ranging from cosmology to computer science have hinted at a possible deep connection between intelligence and entropy maximization, but no formal physical relationship between them has yet been established. Here, we explicitly propose a first step toward such a relationship in the form of a causal generalization of entropic forces that we find can cause two defining behaviors of the human ""cognitive niche""-tool use and social cooperation-to spontaneously emerge in simple physical systems. Our results suggest a potentially general thermodynamic model of adaptive behavior as a nonequilibrium process in open systems."
23678508,Retinal vessel caliber and lifelong neuropsychological functioning: retinal imaging as an investigative tool for cognitive epidemiology,Idan Shalev,"Why do more intelligent people live healthier and longer lives? One possibility is that intelligence tests assess health of the brain, but psychological science has lacked technology to evaluate this hypothesis. Digital retinal imaging, a new, noninvasive method to visualize microcirculation in the eye, may reflect vascular conditions in the brain. We studied the association between retinal vessel caliber and neuropsychological functioning in the representative Dunedin birth cohort. Wider venular caliber was associated with poorer neuropsychological functioning at midlife, independently of potentially confounding factors. This association was not limited to any specific test domain and extended to informants' reports of cohort members' cognitive difficulties in everyday life. Moreover, wider venular caliber was associated with lower childhood IQ tested 25 years earlier. The findings indicate that retinal venular caliber may be an indicator of neuropsychological health years before the onset of dementing diseases and suggest that digital retinal imaging may be a useful investigative tool for psychological science."
23678339,Cultural Intelligence and Social Adaptability: A Comparison between Iranian and Non-Iranian Dormitory Students of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences,Batoul Soltani,"Introduction: At the modern age, to acquire knowledge and experience, the individuals with their own specific culture have to enter contexts with cultural diversity, adapt to different cultures and have social interactions to be able to have effective inter-cultural relationships.To have such intercultural associations and satisfy individual needs in the society, cultural intelligence and social adaptability are deemed as inevitable requirements, in particular for those who enter a quite different culture. Hence, the present study tries to compare the cultural intelligence and its aspects and social adaptability in Iranian and non-Iranian dormitory students of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in 2012. Methodology: The study was of descriptiveanalytical nature. The research population consisted of Iranian and non-Iranian students resided in the dormitories of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences which are 2500, totally. For Iranian students, two-stage sampling method was adopted. At the first stage, classified sampling and at the second stage, systematic random sampling was conducted. In this way, 441 students were selected. To form non-Iranian students' sample, consensus sampling method was applied and a sample of 37 students were obtained. The research data was collected by using Earley & Ang's Cultural Intelligence Questionnaire with the Cronbach's coefficient α of 76% and California Social Adaptability Standard Questionnaire with the Cronbach's coefficient α of over 70%. Then, the data were put into SPSS software to be analyzed. Finally, the results were presented by descriptive and inferential statistics methods. Results: The study findings revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between cultural intelligence and cognitive aspect of cultural intelligence in Iranian and non-Iranian students (P≥0/05). However, Iranian and non-Iranian students statistically differed in terms of the following aspects of cultural intelligence: meta-cognitive aspect (61.8% for Iranian students vs. 47.6% for non-Iranians), motivational aspect (59.0% vs. 42.6%), behavioral aspect (31.8% vs. 41.2%) as well as social adaptability as the other variable in question ( 68.9% vs. 56.2%) (p<0.001). Conclusion: The comparison of the mean scores gained for meta-cognitive and motivational aspects of cultural intelligence as well as social adaptability in Iranian and non-Iranian students resided in the dormitories of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences revealed that the Iranian students had the higher rank. On the other hand, the mean score acquired for the behavioral aspect in Iranian and non-Iranian students were comparable, with non-Iranian students having the higher mean scores. Therefore, it can be said that the meta-cognitive and motivational aspects of cultural intelligence and social adaptability of non-Iranian students and the behavioral aspect of Iranian students' cultural intelligence may be promoted by educational planning, thereby, taking effective steps towards their achievement in contexts with inter-cultural interaction . In this way, their mental health will be enhanced, as well."
23678245,The embodied embedded character of system 1 processing,Samuel de Castro Bellini-Leite,"In the last thirty years, a relatively large group of cognitive scientists have begun characterising the mind in terms of two distinct, relatively autonomous systems. To account for paradoxes in empirical results of studies mainly on reasoning, Dual Process Theories were developed. Such Dual Process Theories generally agree that System 1 is rapid, automatic, parallel, and heuristic-based and System 2 is slow, capacity-demanding, sequential, and related to consciousness. While System 2 can still be decently understood from a traditional cognitivist approach, I will argue that it is essential for System 1 processing to be comprehended in an Embodied Embedded approach to Cognition."
23678242,Towards an integrative theory of consciousness: part 2 (an anthology of various other models),Avinash De Sousa,"The study of consciousness has today moved beyond neurobiology and cognitive models. In the past few years, there has been a surge of research into various newer areas. The present article looks at the non-neurobiological and non-cognitive theories regarding this complex phenomenon, especially ones that self-psychology, self-theory, artificial intelligence, quantum physics, visual cognitive science and philosophy have to offer. Self-psychology has proposed the need to understand the self and its development, and the ramifications of the self for morality and empathy, which will help us understand consciousness better. There have been inroads made from the fields of computer science, machine technology and artificial intelligence, including robotics, into understanding the consciousness of these machines and their implications for human consciousness. These areas are explored. Visual cortex and emotional theories along with their implications are discussed. The phylogeny and evolution of the phenomenon of consciousness is also highlighted, with theories on the emergence of consciousness in fetal and neonatal life. Quantum physics and its insights into the mind, along with the implications of consciousness and physics and their interface are debated. The role of neurophilosophy to understand human consciousness, the functions of such a concept, embodiment, the dark side of consciousness, future research needs and limitations of a scientific theory of consciousness complete the review. The importance and salient features of each theory are discussed along with certain pitfalls, if present. A need for the integration of various theories to understand consciousness from a holistic perspective is stressed."
23677345,Cooperation creates selection for tactical deception,Luke McNally,"Conditional social behaviours such as partner choice and reciprocity are held to be key mechanisms facilitating the evolution of cooperation, particularly in humans. Although how these mechanisms select for cooperation has been explored extensively, their potential to select simultaneously for complex cheating strategies has been largely overlooked. Tactical deception, the misrepresentation of the state of the world to another individual, may allow cheaters to exploit conditional cooperation by tactically misrepresenting their past actions and/or current intentions. Here we first use a simple game-theoretic model to show that the evolution of cooperation can create selection pressures favouring the evolution of tactical deception. This effect is driven by deception weakening cheater detection in conditional cooperators, allowing tactical deceivers to elicit cooperation at lower costs, while simple cheats are recognized and discriminated against. We then provide support for our theoretical predictions using a comparative analysis of deception across primate species. Our results suggest that the evolution of conditional strategies may, in addition to promoting cooperation, select for astute cheating and associated psychological abilities. Ultimately, our ability to convincingly lie to each other may have evolved as a direct result of our cooperative nature."
23675408,Neural basis of impaired cognitive flexibility in patients with anorexia nervosa,Yasuhiro Sato,"Background: Impaired cognitive flexibility in anorexia nervosa (AN) causes clinical problems and makes the disease hard to treat, but its neural basis has yet to be fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the brain activity of individuals with AN while performing a task requiring cognitive flexibility on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), which is one of the most frequently used neurocognitive measures of cognitive flexibility and problem-solving ability. Methods: Participants were 15 female AN patients and 15 age- and intelligence quotient-matched healthy control women. Participants completed the WCST while their brain activity was measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging during the task. Brain activation in response to set shifting error feedback and the correlation between such brain activity and set shifting performance were analyzed. Results: The correct rate on the WCST was significantly poorer for AN patients than for controls. Patients showed poorer activity in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral parahippocampal cortex on set shifting than controls. Controls showed a positive correlation between correct rate and ventrolateral prefrontal activity in response to set shifting whereas patients did not. Conclusion: These findings suggest dysfunction of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and parahippocampal cortex as a cause of impaired cognitive flexibility in AN patients."
24872983,Directed Evolution for Development and Production of Bioactive Agents: A Meeting Summary,Committee on Science and Technology for Defense Warning,"In 2012, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) approached the National Research Council and asked that a committee be formed to develop a list of workshop topics to explore the impact of emerging science and technology. One topic that came out of that list was directed evolution for development and production of bioactive agents. This workshop was held on February 21-22, 2013. Directed Evolution for Development and Production of Bioactive Agents explains the objectives of the workshop, which were to explore the potential use of directed evolution1 for military science and technology. Understanding the current research in this area, and the potential opportunities for U.S. adversaries to use this research, might allow the DIA to advise U.S. policy makers in an appropriate and timely manner. The workshop featured invited presentations and discussions that aimed to: -Inform the U.S. intelligence community of the current status of directed evolution technology and related research, and -Discuss possible approaches involving directed evolution that might be used by an adversary to develop toxic biological agents that could pose a threat to the United States or its allies, and how they could be identified. Members of the Committee on Science and Technology for Defense Warning planned the agenda for the workshop, selected the presenters, and helped moderate discussions in which meeting participants probed issues of national security related to directed evolution in an effort to gain an understanding of potential vulnerabilities. Experts were invited from the areas of directed evolution, biosynthesis, detection, and biological agents."
23670943,Investigating the effects of repeated Miranda warnings: do they perform a curative function on common Miranda misconceptions?,Richard Rogers,"In Miranda v. Arizona (1966), the Supreme Court of the United States required that custodial suspects be apprised of their Constitutional rights against self-incrimination. The Court could not have anticipated the rampant popularization of Miranda warnings in subsequent movies and television dramas. Influenced by public media, many arrestees assume that they already ""know"" their rights, with no awareness of their misconceptions. The current investigation examines whether repeated exposures to Miranda warnings performs any ""curative"" function (i.e., dispelling common Miranda misconceptions held by pretrial defendants). The accumulative effects of five different Miranda warnings were tested over a several-hour period on 260 detainees. For the nearly half (113 or 43.5%) with three or more misconceptions, improvement (i.e., ≥2 fewer misconceptions) occurred for only 35 defendants. Predictably, this improved group also tended to display a better understanding of Miranda-relevant vocabulary words and a better recall of the administered Miranda warnings than their unimproved counterparts. On average, the improved group also performed better on general measures of intelligence, and listening and reading comprehension, while still evidencing substantial cognitive deficits. The curative function of Miranda advisements is considered in light of these findings."
23670203,Lanthanum chloride impairs spatial learning and memory and downregulates NF-κB signalling pathway in rats,Linlin Zheng,"Exposure to rare earth elements (REEs) is known to impair intelligence in children and cause neurobehavioral abnormalities in animals. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not clear. Lanthanum is often used to study the effects of REEs. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of lanthanum chloride (LaCl3) on spatial learning and memory and a possible underlying mechanism involving nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signalling pathway expression in the hippocampus. The rats were exposed to 0, 0.25, 0.50 or 1.00 % LaCl3 in drinking water during pregnancy and lactation (i.e. while feeding their offspring). After weaning, young rats continued to receive 0, 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 % LaCl3 in the drinking water for 1 month. LaCl3 exposure impaired the spatial learning and memory of young rats and significantly decreased the expression of phosphorylated IκB kinase complex, phosphorylated IκBα, NF-κB, c-fos, c-jun and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the hippocampus. These results indicate that LaCl3 exposure impairs spatial learning and memory in rats by inhibiting NF-κB signalling pathway."
23669711,"FTT-MA: a flexible time-triggered middleware architecture for time sensitive, resource-aware AmI systems",Adrián Noguero,"There is an increasing number of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems that are time-sensitive and resource-aware. From healthcare to building and even home/office automation, it is now common to find systems combining interactive and sensing multimedia traffic with relatively simple sensors and actuators (door locks, presence detectors, RFIDs, HVAC, information panels, etc.). Many of these are today known as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Quite frequently, these systems must be capable of (1) prioritizing different traffic flows (process data, alarms, non-critical data, etc.), (2) synchronizing actions in several distributed devices and, to certain degree, (3) easing resource management (e.g., detecting faulty nodes, managing battery levels, handling overloads, etc.). This work presents FTT-MA, a high-level middleware architecture aimed at easing the design, deployment and operation of such AmI systems. FTT-MA ensures that both functional and non-functional aspects of the applications are met even during reconfiguration stages. The paper also proposes a methodology, together with a design tool, to create this kind of systems. Finally, a sample case study is presented that illustrates the use of the middleware and the methodology proposed in the paper."
23667475,A multi-platform draft de novo genome assembly and comparative analysis for the Scarlet Macaw (Ara macao),Christopher M Seabury,"Data deposition to NCBI Genomes: This Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession AMXX00000000 (SMACv1.0, unscaffolded genome assembly). The version described in this paper is the first version (AMXX01000000). The scaffolded assembly (SMACv1.1) has been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under the accession AOUJ00000000, and is also the first version (AOUJ01000000). Strong biological interest in traits such as the acquisition and utilization of speech, cognitive abilities, and longevity catalyzed the utilization of two next-generation sequencing platforms to provide the first-draft de novo genome assembly for the large, new world parrot Ara macao (Scarlet Macaw). Despite the challenges associated with genome assembly for an outbred avian species, including 951,507 high-quality putative single nucleotide polymorphisms, the final genome assembly (>1.035 Gb) includes more than 997 Mb of unambiguous sequence data (excluding N's). Cytogenetic analyses including ZooFISH revealed complex rearrangements associated with two scarlet macaw macrochromosomes (AMA6, AMA7), which supports the hypothesis that translocations, fusions, and intragenomic rearrangements are key factors associated with karyotype evolution among parrots. In silico annotation of the scarlet macaw genome provided robust evidence for 14,405 nuclear gene annotation models, their predicted transcripts and proteins, and a complete mitochondrial genome. Comparative analyses involving the scarlet macaw, chicken, and zebra finch genomes revealed high levels of nucleotide-based conservation as well as evidence for overall genome stability among the three highly divergent species. Application of a new whole-genome analysis of divergence involving all three species yielded prioritized candidate genes and noncoding regions for parrot traits of interest (i.e., speech, intelligence, longevity) which were independently supported by the results of previous human GWAS studies. We also observed evidence for genes and noncoding loci that displayed extreme conservation across the three avian lineages, thereby reflecting their likely biological and developmental importance among birds."
23667162,Life-course pathways to psychological distress: a cohort study,Sophie von Stumm,"Objectives: Early life factors, like intelligence and socioeconomic status (SES), are associated with health outcomes in adulthood. Fitting comprehensive life-course models, we tested (1) the effect of childhood intelligence and SES, education and adulthood SES on psychological distress at midlife, and (2) compared alternative measurement specifications (reflective and formative) of SES. Design: Prospective cohort study (the Aberdeen Children of the 1950s). Setting: Aberdeen, Scotland. Participants: 12 500 live-births (6282 boys) between 1950 and 1956, who were followed up in the years 2001-2003 at age 46-51 with a postal questionnaire achieving a response rate of 64% (7183). Outcome measures: Psychological distress at age 46-51 (questionnaire). Results: Childhood intelligence and SES and education had indirect effects on psychological distress at midlife, mediated by adult SES. Adult SES was the only variable to have a significant direct effect on psychological distress at midlife; the effect was stronger in men than in women. Alternative measurement specifications of SES (reflective and formative) resulted in greatly different model parameters and fits. Conclusions: Even though formative operationalisations of SES are theoretically appropriate, SES is better specified as reflective than as a formative latent variable in the context of life-course modelling."
23667158,"Cognitive and motor skills in school-aged children following maternal vitamin A supplementation during pregnancy in rural Nepal: a follow-up of a placebo-controlled, randomised cohort",Gillian J Buckley,"Objective: To determine the effects of maternal vitamin A supplementation from preconception through postpartum on cognitive and motor development of children at 10-13 years of age in rural Nepal. Design: Follow-up assessment of children born to women randomly assigned by a village to receive either supplemental vitamin A (7000 µg retinol equivalents) or placebo weekly during a continuous 3.5-year period from 1994-1997. The participants came from 12 wards, a subset of 270 wards in the original trial. Trained staff tested children for cognition by the Universal Nonverbal Intelligence Test (UNIT) and motor ability using four subtests from the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC). Data on schooling, home environment and nutritional and socioeconomic status were also collected. Setting: Southern plains district of Sarlahi, Nepal. Participants: 390 Nepalese children 10-13 years of age. Main outcome measures: Raw scores on UNIT and square-root transformed scores on an abridged version of the MABC tests, expressed as cluster-summarised (mean±SD) values to account for the design of the original trial. Results: There were no differences in UNIT (79.61±5.99 vs 80.69±6.71) or MABC (2.64±0.07 vs 2.49±0.09) test scores in children whose mothers were exposed to vitamin A vs placebo (mean differences: -1.07, 95% CI -7.10 to 9.26, p=0.78; 0.15, 95% CI 0.43 to -0.08, p=0.15), respectively. More children in the placebo group had repeated a grade in school (28% of placebo vs 16.7% of vitamin A, p=0.01). Conclusions: Preconceptional to postpartum maternal vitamin A supplementation, in an undernourished setting, does not improve cognition or motor development at ages 10-13 years."
23667120,Cognitive function related to temporal lobe epilepsy: advances in research on new cognitive function],Mitsuhiko Yamano,"The importance of neuropsychological examinations in epilepsy care and, especially, in epilepsy surgery is centered on the following roles: they offer a means to confirm the epileptic focus by multi-modal preoperative assessments and they help to assess postoperative functional changes based on preoperative cognitive functions. Furthermore, assessments of the cognitive functions of patients with epilepsy using various tests aid in providing comprehensive medical care. Thus far, research on cognitive functions related to temporal lobe epilepsy has focused on memory, language, and general intelligence. However, the concept of social cognitive function has been recently proposed in the field of neuropsychology. This cognitive function, proposed by Brothers in 1990, is a collective term for functions needed in social life; these include functions required to interpret the expressions, feelings, and intentions of others and to form and maintain smooth human relationships while making decisions necessary for self-survival. These functions mainly involve facial expression recognition and decision-making. Findings of research on neural mechanisms underlying social cognitive functions have emphasized the roles of the cerebral limbic system, such as the amygdalo-hippocampal complexes, and the emotional system in the ventromedial prefrontal area. Studies on social cognitive functions in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy are being pursued currently. Early-onset right mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis is the key substrate determining a severe deficit in recognizing emotional facial expressions and decision-making. In the future, neuropsychological examinations of social cognition, in addition to those of global intelligence, memory, and verbal function, will contribute to the provision of comprehensive medical care to patients with epilepsy."
23666847,I-CAN: the classification and prediction of support needs,Samuel R C Arnold,"Background: Since 1992, the diagnosis and classification of intellectual disability has been dependent upon three constructs: intelligence, adaptive behaviour and support needs (Luckasson et al. 1992. Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification and Systems of Support. American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disability, Washington, DC). While the methods and instruments to measure intelligence and adaptive behaviour are well established and generally accepted, the measurement and classification of support needs is still in its infancy. This article explores the measurement and classification of support needs. Method: A study is presented comparing scores on the ICF (WHO, 2001) based I-CAN v4.2 support needs assessment and planning tool with expert clinical judgment using a proposed classification of support needs. A logical classification algorithm was developed and validated on a separate sample. Results: Good internal consistency (range 0.73-0.91, N = 186) and criterion validity (κ = 0.94, n = 49) were found. Conclusions: Further advances in our understanding and measurement of support needs could change the way we assess, describe and classify disability."
23666503,Role of visual integration in gaze perception and emotional intelligence in schizophrenia,Ivy F Tso,"Background: Individuals with schizophrenia demonstrate a wide range of social cognitive deficits that significantly compromise functioning. Early visual processing is frequently disrupted in schizophrenia, and growing evidence suggests a role of perceptual dysfunctions in socioemotional functioning in the disorder. This study examined visual integration (the ability to effectively integrate individual, local visual features into a holistic representation), a target construct of basic perception identified by the Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia initiative, and its relationship with eye- contact perception and emotional intelligence in schizophrenia. Methods: Twenty-nine participants with schizophrenia (SCZ) and 23 healthy controls (HC) completed tasks measuring visual integration (Coherent Motion Task, Contour Integration Task), an eye-contact perception task, and a measure of emotional intelligence. Results: SCZ participants showed compromised visual integration as suggested by poorer performance on the Contour Integration Task relative to HC. Visual integration was a significant predictor of eye-contact perception and emotional intelligence among SCZ. The amounts of variances in these 2 social cognitive areas accounted for by visual integration were comparable to and overlapped with those accounted for by the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Conclusions: Individuals with schizophrenia showed compromised visual integration, and this may play a significant role in the observed deficits in higher level processing of social information in the disorder."
23666039,Autism and dietary therapy: case report and review of the literature,Martha R Herbert,"We report the history of a child with autism and epilepsy who, after limited response to other interventions following her regression into autism, was placed on a gluten-free, casein-free diet, after which she showed marked improvement in autistic and medical symptoms. Subsequently, following pubertal onset of seizures and after failing to achieve full seizure control pharmacologically she was advanced to a ketogenic diet that was customized to continue the gluten-free, casein-free regimen. On this diet, while still continuing on anticonvulsants, she showed significant improvement in seizure activity. This gluten-free casein-free ketogenic diet used medium-chain triglycerides rather than butter and cream as its primary source of fat. Medium-chain triglycerides are known to be highly ketogenic, and this allowed the use of a lower ratio (1.5:1) leaving more calories available for consumption of vegetables with their associated health benefits. Secondary benefits included resolution of morbid obesity and improvement of cognitive and behavioral features. Over the course of several years following her initial diagnosis, the child's Childhood Autism Rating Scale score decreased from 49 to 17, representing a change from severe autism to nonautistic, and her intelligence quotient increased 70 points. The initial electroencephalogram after seizure onset showed lengthy 3 Hz spike-wave activity; 14 months after the initiation of the diet the child was essentially seizure free and the electroencephalogram showed only occasional 1-1.5 second spike-wave activity without clinical accompaniments."
23665430,The validation of a scale to measure cognitive development in Chinese preschool children,Cynthia Leung,"The present study aimed to evaluate the reliability and validity of the cognitive sub-test of the Preschool Developmental Assessment Scale (PDAS) for Hong Kong Chinese children. Participants included 378 children (189 boys and 189 girls) aged 3-6 years old, with 324 children with typical development and 54 children with developmental disabilities. They were administered the cognitive sub-test of the PDAS and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Revised (WPPSI-R). The PDAS cognitive sub-test total scores correlated positively with the WPPSI-R scores. It could differentiate children from different age groups, with younger children attaining significantly lower scores than older children. The sub-test could also differentiate children with typical development from those with developmental disabilities, with the latter attaining significantly lower scores. The sensitivity and specificity were around 80%. Internal consistency (KR-20) was .93 and test-retest reliability was .81. The cognitive sub-test of the PDAS was found to be a promising screening tool for the identification of preschool children with developmental disabilities."
23664590,General intellectual ability does not explain the general deficit in schizophrenia,Bradley E Gray,"Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate a generalized deficit across multiple cognitive domains. However, it is unknown whether this deficit is largely due to lower intelligence, or if there is an impact of schizophrenia which cannot be accounted for by measures of general intellectual ability (GIA). We created four IQ-matched strata of equal width between 89 healthy volunteers (HC) and 77 patients with schizophrenia (SZ) who had very similar IQ and reading scores within each stratum, then compared each stratum's performance on the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). We hypothesized that any patient impairment on the MCCB after matching on IQ would be evidence that GIA does not fully explain the general deficit seen in schizophrenia. We found that patients showed evidence of greater neuropsychological impairment than what would be expected based solely on their IQ and reading ability scores. Further, this deficit was stronger in some cognitive domains than others, namely, processing speed and social cognition. These results suggest the presence of a distinction between GIA and generalized neuropsychological impairment that was consistent in magnitude across all patients, regardless of IQ."
23664232,Communicating risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer with an interactive decision support tool,Douglas J Rupert,"Objective: Women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) face a higher risk of earlier, more aggressive cancer. Because of HBOC's rarity, screening is recommended only for women with strong cancer family histories. However, most patients do not have accurate history available and struggle to understand genetic concepts. Methods: Cancer in the Family, an online clinical decision support tool, calculated women's HBOC risk and promoted shared patient-provider decisions about screening. A pilot evaluation (n=9 providers, n=48 patients) assessed the tool's impact on knowledge, attitudes, and screening decisions. Patients used the tool before wellness exams and completed three surveys. Providers accessed the tool during exams, completed exam checklists, and completed four surveys. Results: Patients entered complete family histories (67%), calculated personal risk (96%), and shared risk printouts with providers (65%). HBOC knowledge increased dramatically for patients and providers, and many patients (75%) perceived tool results as valid. The tool prompted patient-provider discussions about HBOC risk and cancer family history (88%). Conclusions: The tool was effective in increasing knowledge, collecting family history, and sparking patient-provider discussions about HBOC screening. Practice implications: Interactive tools can effectively communicate personalized risk and promote shared decisions, but they are not a substitute for patient-provider discussions."
23663916,What else can brains do?,Aaron Sloman,"The approach Clark labels ""action-oriented predictive processing"" treats all cognition as part of a system of on-line control. This ignores other important aspects of animal, human, and robot intelligence. He contrasts it with an alleged ""mainstream"" approach that also ignores the depth and variety of AI/Robotic research. I don't think the theory presented is worth taking seriously as a complete model, even if there is much that it explains."
23663552,Affect and non-uniform characteristics of predictive processing in musical behaviour,Rebecca S Schaefer,"The important roles of prediction and prior experience are well established in music research and fit well with Clark's concept of unified perception, cognition, and action arising from hierarchical, bidirectional predictive processing. However, in order to fully account for human musical intelligence, Clark needs to further consider the powerful and variable role of affect in relation to prediction error."
23663382,Identifying a consistent pattern of neural function in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a meta-analysis,H McCarthy,"Background: The neurobiological underpinnings of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are inconclusive. Activation abnormalities across brain regions in ADHD compared with healthy controls highlighted in task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are heterogeneous. To identify a consistent pattern of neural dysfunction in ADHD, a meta-analysis of fMRI studies using Go/no-go, Stop and N-back tasks was undertaken. Method: Several databases were searched using the key words: 'ADHD and fMRI' and 'ADHD and fMRI task'. In all, 20 studies met inclusion criteria comprising 334 patients with ADHD and 372 healthy controls and were split into N-back, Stop task and Go/no-go case-control groups. Using Signed Differential Mapping each batch was meta-analysed individually and meta-regression analyses were used to examine the effects of exposure to methylphenidate (MPH), length of MPH wash-out period, ADHD subtype, age and intelligence quotient (IQ) differences upon neural dysfunction in ADHD. Results: Across all tasks less activity in frontal lobe regions compared with controls was detected. Less exposure to treatment and lengthier wash-out times resulted in less left medial frontal cortex activation in N-back and Go/no-go studies. Higher percentage of combined-type ADHD resulted in less superior and inferior frontal gyrus activation. Different IQ scores between groups were linked to reduced right caudate activity in ADHD. Conclusions: Consistent frontal deficits imply homogeneous cognitive strategies involved in ADHD behavioural control. Our findings suggest a link between fMRI results and the potentially normalizing effect of treatment and signify a need for segregated examination and contrast of differences in sample characteristics in future studies."
23663048,Influence of IQ in interpreting MMSE scores in patients with multiple sclerosis,Samuel T Gontkovsky,"The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) were administered to 46 outpatients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). MMSE total raw score was significantly and positively correlated with all WAIS-IV indexes, even when controlling for the effects of participant educational level, with the strongest relationship being with Full Scale IQ. These results suggest that clinicians consider patient intellectual functioning, in particular Full Scale IQ, when diagnosing neurocognitive impairment based on screening with the MMSE in individuals with MS."
23662850,Intelligence assessments for children with cerebral palsy: a systematic review,Rebecca Yin Foo,"Aim: Cerebral palsy (CP) is defined as a primary disorder of posture and movement; however, approximately 45% of children with CP also have an intellectual impairment. Prevalence estimates are limited by a lack of guidelines for intelligence testing. This systematic review aims to identify and examine intelligence assessments for children with CP. Method: Electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, EMBASE, and ERIC) were searched to identify assessments that (1) measured intellectual function, (2) in children aged 4 to 18 years, (3) with CP, and (4) with psychometrics available. Results: Searches yielded 48 assessments, of which nine provided psychometric data for children with CP. The included tests were the Columbia Mental Maturity Scale, the Leiter International Performance Scale, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, the Pictorial Test of Intelligence, the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices, the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. Interpretation: Intelligence assessments in children with CP lack reliability data, consensus regarding validity data, and population-specific norms. Research is required to establish psychometrics for children with CP. For children with higher motor involvement and/or communication and/or visual impairments, multiple options are required to assess intelligence appropriately."
23660239,Emotional intelligence: an admission criterion alternative to cumulative grade point averages for prelicensure students,Jan Jones-Schenk,"Background: Predicting potential student success is of great interest to nursing educators and academic administrators alike. Cumulative grade point average (CGPA) has traditionally been used to screen nursing program candidates, but CGPA itself has shown to have no statistically significant predictive value and may in fact screen out individuals who possess social intelligence attributes that are essential for success in nursing practice. The purpose of this study is to determine if students whose emotional intelligence characteristics meet or exceed those of successful staff nurses are more likely to be successful in a baccalaureate nursing program. Methods: A descriptive, correlational design was used to compare the emotional intelligence attributes of 116 potential nursing students and 42 successful staff nurses using the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i). Results: Nursing students who remained in the nursing program were found to have significantly higher levels of total emotional intelligence, interpersonal capacity, and stress tolerance. Students who dropped from the nursing program were not significantly different from successful staff nurses in terms of emotional intelligence. Conclusion: Emotional intelligence presents a compelling adjunct to current selection criteria for nursing students. However, the lack of research prevents widespread adoption of this criterion. This study suggests that students with higher levels of emotional intelligence, particularly intrapersonal capacity and stress tolerance, are more likely to be successful in a baccalaureate nursing program than students with lower levels. Further research is needed to determine the usefulness of EI as a predictor of student success in nursing programs."
23658933,Beyond the ridge pattern: multi-informative analysis of latent fingermarks by MALDI mass spectrometry,S Francese,"After over a century, fingerprints are still one of the most powerful means of biometric identification. The conventional forensic workflow for suspect identification consists of (i) recovering latent marks from crime scenes using the appropriate enhancement technique and (ii) obtaining an image of the mark to compare either against known suspect prints and/or to search in a Fingerprint Database. The suspect is identified through matching the ridge pattern and local characteristics of the ridge pattern (minutiae). However successful, there are a number of scenarios in which this process may fail; they include the recovery of partial, distorted or smudged marks, poor quality of the image resulting from inadequacy of the enhancement technique applied, extensive scarring/abrasion of the fingertips or absence of suspect's fingerprint records in the database. In all of these instances it would be very desirable to have a technology able to provide additional information from a fingermark exploiting its endogenous and exogenous chemical content. This opportunity could potentially provide new investigative leads, especially when the fingermark comparison and match process fails. We have demonstrated that Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry and Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI MSI) can provide multiple images of the same fingermark in one analysis simultaneous with additional intelligence. Here, a review on the pioneering use and development of MALDI MSI for the analysis of latent fingermarks is presented along with the latest achievements on the forensic intelligence retrievable."
23657672,Cognitive ability correlates positively with son birth and predicts cross-cultural variation of the offspring sex ratio,Madhukar Shivajirao Dama,"Human populations show remarkable variation in the sex ratio at birth which is believed to be related to the parental condition. In the present study, the global variation of sex ratio at birth (SRB, proportion of male offspring born) was analyzed with respect to indirect measure of condition, the intelligence quotient (IQ). IQ correlates strongly with lifespan across nations, which makes it a good indicator of health of the large populations. Relation between three standard measures of average national IQ and SRB was studied using multiple linear regression models. Average national IQ was positively correlated with SRB (r = 0.54 to 0.57, p < 0.001). Further, IQ emerged as a powerful predictor of SRB after controlling for the effects of all the known covariates like fertility, maternal age, polygyny prevalence, wealth, son preference, latitude, low birth weight, and neonatal mortality in the regression models. These results suggest that the striking variation of offspring sex ratio across nations could be caused in part by the difference in general condition of populations."
23656355,Normal variability of children's scaled scores on subtests of the Dutch Wechsler Preschool and Primary scale of Intelligence - third edition,P P M Hurks,"Intelligence tests are included in millions of assessments of children and adults each year (Watkins, Glutting, & Lei, 2007a , Applied Neuropsychology, 14, 13). Clinicians often interpret large amounts of subtest scatter, or large differences between the highest and lowest scaled subtest scores, on an intelligence test battery as an index for abnormality or cognitive impairment. The purpose of the present study is to characterize ""normal"" patterns of variability among subtests of the Dutch Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Third Edition (WPPSI-III-NL; Wechsler, 2010 ). Therefore, the frequencies of WPPSI-III-NL scaled subtest scatter were reported for 1039 healthy children aged 4:0-7:11 years. Results indicated that large differences between highest and lowest scaled subtest scores (or subtest scatter) were common in this sample. Furthermore, degree of subtest scatter was related to: (a) the magnitude of the highest scaled subtest score, i.e., more scatter was seen in children with the highest WPPSI-III-NL scaled subtest scores, (b) Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) scores, i.e., higher FSIQ scores were associated with an increase in subtest scatter, and (c) sex differences, with boys showing a tendency to display more scatter than girls. In conclusion, viewing subtest scatter as an index for abnormality in WPPSI-III-NL scores is an oversimplification as this fails to recognize disparate subtest heterogeneity that occurs within a population of healthy children aged 4:0-7:11 years."
23654099,Influence of phthalates from Shaying river on children's intelligence and secretion of thyroid hormone],Anqi Li,"Objective: To investigate the effect of phthalates exposure from drinking water on children's intelligence and secretion of thyroid hormone. Methods: Two villages in S County were selected randomly as polluted area and control area according to the distance from the Shaying river basin. Phthalates including DEP, DBP, DMP, DEHP were measured both in the river water and drinking water using HPLC method. Children aged 8 to 13 years old studying in the village primary school were recruited by cluster sampling (n = 154). The combined Reven Test was used to test children intelligence and ELISA method was used to determined thyroid hormone levels. Results: The concentrations of phthalates (DEP, DBP) were exceeding standards of surface water quality in any of the three sections of the river. Compared to the control area, the concentration of DEP and DBP in drinking water were significant higher in the polluted area than that in control area (P < 0.05). Children from polluted area had significant higher FT4 concentration compared to children from control area (P < 0.05). Intelligence level in children from polluted area was lower than that from control area (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The drinking water has been polluted by Shaying river and thyroid hormones levels of children were affected in the polluted areas. It is necessary to verify if this change is related to the phthalates."
23651471,Parenting styles and emotional intelligence of HIV-affected children in Thailand,Sung-Jae Lee,"The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of parenting styles on emotional intelligence of HIV-affected children in Thailand. This study uses data from 205 HIV-affected children in northern and northeastern Thailand. Correlation and regression analyses were used to examine the predictors of emotional intelligence. Children reporting higher levels of stress reported less caring parenting style (standardized beta [B]=-0.18, p=0.050). Children with higher self-esteem were also more likely to perceive their parents as caring (B=0.48, p=0.002). Children who scored lower on their self-esteem reported their parents to be more overprotective (B=-0.30, p=0.030), and children reporting higher levels of stress reported their parents to be more overprotective (B=0.12, p=0.010). Children reporting caring parenting style were significantly more likely to report higher emotional intelligence (B=0.66, p=0.001). Parenting styles play an important role in the emotional intelligence. Identifying and testing interventions to help parents improve their parenting styles, while helping their HIV-affected children cope with stress and self-esteem, are essential in promoting mental health of HIV-affected children in Thailand."
23650911,Abnormal white matter correlates with neuropsychological impairment in children with localization-related epilepsy,Elysa Widjaja,"Purpose: The white matter (WM) is considered critical for linking cortical processing networks necessary for cognition. The aim of this study was to assess diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of regional WM in children with nonlesional localization-related epilepsy in comparison to controls, and to determine the relation between lobar WM and neuropsychological performance. Methods: Forty children with nonlesional localization-related epilepsy and 25 healthy controls with no neurological or psychiatric disorders and normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were recruited. All patients and controls underwent neuropsychological testing that evaluated intelligence, language, memory, executive function, and motor function, as well as DTI to assess regional WM measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). The regional FA and MD were compared between patients and controls, and correlated with neuropsychological function. The relations between regional FA and MD with age at seizure onset and duration of epilepsy were assessed. Key findings: Twenty-one patients had left-sided and 19 patients had right-sided epilepsy. There were no significant differences in seizure-related variables including age at seizure onset, duration of epilepsy, seizure frequency, and number of antiepileptic medications, as well as no significant differences in neuropsychological function and DTI measures of white matter in left-sided compared to right-sided epilepsy. Therefore, all the patients with epilepsy were treated as one group. Patients with epilepsy performed significantly worse on intelligence (p < 0.001), language (p < 0.001), and executive function (p = 0.001) evaluation than controls. Patients had significantly reduced FA in left frontal (p = 0.015), right frontal (p = 0.004), left temporal (p = 0.039), right temporal (p = 0.003), right parietal (p = 0.014), and right occipital (p = 0.025) WM relative to controls. There were no significant regional WM differences (all p > 0.05) in MD between patients and controls. There was a significant positive correlation between right temporal FA with language (r = 0.535, p < 0.001) and executive function (r = 0.617, p < 0.001), as well as between body of corpus callosum FA with intelligence (r = 0.536, p < 0.001) and language (r = 0.529, p < 0.001) in patients. Left parietal MD was significantly correlated with language (r = -0.545, p < 0.001) in patients. FA of right temporal WM was significantly associated with age at seizure onset (t = 4.97, p < 0.001). Significance: There was widespread regional WM abnormality in children with nonlesional localization-related epilepsy, which was associated with impaired neuropsychological function. The impairment in WM may reflect disruption in the connectivity for cortical processing networks, which is necessary for the development of cognition."
23648867,Biomimetics on seed dispersal: survey and insights for space exploration,Camilla Pandolfi,"Seeds provide the vital genetic link and dispersal agent between successive generations of plants. Without seed dispersal as a means of reproduction, many plants would quickly die out. Because plants lack any sort of mobility and remain in the same spot for their entire lives, they rely on seed dispersal to transport their offspring throughout the environment. This can be accomplished either collectively or individually; in any case as seeds ultimately abdicate their movement, they are at the mercy of environmental factors. Thus, seed dispersal strategies are characterized by robustness, adaptability, intelligence (both behavioral and morphological), and mass and energy efficiency (including the ability to utilize environmental sources of energy available): all qualities that advanced engineering systems aim at in general, and in particular those that need to enable complex endeavors such as space exploration. Plants evolved and adapted their strategy according to their environment, and taken together, they enclose many desirable characteristics that a space mission needs to have. Understanding in detail how plants control the development of seeds, fabricate structural components for their dispersal, build molecular machineries to keep seeds dormant up to the right moment and monitor the environment to release them at the right time could provide several solutions impacting current space mission design practices. It can lead to miniaturization, higher integration and packing efficiency, energy efficiency and higher autonomy and robustness. Consequently, there would appear to be good reasons for considering biomimetic solutions from plant kingdom when designing space missions, especially to other celestial bodies, where solid and liquid surfaces, atmosphere, etc constitute and are obviously parallel with the terrestrial environment where plants evolved. In this paper, we review the current state of biomimetics on seed dispersal to improve space mission design."
23647042,Incremental criterion validity of WAIS-IV factor index scores: relationships with WIAT-II and WIAT-III subtest and composite scores,Gary L Canivez,"The present study examined the incremental validity of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-4th Edition (WAIS-IV; Wechsler, 2008a) factor index scores in predicting academic achievement on the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-2nd Edition (WIAT-II; Psychological Corporation, 2002a) and on the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-3rd Edition (WIAT-III; Wechsler, 2009a) beyond that predicted by the WAIS-IV Full Scale IQ (FSIQ). As with previous intelligence test incremental validity studies, the WAIS-IV FSIQ accounted for statistically significant and generally large portions of WIAT-II and WIAT-III subtest and composite score variance. WAIS-IV factor index scores combined to provide statistically significant increments in variance accounted for in most WIAT-II and WIAT-III subtest and composite scores over and above the FSIQ score; however, the effect sizes ranged from trivial to medium as observed in investigations with other intelligence tests (i.e., Glutting, Watkins, Konold, & McDermott, 2006; Youngstrom, Kogos, & Glutting, 1999). Individually, the WAIS-IV factor index scores provided trivial to small unique contributions to predicting WIAT-II and WIAT-III scores. This finding indicated that the FSIQ should retain primacy and greatest interpretive weight in WAIS-IV interpretation, as previously indicated by WAIS-IV subtest variance partitions form hierarchical exploratory factor analyses (Canivez & Watkins, 2010a, 2012b)."
23644855,"Zinc, vitamin A, and glutamine supplementation in Brazilian shantytown children at risk for diarrhea results in sex-specific improvements in verbal learning",Aldo A M Lima,"Objective: To identify the impact of supplemental zinc, vitamin A, and glutamine, alone or in combination, on long-term cognitive outcomes among Brazilian shantytown children with low median height-for-age z-scores. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in children aged three months to nine years old from the urban shanty compound community of Fortaleza, Brazil. Demographic and anthropometric information was assessed. The random treatment groups available for cognitive testing (total of 167 children) were: (1) placebo, n = 25; (2) glutamine, n = 23; (3) zinc, n = 18; (4) vitamin A, n = 19; (5) glutamine+zinc, n = 20; (6) glutamine+vitamin A, n = 21; (7) zinc+vitamin A, n = 23; and (8) glutamine+zinc+vitamin A, n = 18. Neuropsychological tests were administered for the cognitive domains of non-verbal intelligence and abstraction, psychomotor speed, verbal memory and recall ability, and semantic and phonetic verbal fluency. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 16.0. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00133406. Results: Girls receiving a combination of glutamine, zinc, and vitamin A had higher mean age-adjusted verbal learning scores than girls receiving only placebo (9.5 versus 6.4, p = 0.007) and girls receiving zinc+vitamin A (9.5 versus 6.5, p = 0.006). Similar group differences were not found between male study children. Conclusions: The findings suggest that combination therapy offers a sex-specific advantage on tests of verbal learning, similar to that seen among female patients following traumatic brain injury."
23644537,The neuroanatomical phenotype of tuberous sclerosis complex: focus on radial migration lines,Agnies M van Eeghen,"Introduction: The contribution of radial migration lines (RMLs) to the neuroanatomical and neurocognitive phenotype of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is unclear. The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evaluation of the neuroradiological phenotype of TSC, distinguishing RMLs from normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging. Methods: Magnetic resonance images of 30 patients with TSC were evaluated. The frequencies of RMLs, tubers, and subependymal nodules (SENs) were determined for every hemispheric lobe. Cerebellar lesions and subependymal giant cell tumors were counted. DTI metrics were obtained from the NAWM of every hemispheric lobe and from the largest RML and tuber. Analyses of variance and correlations were performed to investigate the associations between neuroanatomical characteristics and relationships between RML frequency and neurocognitive outcomes. NAWM DTI metrics were compared with measurements of 16 control patients. Results: A mean of 47 RMLs, 27 tubers, and 10 SENs were found per patient, and the frequencies of these lesions were strongly correlated (p < 0.001). RML fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were strongly inversely correlated (p = 0.003). NAWM DTI metrics were similar to the controls (p = 0.26). RML frequency was strongly associated with age of seizure onset (p = 0.003), intelligence outcomes (p = 0.01), and level of autistic features (p = 0.007). Conclusion: A detailed neuroradiological phenotype is presented, showing that RMLs are the most frequent neuroanatomical lesion, are responsible for white matter DTI abnormalities, and are strongly associated with age of seizure onset, intelligence outcomes, and level of autistic features."
23644316,Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and spinal cord involvement in Chinese Han population: a case report and literature review,Fu-Bo Cheng,"Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation (LBSL) is a recently described disorder with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. We report a case of rare adult-onset LBSL with typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features. The DARS2 gene mutation analysis has identified a c. 228-20_21delTTinsC (p.R76SfsX5) mutation and a c. 850G > A (p. 284E > K) mutation. With glucocorticosteroid treatment the patient has had improvement in bladder symptoms. This is the first reported adult-onset LBSL case in the Chinese Han population. A review of the literature suggests that brain lactate elevation in adult-onset LBSL is lower than early-onset cases (P < 0.01), and early-onset cases show mild intelligence and cognition decline. These observations suggest that age of onset and brain lactate levels probably influence the prognosis of LBSL."
23643979,Prediction for human intelligence using morphometric characteristics of cortical surface: partial least square analysis,J-J Yang,"A number of imaging studies have reported neuroanatomical correlates of human intelligence with various morphological characteristics of the cerebral cortex. However, it is not yet clear whether these morphological properties of the cerebral cortex account for human intelligence. We assumed that the complex structure of the cerebral cortex could be explained effectively considering cortical thickness, surface area, sulcal depth and absolute mean curvature together. In 78 young healthy adults (age range: 17-27, male/female: 39/39), we used the full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) and the cortical measurements calculated in native space from each subject to determine how much combining various cortical measures explained human intelligence. Since each cortical measure is thought to be not independent but highly inter-related, we applied partial least square (PLS) regression, which is one of the most promising multivariate analysis approaches, to overcome multicollinearity among cortical measures. Our results showed that 30% of FSIQ was explained by the first latent variable extracted from PLS regression analysis. Although it is difficult to relate the first derived latent variable with specific anatomy, we found that cortical thickness measures had a substantial impact on the PLS model supporting the most significant factor accounting for FSIQ. Our results presented here strongly suggest that the new predictor combining different morphometric properties of complex cortical structure is well suited for predicting human intelligence."
23643773,The SWedish Eating Assessment for Autism spectrum disorders (SWEAA)-Validation of a self-report questionnaire targeting eating disturbances within the autism spectrum,Louise Karlsson,"The aim was to design and validate a questionnaire pertaining to eating problems in individuals with normal intelligence, within the autism spectrum. The questionnaire was based on literature search and clinical experience. The validation focused on psychometric properties of reliability and validity using a clinical group of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (n=57) and a matched, healthy comparison group (n=31). The instrument showed high levels of reliability, convergent and discriminant validity and scaling properties. Logistic regression analyses discerned the single item Simultaneous capacity and the subscale Social situation at mealtime as the best predictors of ASD. In conclusion, the questionnaire is valid and reliable to detect disturbed eating behaviours in individuals with ASD and normal intelligence."

23640936,KCNJ11 in-frame 15-bp deletion leading to glibenclamide- responsive neonatal diabetes mellitus in a Chinese child,Wenli Yang,"The ATP-sensitive K+ channel controls insulin secretion from the islet. Mutations in KCNJ11 can cause permanent and transient neonatal diabetes. To date, more than 30 KCNJ11 mutations have been revealed as related to the onset of neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), most of which are responsive to glibenclamide treatment. In the present study, we sequenced the KCNJ11 gene in a Chinese girl diagnosed with NDM and in her parents. An in-frame 15-bp KCNJ11 deletion was identified in the patient, whereas no KCNJ11 deletions were found in her parents, indicating that this deletion was de novo. The patient was responsive to the treatment of glibenclamide. Ten months of follow-up showed that, besides permanent NDM, the motor and intelligence development of the girl was normal and she suffered no onset of convulsions. The result, to some degree, improved our knowledge on NDM."
23640285,What specific facets of executive function are associated with academic functioning in youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder?,Joshua M Langberg,"The purpose of the study was to evaluate the relation between ratings of Executive Function (EF) and academic functioning in a sample of 94 middle-school-aged youth with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; Mage = 11.9; 78 % male; 21 % minority). This study builds on prior work by evaluating associations between multiple specific aspects of EF (e.g., working memory, inhibition, and planning and organization) as rated by both parents and teachers on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), with multiple academic outcomes, including school grades and homework problems. Further, this study examined the relationship between EF and academic outcomes above and beyond ADHD symptoms and controlled for a number of potentially important covariates, including intelligence and achievement scores. The EF Planning and Organization subscale as rated by both parents and teachers predicted school grades above and beyond symptoms of ADHD and relevant covariates. Parent ratings of youth's ability to transition effectively between tasks/situations (Shift subscale) also predicted school grades. Parent-rated symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and planning and organization abilities were significant in the final model predicting homework problems. In contrast, only symptoms of inattention and the Organization of Materials subscale from the BRIEF were significant in the teacher model predicting homework problems. Organization and planning abilities are highly important aspects academic functioning for middle-school-aged youth with ADHD. Implications of these findings for the measurement of EF, and organization and planning abilities in particular, are discussed along with potential implications for intervention."
23640065,Enduring links from childhood mathematics and reading achievement to adult socioeconomic status,Stuart J Ritchie,"Understanding the determinants of socioeconomic status (SES) is an important economic and social goal. Several major influences on SES are known, yet much of the variance in SES remains unexplained. In a large, population-representative sample from the United Kingdom, we tested the effects of mathematics and reading achievement at age 7 on attained SES by age 42. Mathematics and reading ability both had substantial positive associations with adult SES, above and beyond the effects of SES at birth, and with other important factors, such as intelligence. Achievement in mathematics and reading was also significantly associated with intelligence scores, academic motivation, and duration of education. These findings suggest effects of improved early mathematics and reading on SES attainment across the life span."
23639964,A 1.1Mb deletion in distal 13q deletion syndrome region with congenital heart defect and postaxial polydactyly: additional support for a CHD locus at distal 13q34 region,Yi-Feng Yang,"13q deletion syndrome is a rare genetic disorder, especially for group 3 deletion (13q33-q34 deletion). Previously we described a patient with congenital heart defect and mental retardation and proposed that a distal 6Mb region might contain the causative gene of congenital heart defect. Here we present a new patient with congenital heart defects (CHD), hand and foot anomalies and mild mental retardation. We identified a 1.1Mb deletion at chromosome 13q34 with high resolution SNP-array BeadChips (HumanOmni1-Quad, Illumina, USA). This chromosome region contains ten annotated genes, including GRK1, TFDP1, RASA3 and GAS6. To our knowledge, this represents the smallest 13q34 deletion identified to date. Our study provides additional support that distal 13q34 deletion region might contain key gene(s) responsible for cardiac development."
23638580,Effective radiology dashboards: key research findings,Mahtab Karami,"Innovative organizations have access to information for business intelligence through the objectives displayed in dashboards. In healthcare organizations, where the goal is to improve quality of care along with reducing costs, the radiology department is important from both financial and clinical aspects. Therefore, how to manage this department has critical impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization. Today, since the information in this department not only has different data structure but also is gathered from different data sources, a well defined, comprehensive dashboard can be an effective tool to enhance performance."
23637732,Priming intelligent behavior: an elusive phenomenon,David R Shanks,"Can behavior be unconsciously primed via the activation of attitudes, stereotypes, or other concepts? A number of studies have suggested that such priming effects can occur, and a prominent illustration is the claim that individuals' accuracy in answering general knowledge questions can be influenced by activating intelligence-related concepts such as professor or soccer hooligan. In 9 experiments with 475 participants we employed the procedures used in these studies, as well as a number of variants of those procedures, in an attempt to obtain this intelligence priming effect. None of the experiments obtained the effect, although financial incentives did boost performance. A Bayesian analysis reveals considerable evidential support for the null hypothesis. The results conform to the pattern typically obtained in word priming experiments in which priming is very narrow in its generalization and unconscious (subliminal) influences, if they occur at all, are extremely short-lived. We encourage others to explore the circumstances in which this phenomenon might be obtained."
23637698,"Reliability, validity, and optimal cutoff score of the montreal cognitive assessment (changsha version) in ischemic cerebrovascular disease patients of hunan province, china",Qiu-Yun Tu,"Background/aims: The goal of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of the Changsha version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-CS) in ischemic cerebrovascular disease patients of Hunan Province, China, and to explore the optimal cutoff score for detecting vascular cognitive impairment-no dementia (VCI-ND) and vascular dementia (VD). Methods: Three hundred and thirty-eight ischemic cerebrovascular disease patients (131 with normal cognition, 111 with VCI-ND, and 96 with VD) and 132 healthy controls were recruited. All participants accepted examination by the MoCA-CS, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and other related scales. A detailed neuropsychological battery was used for making a final cognitive diagnosis. SPSS 16.0 statistical software was used for reliability, validity examination, and optimal cutoff score detection. Results: Cronbach's α of the MoCA-CS was 0.884, and test-retest and interrater reliability of the MoCA-CS were 0.966 and 0.926, respectively. MoCA-CS scores were highly correlated with MMSE scores (r = 0.867) and simplified intelligence quotients (r = 0.822). The results indicate that 1 point should be added for subjects with less than 6 years of education, and that the optimal cutoff score for detecting VCI-ND is 26/27 (sensitivity 96.1%, specificity 75.6%), whereas the optimal cutoff score for detecting VD is 16/17 (sensitivity 92.7%, specificity 96.3%). Conclusion: The MoCA-CS has good reliability and validity, and is a useful cognitive screening instrument for detecting VCI in the Chinese population."
23633396,Evaluating the potential of artificial neural network and neuro-fuzzy techniques for estimating antioxidant activity and anthocyanin content of sweet cherry during ripening by using image processing,Saeedeh Taghadomi-Saberi,"Background: This paper presents a versatile way for estimating antioxidant activity and anthocyanin content at different ripening stages of sweet cherry by combining image processing and two artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. In comparison with common time-consuming laboratory methods for determining these important attributes, this new way is economical and much faster. The accuracy of artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models was studied to estimate the outputs. Sensitivity analysis and principal component analysis were used with ANN and ANFIS respectively to specify the most effective attributes on outputs. Results: Among the designed ANNs, two hidden layer networks with 11-14-9-1 and 11-6-20-1 architectures had the highest correlation coefficients and lowest error values for modeling antioxidant activity (R = 0.93) and anthocyanin content (R = 0.98) respectively. ANFIS models with triangular and two-term Gaussian membership functions gave the best results for antioxidant activity (R = 0.87) and anthocyanin content (R = 0.90) respectively. Conclusion: Comparison of the models showed that ANN outperformed ANFIS for this case. By considering the advantages of the applied system and the accuracy obtained in somewhat similar studies, it can be concluded that both techniques presented here have good potential to be used as estimators of proposed attributes."
23632828,Associations between social anxiety and emotional intelligence within clinically depressed patients,Karen Nolidin,"Impairments in emotional intelligence (EI) have been found in individuals with high general and social anxiety; however, no studies have examined this relationship in a clinically depressed population. Thirty-one patients (11 male, 20 female) with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of a major affective disorder and 28 non-clinical controls (5 male, 23 female) completed self-report instruments assessing EI, depression and social anxiety. Compared to a control group, the clinical group scored lower on the EI dimensions of Emotional Recognition and Expression, Understanding Emotions, Emotional Management, and Emotional Control. Regression analyses revealed Emotional Control was a significant predictor of interaction, performance, and generalised social anxiety. Self-report measures of EI may have predictive value in terms of early identification of those at risk of developing social anxiety and depression. The current study points to the potential value of conducting further studies of a prospective nature."
23631511,Multilocus genetic models of handedness closely resemble single-locus models in explaining family data and are compatible with genome-wide association studies,I C McManus,"Right- and left-handedness run in families, show greater concordance in monozygotic than dizygotic twins, and are well described by single-locus Mendelian models. Here we summarize a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) that finds no significant associations with handedness and is consistent with a meta-analysis of GWASs. The GWAS had 99% power to detect a single locus using the conventional criterion of P < 5 × 10(-8) for the single locus models of McManus and Annett. The strong conclusion is that handedness is not controlled by a single genetic locus. A consideration of the genetic architecture of height, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and intelligence suggests that handedness inheritance can be explained by a multilocus variant of the McManus DC model, classical effects on family and twins being barely distinguishable from the single locus model. Based on the ENGAGE meta-analysis of GWASs, we estimate at least 40 loci are involved in determining handedness."
23630508,Short-term attentional perseveration associated with real-life creative achievement,Darya L Zabelina,"There are at least two competing hypotheses of how attention interacts with creative cognition, although they are not mutually exclusive. The first hypothesis is that highly creative people are particularly flexible at switching their attention - that is, they adaptively shift focus among different attentional levels using cognitive control. The second, less common, view is that creative people exhibit attentional persistence, or an ability for sustained attention. We suggest these two views need not be competing, as they may both operate, but on different time scales or on different components of creativity. In the present study we examined the role of attention in real-world creative achievement and in divergent thinking. In Experiment 1 participants with high and low real-world creative achievements identified whether the stimulus contained letters S or H within hierarchically constructed letters (e.g., large S made of small Es - global level; large E made up of small Ss - local level), which were presented in blocks of eight trials per level. In Experiment 2 participants with high, medium, and low creative achievements identified the same stimulus letters, but in blocks of five, seven, and nine trials per level. Results from both experiments indicated that people with high creative achievements made significantly more errors on trials in which they had to switch the level of attention, even after controlling for general intelligence. In Experiment 2, divergent thinking was also assessed, but it was not related to switching cost. Results from both experiments demonstrate that real-world creative acts relate to increased levels of attentional persistence, even if it comes with the cost of perseveration in certain circumstances."
23630286,Neural predictors of individual differences in response to math tutoring in primary-grade school children,Kaustubh Supekar,"Now, more than ever, the ability to acquire mathematical skills efficiently is critical for academic and professional success, yet little is known about the behavioral and neural mechanisms that drive some children to acquire these skills faster than others. Here we investigate the behavioral and neural predictors of individual differences in arithmetic skill acquisition in response to 8-wk of one-to-one math tutoring. Twenty-four children in grade 3 (ages 8-9 y), a critical period for acquisition of basic mathematical skills, underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI scans pretutoring. A significant shift in arithmetic problem-solving strategies from counting to fact retrieval was observed with tutoring. Notably, the speed and accuracy of arithmetic problem solving increased with tutoring, with some children improving significantly more than others. Next, we examined whether pretutoring behavioral and brain measures could predict individual differences in arithmetic performance improvements with tutoring. No behavioral measures, including intelligence quotient, working memory, or mathematical abilities, predicted performance improvements. In contrast, pretutoring hippocampal volume predicted performance improvements. Furthermore, pretutoring intrinsic functional connectivity of the hippocampus with dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices and the basal ganglia also predicted performance improvements. Our findings provide evidence that individual differences in morphometry and connectivity of brain regions associated with learning and memory, and not regions typically involved in arithmetic processing, are strong predictors of responsiveness to math tutoring in children. More generally, our study suggests that quantitative measures of brain structure and intrinsic brain organization can provide a more sensitive marker of skill acquisition than behavioral measures."
23629689,Altered semantic integration in autism beyond language: a cross-modal event-related potentials study,Tatiane C Ribeiro,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by impaired communication, particularly pragmatic and semantic language, resulting in verbal comprehension deficits. Semantic processing in these conditions has been studied extensively, but mostly limited only to linguistic material. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that semantic integration deficits may extend beyond the verbal domain. Here, we explored cross-modal semantic integration using visual targets preceded by musical and linguistic cues. Particularly, we have recorded the event-related potentials to evaluate whether the N400 and late positive potential (LPP) components, two widely studied electrophysiological markers of semantic processing, are differently sensitive to congruence with respect to typically developing children. Seven ASD patients and seven neurotypical participants matched by age, education and intelligence quotient provided usable data. Neuroelectric activity was recorded in response to visual targets that were related or unrelated to a preceding spoken sentence or musical excerpt. The N400 was sensitive to semantic congruence in the controls but not the patients, whereas the LPP showed a complementary pattern. These results suggest that semantic processing in ASD children is also altered in the context of musical and visual stimuli, and point to a functional decoupling between the generators of the N400 and LPP, which may indicate delayed semantic processing. These novel findings underline the importance of exploring semantic integration across multiple modalities in ASDs and provide motivation for further investigation in large clinical samples."
23628534,A predictive study of reading comprehension in third-grade Spanish students,Carmen López-Escribano,"Background: The study of the contribution of language and cognitive skills to reading comprehension is an important goal of current reading research. However, reading comprehension is not easily assessed by a single instrument, as different comprehension tests vary in the type of tasks used and in the cognitive demands required. Method: This study examines the contribution of basic language and cognitive skills (decoding, word recognition, reading speed, verbal and nonverbal intelligence and working memory) to reading comprehension, assessed by two tests utilizing various tasks that require different skill sets in third-grade Spanish-speaking students. Results: Linguistic and cognitive abilities predicted reading comprehension. A measure of reading speed (the reading time of pseudo-words) was the best predictor of reading comprehension when assessed by the PROLEC-R test. However, measures of word recognition (the orthographic choice task) and verbal working memory were the best predictors of reading comprehension when assessed by means of the DARC test. Conclusion: These results show, on the one hand, that reading speed and word recognition are better predictors of Spanish language comprehension than reading accuracy. On the other, the reading comprehension test applied here serves as a critical variable when analyzing and interpreting results regarding this topic."
23626650,Is High IQ Protective Against Cognitive Dysfunction in Narcoleptic Patients?,So-Mee Yoon,"Background and purpose: The aims of this study were to elucidate the cognitive functions of narcoleptics and determine whether intelligence protects against cognitive dysfunction and depressive mood in these patients. Methods: Sixty-six subjects (33 narcoleptics, 33 controls) were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests and an individual standardized intelligence test. The cognitive functions of the narcoleptic patients and the healthy controls were compared, as were those of high-IQ and mid-to-low-IQ narcoleptic patients. Results: Narcoleptics exhibited significantly lower scores in the Corsi Block-Tapping Test forward and backward, and the digit symbol tests, and significantly higher Beck Depression Inventory scores than the controls. However, verbal attention, verbal-visual long-term memory, and executive function task scores did not differ significantly between patients and controls. The mid-to-low-IQ patient group had lower mean digit span backward test, phonemic and semantic fluency Controlled Oral Word Association Test and Korean version of the Boston Naming Test scores, and a higher total score and general depressive symptoms subscales Beck Depression Inventory score than the high-IQ patient group. However, controls exhibited no IQ-related differences in cognitive performance or depressive mood. Patients in the high-IQ group exhibited impaired visual attention and working memory as compared with controls. Conclusions: The findings of the present study show that narcolepsy patients have deficits in visual attention and visual working memory, and tend to feel more general depressive symptoms but not somatic symptoms than their control, nonnarcoleptic counterparts. In addition, it appears that higher intelligence protects against cognitive dysfunction and depressive mood."
23626405,Effects of a phonological awareness program on English reading and spelling among Hong Kong Chinese ESL children,Susanna S S Yeung,"This study investigated the effects of a 12-week language-enriched phonological awareness instruction on 76 Hong Kong young children who were learning English as a second language. The children were assigned randomly to receive the instruction on phonological awareness skills embedded in vocabulary learning activities or comparison instruction which consisted of vocabulary learning and writing tasks but no direct instruction in phonological awareness skills. They were tested on receptive and expressive vocabulary, phonological awareness at the syllable, rhyme and phoneme levels, reading, and spelling in English before and after the program implementation. The results indicated that children who received the phonological awareness instruction performed significantly better than the comparison group on English word reading, spelling, phonological awareness at all levels and expressive vocabulary on the posttest when age, general intelligence and the pretest scores were controlled statistically. The findings suggest that phonological awareness instruction embedded in vocabulary learning activities might be beneficial to kindergarteners learning English as a second language."
23625352,Heat wave hazard classification and risk assessment using artificial intelligence fuzzy logic,Iphigenia Keramitsoglou,"The average summer temperatures as well as the frequency and intensity of hot days and heat waves are expected to increase due to climate change. Motivated by this consequence, we propose a methodology to evaluate the monthly heat wave hazard and risk and its spatial distribution within large cities. A simple urban climate model with assimilated satellite-derived land surface temperature images was used to generate a historic database of urban air temperature fields. Heat wave hazard was then estimated from the analysis of these hourly air temperatures distributed at a 1-km grid over Athens, Greece, by identifying the areas that are more likely to suffer higher temperatures in the case of a heat wave event. Innovation lies in the artificial intelligence fuzzy logic model that was used to classify the heat waves from mild to extreme by taking into consideration their duration, intensity and time of occurrence. The monthly hazard was subsequently estimated as the cumulative effect from the individual heat waves that occurred at each grid cell during a month. Finally, monthly heat wave risk maps were produced integrating geospatial information on the population vulnerability to heat waves calculated from socio-economic variables."
23624490,Individual alpha peak frequency is related to latent factors of general cognitive abilities,Thomas H Grandy,"Some eighty years after the discovery of the human electroencephalogram (EEG) and its dominant rhythm, alpha (~10Hz), the neurophysiological functions and behavioral correlates of alpha oscillations are still under debate. Similarly, the biological mechanisms contributing to the general factor of intelligence, or g, have been under scrutiny for decades. Individual alpha frequency (IAF), a trait-like parameter of the EEG, has been found to correlate with individual differences in cognitive performance and cognitive abilities. Informed by large-scale theories of neural organization emphasizing the general functional significance of oscillatory activity, the present study replicates and extends these findings by testing the hypothesis that IAF is related to intelligence at the level of g, rather than at the level of specific cognitive abilities. Structural equation modeling allowed us to statistically control for measurement error when estimating the association between IAF and intellectual functioning. In line with our hypothesis, we found a statistically reliable and substantial correlation between IAF and g (r=.40). The magnitude of this correlation did not differ significantly between younger and older adults, and captured all of the covariation between IAF and the cognitive abilities of reasoning, memory, and perceptual speed. The observed association between IAF and g provides a parsimonious explanation for the commonly observed diffuse pattern of correlations between IAF and cognitive performance. We conclude that IAF is a marker of global architectural and functional properties of the human brain."
23623848,Hemispherectomy in adults patients with severe unilateral epilepsy and hemiplegia,Shuli Liang,"Objectives: To study postoperative seizure control of hemispherectomy in adults with epilepsy and evaluate changes of movement and speech function, intelligence quotient (IQ) and quality of life (QOL) after hemispherectomy. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 25 adults who presented severe unilateral epilepsy and hemiplegia and underwent anatomic or functional hemispherectomy in between 2006 and 2011. Surgical outcomes, including seizure-control at last follow-up, changes of aphasia quotient, hemiplegic side motor function, IQ and QOL from pre-operative to 2 years follow-up, were investigated. Results were statistically analyzed with SPSS 18.0. Results: Nine functional hemispherectomies and 16 anatomic hemispherectomies were performed. Ninety-two percent of patients were seizure-free and 8% displayed Engel II grade seizure control after the procedure. Impaired movement function was present in 9 (36%) adults' upper limbs and 5 (20%) patients' lower limbs. The patients with age at seizure onset <3 years showed improvement in mean motor function of the upper limbs. Impaired speech was seen in 7 patients with left hemispherectomies. There was an overall improvement in the mean aphasia quotient and significant difference was found in amount of change in aphasia quotients between patients with different ages of onset. All of the patients' postoperative scores of overall QOL, full IQ, verbal IQ and performance IQ improved compared with pretreatment scores and those improvements were not associated with patient's age at seizure onset or surgical approach. However, significant difference was found in change of verbal IQ between patients with right hemispherectomies and those with left hemispherectomies. Surgical complications included a single case of hydrocephalus, and 6 transient complications. Conclusions: Hemispherectomy presented good seizure control and improvement in QOL and IQ, and impairment on motor and speech function were mild. Furthermore, patients with early seizure onset could maintain movement function of upper limb and speech function improvement. Therefore, it is worth pursuing hemispherectomy in well-selected adults with severe unilateral epilepsy and hemiplegia."
23623449,Negative symptom improvement during cognitive rehabilitation: results from a 2-year trial of Cognitive Enhancement Therapy,Shaun M Eack,"Cognitive rehabilitation has shown beneficial effects on cognition in patients with schizophrenia, which may also help to improve negative symptoms due to overlapping pathophysiology between these two domains. To better understand the possible relationship between these areas, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the effects of Cognitive Enhancement Therapy (CET) on negative symptoms. Early course schizophrenia outpatients (n=58) were randomized to 2 years of CET or an Enriched Supportive Therapy (EST) control condition. Results revealed significant and medium-sized (d=0.61) differential improvements favoring CET in overall negative symptoms, particularly social withdrawal, affective flattening, and motor retardation. Neurocognitive improvement was associated with reduced negative symptoms in CET, but not EST patients. No relationships were observed between improvements in emotion processing aspects of social cognition, as measured by the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test, and negative symptoms. CET represents an effective cognitive rehabilitation intervention for schizophrenia that may also have benefits to negative symptoms. Future studies specifically designed to examine negative symptoms during the course of cognitive rehabilitation are needed."
23621878,"Impulsivity and seizure frequency, but not cognitive deficits, impact social adjustment in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy",Sylvie Moschetta,"Purpose: Despite growing evidence on the occurrence of poor psychosocial adjustment, to the moment there is no formal assessment of social adjustment (SA) using a validated instrument developed and standardized for this purpose in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). We aimed to: (1) verify social adjustment in patients with JME with an objective scale and; (2) identify whether clinical variables, impulsiveness, and neuropsychological profile are associated with worse social adjustment. Methods: We prospectively evaluated 42 patients with an unequivocal diagnosis of JME and 42 controls. The inclusion criteria for patients and controls included age range from 16 to 40 years and an estimated intelligence quotient (IQ) ranging from 85 to 110. One trained neuropsychologist administered the scales and tests in a standard sequence. Social Adjustment was evaluated by The Self-Report Social Adjustment Scale (Weissman & Bothwell, 1976), a 42-item scale, measuring performance in seven major areas: work; social and leisure activities; relationship with extended family; marital role as a spouse; parental role; membership in the family unit; and economic adequacy. Impulsivity was assessed by using the Temperament and Character Inventory (Cloninger, 2000). Patients with JME and control subjects were evaluated with a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests evaluating executive and memory functions. We evaluated the age at onset; time from onset to seizure control with antiepileptic drugs (duration of epilepsy); seizure control; frequency of myoclonic seizures; frequency of generalized tonic-clonic GTC seizures; frequency of absence seizures; family history of epilepsy; family history of psychiatric disorders; and personal history of psychiatric disorders. Key findings: The score on Global Social Adjustment was worse than controls (p = 0.001), especially on the factors: Work (p = 0.032); Extended Family (p = 0.005). Higher Novelty Seeking (NS) scores were significantly correlated with worse on Global (p = 0.002); Work (p = 0.001) and Leisure (p = 0.003). There was no correlation between cognitive performance and Social Adjustment Scale (SAS) factors. Higher seizure frequency--myoclonic (p = 0.005) and GTC (p = 0.035)--were correlated with higher scores on factor Work of SAS. Significance: Our findings suggest that patients with JME have worse social adjustment in two relevant aspects of their lives--work and familiar relationship. In this series of patients with JME, higher seizure frequency and impulsive traits, but not cognitive performance, were correlated with worse social adjustment."
23621353,Emotional intelligence: enhancing values-based practice and compassionate care in nursing,Bob Rankin,"Aims: This article reports on a study which examined the predictive relationship between emotional intelligence and the following programme outcomes for student nurses: clinical practice performance; academic performance and retention. Background: In the context of concerns about a lack of compassionate care and amid calls for values-based selection procedures, emotional intelligence is emerging as a potential factor which might help the nursing profession to address some of these concerns. Design: The study employed a longitudinal survey. Methods: Student nurse applicants (n = 307) were asked to complete self-report scales to establish a total score and four subscores for emotional intelligence and these scores were matched to individual student's performance on the undergraduate programme. The scales were completed between June-September 2007 and performance data were collected up until January 2009. Results: A significant predictive relationship was found between emotional intelligence and all three programme outcomes: practice performance; academic performance and retention, after controlling for prior academic achievement, age and gender. There was a zero Pearson correlation between prior academic attainment and overall emotional intelligence, indicating that both predict different outcomes. Conclusions: Recruitment and selection procedures should consider emotional intelligence as a legitimate additional entrance criterion for student nurses and further research is required to examine the potential relationship between emotional intelligence and compassionate care."
25170475,Mining social media and web searches for disease detection,Y Tony Yang,"Web-based social media is increasingly being used across different settings in the health care industry. The increased frequency in the use of the Internet via computer or mobile devices provides an opportunity for social media to be the medium through which people can be provided with valuable health information quickly and directly. While traditional methods of detection relied predominately on hierarchical or bureaucratic lines of communication, these often failed to yield timely and accurate epidemiological intelligence. New web-based platforms promise increased opportunities for a more timely and accurate spreading of information and analysis. This article aims to provide an overview and discussion of the availability of timely and accurate information. It is especially useful for the rapid identification of an outbreak of an infectious disease that is necessary to promptly and effectively develop public health responses. These web-based platforms include search queries, data mining of web and social media, process and analysis of blogs containing epidemic key words, text mining, and geographical information system data analyses. These new sources of analysis and information are intended to complement traditional sources of epidemic intelligence. Despite the attractiveness of these new approaches, further study is needed to determine the accuracy of blogger statements, as increases in public participation may not necessarily mean the information provided is more accurate."
23619711,Leveraging social networks for toxicovigilance,Michael Chary,"The landscape of drug abuse is shifting. Traditional means of characterizing these changes, such as national surveys or voluntary reporting by frontline clinicians, can miss changes in usage the emergence of novel drugs. Delays in detecting novel drug usage patterns make it difficult to evaluate public policy aimed at altering drug abuse. Increasingly, newer methods to inform frontline providers to recognize symptoms associated with novel drugs or methods of administration are needed. The growth of social networks may address this need. The objective of this manuscript is to introduce tools for using data from social networks to characterize drug abuse. We outline a structured approach to analyze social media in order to capture emerging trends in drug abuse by applying powerful methods from artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, graph theory, and agent-based modeling. First, we describe how to obtain data from social networks such as Twitter using publicly available automated programmatic interfaces. Then, we discuss how to use artificial intelligence techniques to extract content useful for purposes of toxicovigilance. This filtered content can be employed to generate real-time maps of drug usage across geographical regions. Beyond describing the real-time epidemiology of drug abuse, techniques from computational linguistics can uncover ways that drug discussions differ from other online conversations. Next, graph theory can elucidate the structure of networks discussing drug abuse, helping us learn what online interactions promote drug abuse and whether these interactions differ among drugs. Finally, agent-based modeling relates online interactions to psychological archetypes, providing a link between epidemiology and behavior. An analysis of social media discussions about drug abuse patterns with computational linguistics, graph theory, and agent-based modeling permits the real-time monitoring and characterization of trends of drugs of abuse. These tools provide a powerful complement to existing methods of toxicovigilance."
23618427,Psychosocial and cognitive function in children with nephrotic syndrome: association with disease and treatment variables,Panagiota Manti,"Background: To investigate possible differences in emotional/behavioral problems and cognitive function in children with nephrotic syndrome compared to healthy controls and to examine the effect of disease-specific and steroid treatment-specific characteristics on the abovementioned variables. Methods: Forty-one patients with nephrotic syndrome (23 boys, age range: 4.4-15.2 years) and 42 sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects (20 boys, age range: 4.1-13.4 years) were enrolled in the study. Disease (severity, age of diagnosis, duration) and steroid treatment (total duration, present methylprednisolone dose and duration of present dose) data were collected. In order to assess children's emotional/behavioral problems, the Child Behavior Checklist was administered. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Third Edition was administered to assess Full-Scale, Verbal, and Performance intelligence quotient (IQ) scores. Results: The patients presented with more internalizing problems (P = 0.015), including withdrawal (P = 0.012) and somatic complaints (P = 0 .011), but not more anxiety/depression or externalizing problems. A significant association was found between severity of disease and somatic complaints (P = 0.017) as well as externalizing problems (P = 0.030). Years of illness were significantly more in those presenting with abnormal anxiety/depression (P = 0.011). Duration of steroid medication was significantly higher among those presenting with abnormal anxiety/depression (P = 0.011) and externalizing problems (P = 0.039). IQ was not associated significantly with disease or steroid treatment variables. Conclusions: Psychosocial factors and outcomes may be important correlates of children's nephrotic syndrome and potential targets of thorough assessment and treatment."
23617960,An enhancement of binary particle swarm optimization for gene selection in classifying cancer classes,Mohd Saberi Mohamad,"Background: Gene expression data could likely be a momentous help in the progress of proficient cancer diagnoses and classification platforms. Lately, many researchers analyze gene expression data using diverse computational intelligence methods, for selecting a small subset of informative genes from the data for cancer classification. Many computational methods face difficulties in selecting small subsets due to the small number of samples compared to the huge number of genes (high-dimension), irrelevant genes, and noisy genes. Methods: We propose an enhanced binary particle swarm optimization to perform the selection of small subsets of informative genes which is significant for cancer classification. Particle speed, rule, and modified sigmoid function are introduced in this proposed method to increase the probability of the bits in a particle's position to be zero. The method was empirically applied to a suite of ten well-known benchmark gene expression data sets. Results: The performance of the proposed method proved to be superior to other previous related works, including the conventional version of binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) in terms of classification accuracy and the number of selected genes. The proposed method also requires lower computational time compared to BPSO."
23615877,"Systems biology of cancer: entropy, disorder, and selection-driven evolution to independence, invasion and ""swarm intelligence""",M Tarabichi,"Our knowledge of the biology of solid cancer has greatly progressed during the last few years, and many excellent reviews dealing with the various aspects of this biology have appeared. In the present review, we attempt to bring together these subjects in a general systems biology narrative. It starts from the roles of what we term entropy of signaling and noise in the initial oncogenic events, to the first major transition of tumorigenesis: the independence of the tumor cell and the switch in its physiology, i.e., from subservience to the organism to its own independent Darwinian evolution. The development after independence involves a constant dynamic reprogramming of the cells and the emergence of a sort of collective intelligence leading to invasion and metastasis and seldom to the ultimate acquisition of immortality through inter-individual infection. At each step, the probability of success is minimal to infinitesimal, but the number of cells possibly involved and the time scale account for the relatively high occurrence of tumorigenesis and metastasis in multicellular organisms."
23615581,A survey of body sensor networks,Xiaochen Lai,"The technology of sensor, pervasive computing, and intelligent information processing is widely used in Body Sensor Networks (BSNs), which are a branch of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). BSNs are playing an increasingly important role in the fields of medical treatment, social welfare and sports, and are changing the way humans use computers. Existing surveys have placed emphasis on the concept and architecture of BSNs, signal acquisition, context-aware sensing, and system technology, while this paper will focus on sensor, data fusion, and network communication. And we will introduce the research status of BSNs, the analysis of hotspots, and future development trends, the discussion of major challenges and technical problems facing currently. The typical research projects and practical application of BSNs are introduced as well. BSNs are progressing along the direction of multi-technology integration and intelligence. Although there are still many problems, the future of BSNs is fundamentally promising, profoundly changing the human-machine relationships and improving the quality of people's lives."
23615578,Working memory training in old age: an examination of transfer and maintenance effects,Erika Borella,"The present study examined the efficacy of a verbal working memory (WM) training program in old-old individuals (over 75 years of age). Thirty-six adults aged 75-87 took part in the study: 18 were randomly assigned to receive training and the remainder served as active controls. Specific training gains in a verbal WM task (criterion task), and transfer effects on measures of visuospatial WM, short-term memory, inhibition, processing speed, and fluid intelligence were examined. The trained old-old adults performed better than the controls in the criterion task, and this benefit persisted after 8 months; they also showed an increase in the efficiency of inhibitory mechanisms at follow-up compared with pretest. The results of this study suggest that the present WM training program produces benefits maintained over time even in old-old adults. These findings confirm that there is still room for plasticity in the basic mechanisms of cognition in advance old age."
23614527,Personal factors related to compassion fatigue in health professionals,Moshe Zeidner,"This study examines the role of some personal and professional factors in compassion fatigue among health-care professionals. Research participants included 182 (89 mental and 93 medical) health-care professionals who completed an assessment battery measuring compassion fatigue, emotion management, trait emotional intelligence, situation-specific coping strategies, and negative affect. Major findings indicate that both self-report ""trait"" emotional intelligence and ability-based emotion management are inversely associated with compassion fatigue; adaptive coping is inversely related to compassion fatigue; and differences exist between mental and medical professions in emotional intelligence, coping strategies, and negative affect. Furthermore, problem-focused coping appears to mediate the association between trait emotional intelligence and compassion fatigue. These findings shed light on the role of emotional factors in compassion fatigue among health-care professionals. Beyond enhancing our knowledge of practitioners' professional quality of life, the current study serves as a basis for the early identification of groups of practitioners at risk for compassion fatigue."
25206409,Is Goshinjo therapy effective in cognitive impairment after severe traumatic brain injury?,Keiji Hashimoto,"We report a case of a 21-year-old man who had severe traumatic brain injury as a result of an accident at the age of 16 years. Two years and 4 months after the trauma, at the age of 19 years, he still had severe right hemiplegia and cognitive dysfunction including aphasia and attention and memory disturbance. Conventional rehabilitation programs could not resolve all of the neuropsychological problems. He started receiving Goshinjo therapy over a period of 22 months. Following the therapy, significant improvements in verbal intelligence quotient (assessed by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition) and attention and concentration function (using the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised), and remission of traumatic epilepsy were observed. Goshinjo therapy is suspected to be effective in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in the chronic stage after severe traumatic brain injury."
23613939,Remote guidance of untrained turtles by controlling voluntary instinct behavior,Serin Lee,"Recently, several studies have been carried out on the direct control of behavior in insects and other lower animals in order to apply these behaviors to the performance of specialized tasks in an attempt to find more efficient means of carrying out these tasks than artificial intelligence agents. While most of the current methods cause involuntary behavior in animals by electronically stimulating the corresponding brain area or muscle, we show that, in turtles, it is also possible to control certain types of behavior, such as movement trajectory, by evoking an appropriate voluntary instinctive behavior. We have found that causing a particular behavior, such as obstacle avoidance, by providing a specific visual stimulus results in effective control of the turtle's movement. We propose that this principle may be adapted and expanded into a general framework to control any animal behavior as an alternative to robotic probes."
23613315,Morphology and variation in porpoise (Cetacea: Phocoenidae) cranial endocasts,Rachel A Racicot,"Evolution of endocranial anatomy in cetaceans is important from the perspective of echolocation ability, intelligence, social structure, and alternate pathways for circulation to the brain. Apart from the importance of studying brain shape and asymmetries as they relate to aspects of behavior and intelligence, cranial endocasts can show a close correspondence to the hydrostatic shape of the brain in life, and canals and grooves can preserve features of the circulatory system. Multiple samples are rarely available for studies of individual variation, especially in fossils, thus a first step in quantifying variation and making comparisons with fossils is made possible with CT scans of osteological specimens. This study presents a series of high-resolution X-ray CT-derived cranial endocasts of six extant species of Phocoenidae, a clade including some of the smallest and one of the rarest cetaceans. Degree of gyrification varies interspecifically and intraspecifically, possibly resulting from variation in preservation of the ossified meninges. Computed tomographic data show that visually assessed asymmetry in the cranial endocasts is not correlated with volumetric measurements, but nonetheless may reflect torsion in the skull's shape such that the right cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres extend rostrally and laterally more than the left. Vasculature and canals are similar to other described cetacean species, but the hypophyseal casts are unusual. Similarities between brain shape and volume measurements in the different species can be attributed to paedomorphism and concomitant variation in ecological preferences. This may explain similarities Neophocaena phocaenoides and Phocoena sinus share with the juvenile Phocoena phocoena specimen studied."
23610402,Limits in decision making arise from limits in memory retrieval,Gyslain Giguère,"Some decisions, such as predicting the winner of a baseball game, are challenging in part because outcomes are probabilistic. When making such decisions, one view is that humans stochastically and selectively retrieve a small set of relevant memories that provides evidence for competing options. We show that optimal performance at test is impossible when retrieving information in this fashion, no matter how extensive training is, because limited retrieval introduces noise into the decision process that cannot be overcome. One implication is that people should be more accurate in predicting future events when trained on idealized rather than on the actual distributions of items. In other words, we predict the best way to convey information to people is to present it in a distorted, idealized form. Idealization of training distributions is predicted to reduce the harmful noise induced by immutable bottlenecks in people's memory retrieval processes. In contrast, machine learning systems that selectively weight (i.e., retrieve) all training examples at test should not benefit from idealization. These conjectures are strongly supported by several studies and supporting analyses. Unlike machine systems, people's test performance on a target distribution is higher when they are trained on an idealized version of the distribution rather than on the actual target distribution. Optimal machine classifiers modified to selectively and stochastically sample from memory match the pattern of human performance. These results suggest firm limits on human rationality and have broad implications for how to train humans tasked with important classification decisions, such as radiologists, baggage screeners, intelligence analysts, and gamblers."
23609958,Brief report: cognitive performance in autism and Asperger's syndrome: what are the differences?,Stefano Taddei,"Autism spectrum disorders include autistic and Asperger's Syndrome (AS), often studied in terms of executive functions (EF), with controversial results. Using Planning Attention Simultaneous Successive theory (PASS; Das et al. in Assessment of cognitive processes: the PASS theory of intelligence. Allyn and Bacon, Boston, MA, 1994), this research compares the cognitive profiles obtained by the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS; Naglieri and Das in Cognitive assessment system. Riverside, Itasca, IL, 1997) of 15 subjects with typical development, 18 with autistic disorder and 20 with AS. Results highlight lower profiles for children with autistic and AS compared with typical development and even lower Planning and Attention processes for the group with autistic disorders than that with Asperger's. Subjects with Asperger's diagnosis do not differ from those with typical development as regards Simultaneous and Successive processes. Results are discussed in the light of current studies about EF."
23609157,DNA evidence for strong genome-wide pleiotropy of cognitive and learning abilities,Maciej Trzaskowski,"Very different neurocognitive processes appear to be involved in cognitive abilities such as verbal and non-verbal ability as compared to learning abilities taught in schools such as reading and mathematics. However, twin studies that compare similarity for monozygotic and dizygotic twins suggest that the same genes are largely responsible for genetic influence on these diverse aspects of cognitive function. It is now possible to test this evidence for strong pleiotropy using DNA alone from samples of unrelated individuals. Here we used this new method with 1.7 million DNA markers for a sample of 2,500 unrelated children at age 12 to investigate for the first time the extent of pleiotropy between general cognitive ability (aka intelligence) and learning abilities (reading, mathematics and language skills). We also compared these DNA results to results from twin analyses using the same sample and measures. The DNA-based method revealed strong genome-wide pleiotropy: Genetic correlations were greater than 0.70 between general cognitive ability and language, reading, and mathematics, results that were highly similar to twin study estimates of genetic correlations. These results indicate that genes related to diverse neurocognitive processes have general rather than specific effects."
23608384,Longitudinal follow-up of patients with mild traumatic brain injury by magnetic resonance spectroscopic technique,Jing Chen,"Objective: To explore the changes in the concentrations of neural markers immediately or several months after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Methods: The metabolic markers of neurons in white matter tissues above the lateral ventricle were semi-quantitatively determined by employing 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopic technique (1-H-MRS) in 30 clinically diagnosed cases of mTBI. At the same time, the neurological functions of the subjects, including ability to pay attention, memory, working memory and operational capacity etc were also assessed. Results: The patients were followed up for, on average, 13 days after mTBI and the results showed that Cre, PCre and Glx in the white matter tissues were significantly elevated in mTBI patients. 17 patients (57%) recovered from the injury during the follow-up (median was defined as the 40th post-trauma day). Comparison in terms of intelligence among groups revealed that the levels of neural markers of intelligence development was positively related with intelligence scores). Conclusions: Change in Glx concentrations is most sensitive during trauma or in ensuing repairing processes, and might be different from normal status in the following months and Glx level tends to be accompanied with change in Cre, another energy-related marker."
23605604,Emotional intelligence of medical residents of Tehran University of Medical Sciences,Mahsa Ghajarzadeh,"Nowadays, educators pay attention to emotional intelligence which is defined as the ability to monitor and explain one's own and other's emotional experience and feelings to differentiate between them as well as applying necessary information for determining thoughts and actions. The goal of this study was to determine emotional intelligence of medical residents of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. By means of two stage cluster sampling, 98 medical residents of Tehran University of Medical Sciences were selected. Participants were asked to fill valid and reliable Persian version of Emotional Quotient inventory (EQ-i) questionnaire which had been developed due to Bar-On model. Seventy two filled-up questionnaires were returned (RR=73%). Mean EI score of all participants was 319.94 ± 32.4. Mean EI score was not significantly different between male and female also, single and married participants. EI did not differ significantly in residents in respect to their discipline. Mean responsibility subscale differ significantly between male and female participants (P=0.008). Multiple regression analysis showed that happiness subscale is a predictive factor for total EI score (B=-0.32, P=0.009). Responsibility subscale differed significantly between men and women participants and happiness subscale was a good predictor for emotional intelligence score. These factors should be considered in education of medical residents."
23603064,Neural correlate of impulsivity in subjects at ultra-high risk for psychosis,Tae Young Lee,"Objective: Impulsivity is one of the most commonly reported behavioral characteristics of patients with schizophrenia. Although there is accumulating evidence regarding behavioral problems in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis, as yet, no study has reported on impulsivity in this population. The aim of the present study was to assess impulsivity in UHR subjects and to investigate the associated gray matter correlates. Method: This study included 32 UHR subjects and 32 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs). The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale version-11 (BIS-11) was employed to assess impulsivity. Differences between the groups in gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were assessed. Then, a correlational analysis between the BIS-11 scores and significant clusters of gray matter volume was conducted in UHR subjects. Results: UHR subjects were more impulsive than HC subjects in terms of attention (t = 3.5187, p<0.01), motor (t = 3.1751, p<0.01), and non-planning (t = 4.4154, p<0.01) scores. The gray matter volume of the ACC was negatively correlated with the motor (r = -0.472, p<0.01) and non-planning (r = -0.354, p = 0.04) scores of the BIS-11 in UHR subjects. Conclusion: These results suggest that impulsivity in UHR subjects may reflect altered integrated conflict processing, which likely stems from abnormalities in the ACC, rather than altered reward/punishment processing or executive control."
23601016,Franc D. Ingraham and the genesis of pediatric neurosurgery,Subash Lohani,"In 1929, Franc D. Ingraham, Harvey Cushing's protégé, established the first pediatric neurosurgical unit in the world at Boston Children's Hospital and dedicated his career to the neurosurgical care of children. He trained with both Cushing and Dandy and spent 1 year working in Oxford with Sherrington, who considered Ingraham to be the finest operative surgeon ever to work in his laboratory. Ingraham was instrumental in developing novel treatments, which he compiled in his classic book, Neurosurgery of Infancy and Childhood. Although he was modest and shy, Ingraham loved to entertain children with magic and enjoyed photography in and out of the operating room. Unfortunately, his career was plagued by personal illness, and he died young in 1965 at the age of 67. Despite his prolific 36-year neurosurgical career, Ingraham remained an associate professor at Harvard at his retirement. To recognize his remarkable contributions, Harvard established an endowed chair in his name in 1967. Ingraham was a pioneer and a leader in the development of pediatric neurosurgery by virtue of his imagination, intelligence, and ability to lead and inspire others. Cushing has come to be regarded as the founder of neurosurgery. It is fair to conclude that Ingraham, his disciple, is the founder of pediatric neurosurgery."
23600900,Maternal hypothyroxinemia and effects on cognitive functioning in childhood: how and why?,Jens Henrichs,"Exposure to maternal hypothyroxinemia during pregnancy, which is characterized by low free T4 but normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, can negatively affect the foetus. This review provides an overview of present findings concerning the association between maternal hypothyroxinemia during pregnancy and childhood cognitive functioning. Possible causes of maternal hypothyroxinemia and potential mechanisms underlying this association are also discussed. Clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that maternal hypothyroxinemia in the first half of pregnancy but not later in pregnancy impairs cognitive development in infancy and childhood. Animal models confirm that the first half of pregnancy may constitute a sensitive period in which maternal hypothyroxinemia alters neurogenesis and causes neuronal migration errors in the developing foetal brain. However, observational studies in humans cannot demonstrate causality of the association between hypothyroxinemia and neurodevelopment. In the only completed randomized trial of antenatal thyroid screening and subsequent levothyroxine treatment of mild maternal subclinical thyroid dysfunction, including hypothyroxinemia, the interventions did not affect offspring intelligence quotient (IQ). More randomized trials are needed investigating whether screening for hypothyroxinemia and its treatment earlier in the first trimester of pregnancy can improve child cognitive functioning or prevent neurodevelopmental changes. Long-term observational studies should identify molecular, neuroanatomical and neurophysiological factors involved in the association between maternal hypothyroxinemia and offspring cognitive functioning. Information on such mechanisms can be used for the development of innovative prevention and intervention studies that address maternal hypothyroxinemia and its potential consequences."
23597734,Behavioural aspects of terrorism,Samuel J Leistedt,"Behavioural and social sciences are useful in collecting and analysing intelligence data, understanding terrorism, and developing strategies to combat terrorism. This article aims to examine the psychopathological concepts of terrorism and discusses the developing roles for behavioural scientists. A systematic review was conducted of studies investigating behavioural aspects of terrorism. These studies were identified by a systematic search of databases, textbooks, and a supplementary manual search of references. Several fundamental concepts were identified that continue to influence the motives and the majority of the behaviours of those who support or engage in this kind of specific violence. Regardless of the psychological aspects and new roles for psychiatrists, the behavioural sciences will continue to be called upon to assist in developing better methods to gather and analyse intelligence, to understand terrorism, and perhaps to stem the radicalisation process."
23597732,Lab-on-a-chip screening of methamphetamine and pseudoephedrine in samples from clandestine laboratories,Aimee Lloyd,"The clandestine manufacture of methamphetamine in New Zealand predominantly involves the reduction of pseudoephedrine, extracted from pharmaceutical preparations, using hydrogen iodide. This method of illicit manufacture leaves a variety of materials at the scene that are a rich source of information. Efficient processing and preliminary identification of extraction and reaction mixtures, precursors and products is essential to minimise exposure to potential hazardous materials and to provide investigative and intelligence information. In this study, we employed a portable lab-on-a-chip instrument for the rapid and cost effective screening of methamphetamine, pseudoephedrine and ephedrine in a variety of sample types found in typical clandestine laboratory scenarios."
23597605,The role of pattern recognition in creative problem solving: a case study in search of new mathematics for biology,Felix T Hong,"Rosen classified sciences into two categories: formalizable and unformalizable. Whereas formalizable sciences expressed in terms of mathematical theories were highly valued by Rutherford, Hutchins pointed out that unformalizable parts of soft sciences are of genuine interest and importance. Attempts to build mathematical theories for biology in the past century was met with modest and sporadic successes, and only in simple systems. In this article, a qualitative model of humans' high creativity is presented as a starting point to consider whether the gap between soft and hard sciences is bridgeable. Simonton's chance-configuration theory, which mimics the process of evolution, was modified and improved. By treating problem solving as a process of pattern recognition, the known dichotomy of visual thinking vs. verbal thinking can be recast in terms of analog pattern recognition (non-algorithmic process) and digital pattern recognition (algorithmic process), respectively. Additional concepts commonly encountered in computer science, operations research and artificial intelligence were also invoked: heuristic searching, parallel and sequential processing. The refurbished chance-configuration model is now capable of explaining several long-standing puzzles in human cognition: a) why novel discoveries often came without prior warning, b) why some creators had no ideas about the source of inspiration even after the fact, c) why some creators were consistently luckier than others, and, last but not least, d) why it was so difficult to explain what intuition, inspiration, insight, hunch, serendipity, etc. are all about. The predictive power of the present model was tested by means of resolving Zeno's paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise after one deliberately invoked visual thinking. Additional evidence of its predictive power must await future large-scale field studies. The analysis was further generalized to constructions of scientific theories in general. This approach is in line with Campbell's evolutionary epistemology. Instead of treating science as immutable Natural Laws, which already existed and which were just waiting to be discovered, scientific theories are regarded as humans' mental constructs, which must be invented to reconcile with observed natural phenomena. In this way, the pursuit of science is shifted from diligent and systematic (or random) searching for existing Natural Laws to firing up humans' imagination to comprehend Nature's behavioral pattern. The insights gained in understanding human creativity indicated that new mathematics that is capable of handling effectively parallel processing and human subjectivity is sorely needed. The past classification of formalizability vs. non-formalizability was made in reference to contemporary mathematics. Rosen's conclusion did not preclude future inventions of new biology-friendly mathematics."
23597271,The influence of inhibitory processes on affective theory of mind in young and old adults,Caitlin E V Mahy,"The primary aim of this study was to examine the impact of an inhibition manipulation on the effect of age on theory of mind (ToM) in an ecologically valid, affective ToM task. Participants were 30 young and 30 old adults. The Cambridge Mindreading Face-Voice Battery was used to measure ToM; in addition, measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence were taken. Participants were subjected to three levels of inhibitory demand during ToM reasoning: emotional inhibition, non-emotional inhibition, and no inhibition. Old adults performed worse than young adults. The emotional and non-emotional inhibition conditions resulted in worse ToM performance compared to the no inhibition condition. There were no differences in the impact of the inhibition conditions on old and young adults. Regression analyses suggested that old adults' crystallized intelligence was a significant predictor of ToM performance, whereas it did not predict young adults' ToM performance. Results are discussed in terms of verbal ability as a possible compensatory mechanism in coping with verbal inhibitory load in ToM reasoning."
23596467,Effects of carotid artery stenting on cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment and carotid stenosis,Yong Cheng,"Carotid stenosis is known to be an independent risk factor in the transformation process of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia and is treated by carotid artery stenting (CAS); however, the effects of CAS on cognitive function are unclear. In this study, 240 patients were prospectively assigned to a CAS or control group according to patient preference and underwent detailed neuropsychological examinations (NPEs) before and 6 months after treatment. Cerebral perfusion was assessed with computed tomography perfusion (CTP). Among the 240 patients included in the study, 208 patients completed NPEs at baseline and 6 months after therapy. The patients in the two groups did not differ with regard to baseline characteristics, educational level, vascular risk factors (VRFs) and NPEs prior to therapy. Significant improvements in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; before, 24.6±1.7 vs. after, 24.8±1.9; P=0.016), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA; before, 23.7±1.7 vs. after, 24.1±2.0; P=0.006), Fuld Object Memory Evaluation (FOME; before, 13.8±2.2 vs. after, 14.0±2.3; P=0.031) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-digital span (WAIS-DS; before, 6.7±2.1 vs. after, 6.9±2.3; P=0.040) were observed in the CAS group; however, improvements were not observed in the control group. Of the 84 patients in the CAS group who received CTP follow-up, 72 (86%) presented improvements in ipsilateral brain perfusion 6 months after the procedure; however, no improvement was observed in the control group. Close correlations were identified between the change in perfusion and the change in MMSE (r=0.575) and MOCA (r=0.574). CAS improves global cognitive function in patients with carotid stenosis and MCI and the improvement of cognition is closely related to the improvement of cerebral perfusion."
23595408,Elevated temperature and 6- to 7-year outcome of neonatal encephalopathy,Abbot R Laptook,"Objective: A study was undertaken to determine whether higher temperature after hypoxia-ischemia is associated with death or intelligence quotient (IQ)<70 at 6 to 7 years among infants treated with intensive care without hypothermia. Methods: Control infants (noncooled, n=106) of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network hypothermia trial had serial esophageal and skin temperatures over 72 hours. Each infant's temperature was ranked to derive an average of the upper and lower quartile, and median of each site. Temperatures were used in logistic regressions to determine adjusted associations with death or IQ<70 at 6 to 7 years. Secondary outcomes were death, IQ<70, and moderate/severe cerebral palsy (CP). IQ and motor function were assessed with Wechsler Scales for Children and Gross Motor Function Classification System. Results are odds ratio (OR; per degree Celsius increment within the quartile or median) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Primary outcome was available for 89 infants. At 6 to 7 years, death or IQ<70 occurred in 54 infants (37 deaths, 17 survivors with IQ<70) and moderate/severe CP in 15 infants. Death or IQ<70 was associated with the upper quartile average of esophageal (OR=7.3, 95% CI=2.0-26.3) and skin temperature (OR=3.5, 95% CI=1.2-10.4). CP was associated with the upper quartile average of esophageal (OR=12.5, 95% CI=1.02-155) and skin temperature (OR=10.3, 95% CI=1.3-80.2). Interpretation: Among noncooled infants of a randomized trial, elevated temperatures during the first postnatal days are associated with increased odds of a worse outcome at 6 to 7 years."
23593990,"Habitual 'sleep credit' is associated with greater grey matter volume of the medial prefrontal cortex, higher emotional intelligence and better mental health",Mareen Weber,"In modern society, people often fail to obtain the amount of sleep that experts recommend for good health and performance. Insufficient sleep can lead to degraded cognitive performance and alterations in emotional functioning. However, most people also acknowledge that on a regular basis they obtain more sleep than they subjectively perceive they need at a minimum to stave off performance decrements, a construct we describe as subjective 'sleep credit'. Few people would contest the notion that getting more sleep is better, but data on both behavioural and neuroanatomical correlates of 'sleep credit' are surprisingly limited. We conducted a voxel-based morphometric study to assess cerebral grey matter correlates of habitually sleeping more than one's subjective requirements. We further tested whether these structural correlates are associated with perceived emotional intelligence and indices of psychopathology while controlling for age, gender, and total intracranial volume. In a sample of 55 healthy adults aged 18-45 years (28 males, 27 females), whole-brain multiple regression showed that habitual subjective 'sleep credit' was correlated positively with grey matter volume within regions of the left medial prefrontal cortex and right orbitofrontal gyrus. Volumes were extracted and regressed against self-report emotion and psychopathology indices. Only grey matter volume of the medial prefrontal cortex cluster correlated with greater emotional intelligence and lower scores on several indices of psychopathology. Findings converge with previous evidence of the role of the medial prefrontal cortex in the relationship between sleep and emotional functioning, and suggest that behaviour and brain structure vary with habitual 'sleep credit'."
23593448,Toxoplasmosis-associated difference in intelligence and personality in men depends on their Rhesus blood group but not ABO blood group,Jaroslav Flegr,"Background: The parasite Toxoplasma gondii influences the behaviour of infected animals and probably also personality of infected humans. Subjects with a Rhesus-positive blood group are protected against certain behavioural effects associated with Toxoplasma infection, including the deterioration of reaction times and personality factor shift. Methodology/principal findings: Here, we searched for differences in the toxoplasmosis-associated effects between RhD-positive and RhD-negative subjects by testing 502 soldiers with two personality tests and two intelligence tests. The infected subjects expressed lower levels of all potentially pathognomic factors measured with the N-70 questionnaire and in neurasthenia measured with NEO-PI-R. The RhD-positive, Toxoplasma-infected subjects expressed lower while RhD-negative, Toxoplasma-infected subjects expressed higher intelligence than their Toxoplasma-free peers. The observed Toxoplasma-associated differences were always larger in RhD-negative than in RhD-positive subjects. Conclusions: RhD phenotype plays an important role in the strength and direction of association between latent toxoplasmosis and not only psychomotor performance, but also personality and intelligence."
23593239,The molecular genetic architecture of self-employment,Matthijs J H M van der Loos,"Economic variables such as income, education, and occupation are known to affect mortality and morbidity, such as cardiovascular disease, and have also been shown to be partly heritable. However, very little is known about which genes influence economic variables, although these genes may have both a direct and an indirect effect on health. We report results from the first large-scale collaboration that studies the molecular genetic architecture of an economic variable-entrepreneurship-that was operationalized using self-employment, a widely-available proxy. Our results suggest that common SNPs when considered jointly explain about half of the narrow-sense heritability of self-employment estimated in twin data (σ(g)(2)/σ(P)(2) = 25%, h(2) = 55%). However, a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies across sixteen studies comprising 50,627 participants did not identify genome-wide significant SNPs. 58 SNPs with p<10(-5) were tested in a replication sample (n = 3,271), but none replicated. Furthermore, a gene-based test shows that none of the genes that were previously suggested in the literature to influence entrepreneurship reveal significant associations. Finally, SNP-based genetic scores that use results from the meta-analysis capture less than 0.2% of the variance in self-employment in an independent sample (p≥0.039). Our results are consistent with a highly polygenic molecular genetic architecture of self-employment, with many genetic variants of small effect. Although self-employment is a multi-faceted, heavily environmentally influenced, and biologically distal trait, our results are similar to those for other genetically complex and biologically more proximate outcomes, such as height, intelligence, personality, and several diseases."
23592151,Long-term health and development of children diagnosed prenatally with a de novo apparently balanced chromosomal rearrangement,Ingrid B Sinnerbrink,"Objective: This study aimed to determine if liveborn children with prenatally detected de novo apparently balanced chromosome rearrangements (ABCR) have more long-term health, developmental or behavioural concerns compared with children in a normal Australian population. Methods: This was a retrospective ascertainment of all liveborn children with prenatally detected de novo ABCRs in two Australian states over a 10-year period (1994-2003). Child health, development and behaviour were assessed by maternal report using standardised measures; educational ability and achievement were measured by direct child assessment. Data were compared with relevant population norms, and one sample t-test performed to test for statistical differences. Results: Of 39 eligible cases, 16 (41%) participated in the study. One child (6%) was born with a congenital anomaly, and two children (12.5%) reported a chronic health concern. Compared with population norms, no significant differences were observed with respect to intelligence, mental health, child development and educational ability; children had significantly higher scores indicative of better functioning on bodily pain, social-emotional behaviour and physical functioning. No child satisfied the criteria for having a special health care need. Conclusion: Children in this study with a prenatally detected de novo ABCR have similar long-term health, developmental and behavioural outcomes compared with population norms."
23591356,Peripheral nervous impairment in a patient with methylmalonic aciduria combined with hyperhomocysteinemia],Tao-yun Ji,"Methylmalonic aciduria combined homocysteinemia can cause multisystemic damages, mainly involving central nervous system, while the peripheral nerves are rarely impaired. A 10-year-old boy complained of weakness of both lower extremities for 1 month. His past history showed mildly delay of intelligence as well as motor development. He had proteinuria when he was 3 years old and was diagnosed as epilepsy, which was controlled by sodium valproate when he was 8 years 6 months old. His physical examination showed attenuated bilateral knee jerk reflex, while the bilateral achilles tendon reflex was absent; the examination of sensation was normal and the bilateral Babinski sign was positive. The electromyography indicated injury of peripheral nerves. The elevated levels of urine methylmalonic aciduria and plasma homocysteinemia were consistent with the diagnosis of methylmalonic aciduria combined homocysteinemia. The pathogenic gene was confirmed as MMACHC, on which two pathogenic mutations (c.365A>T and c.609G>A) were detected. cblC defect was confirmed. He was treated by vitamin B12, calcium folinate, L-carnitine and betaine supplementation, and significant improvement was observed after 6 months. According to this case, we suggest that urinary organic acid analysis and plasma homocysteine should be performed in patients with unknown peripheral neuropathy, especially combined with multisystemic damages.Early diagnosis and treatment are important to improve the prognosis."
23588083,"Measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination has no effect on cognitive development in children - the results of the Polish prospective cohort study",Dorota Mrozek-Budzyn,"Objectives: The aim of the study was to examine the hypothesis that MMR exposure has a negative influence on cognitive development in children. Furthermore, MMR was compared to single measles vaccine to determine the potential difference of these vaccines safety regarding children's cognitive development. Methods: The prospective birth cohort study with sample consisted of 369 infants born in Krakow. Vaccination history against measles (date and the type of the vaccine) was extracted from physicians' records. Child development was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-II) up to 3rd year of life, Raven test in 5th and 8th year and Wechsler (WISC-R) in 6th and 7th year. Data on possible confounders came from mothers' interview, medical records and analyses of lead and mercury level at birth and at the end of 5th year of life. Linear and logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to assess the association. Results: No significant differences in cognitive and intelligence tests results were observed between children vaccinated with MMR and those not vaccinated up to the end of the 2nd year of life. Children vaccinated with MMR had significantly higher Mental BSID-II Index (MDI) in the 36th month than those vaccinated with single measles vaccine (103.8±10.3 vs. 97.2±11.2, p=0.004). Neither results of Raven test nor WISC-R were significantly different between groups of children vaccinated with MMR and with single measles vaccine. After standardization to child's gender, maternal education, family economical status, maternal IQ, birth order and passive smoking all developmental tests were statistically insignificant. Conclusion: The results suggest that there is no relationship between MMR exposure and children's cognitive development. Furthermore, the safety of triple MMR is the same as the single measles vaccine with respect to cognitive development."
23585713,Developmental Pathways among Adaptive Functioning and Externalizing and Internalizing Behavioral Problems: Cascades from Childhood into Adolescence,Marc H Bornstein,"A developmental cascade describes a longitudinal cross-domain unique relation. Here, a 3-wave multivariate design and developmental cascade analysis were used to investigate pathways among adaptive functioning and externalizing and internalizing behavioral problems in a community sample of 134 children seen at 4, 10, and 14 years. Children, mothers, and teachers provided data. Nested path analytic models tested the plausible cascades among the three domains apart from their covariation at each age and rank-order stability across age. Adaptive functioning in early adolescence was predicted by early childhood adaptive functioning and externalizing behavioral problems, with both effects mediated by late childhood adaptive functioning and internalizing behavioral problems; externalizing behavioral problems in early adolescence were predicted by early childhood internalizing behavioral problems with the effect mediated by late childhood externalizing behavioral problems. These developmental cascades obtained independent of child intelligence; child age and maternal education and social desirability were also considered but were not related to any outcome variables. The findings suggest that strategically timed and targeted interventions designed to address young children's behavioral problems may return investment in terms of an enhanced epidemiology of adaptively functioning teens."
23584853,Premorbid IQ influence on screening tests' scores in healthy patients and patients with cognitive impairment,Lara Alves,"Cognitive screening tests are well-established tools for detecting cognitive impairment, but concerns regarding the influence of premorbid intelligence on patient's performance and cognitive status classification remain. Risk of inaccurate assessment especially affects the elders with high or low premorbid intelligence (who are more likely to be misclassified). The present study examines the influence of premorbid intelligence assessed by the TeLPI (an irregular words reading test) on 2 cognitive screening tests, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), in healthy participants and patients with cognitive impairments (mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease). Results show that premorbid IQ influences the MMSE and the MoCA scores in both the groups, predicting variance from 8.4% to 33.2%, according to test and group analyzed. Hence, we propose that whenever the MMSE or the MoCA is used, premorbid IQ evaluation should also be considered to ensure correct interpretation and classification."
23582513,Low docosahexaenoic acid status is associated with reduced indices in cortical integrity in the anterior cingulate of healthy male children: a 1H MRS Study,Robert K McNamara,"Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) is the principal omega-3 fatty acid in mammalian brain gray matter, and emerging preclinical evidence suggests that DHA has neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties. This study investigated relationships among DHA status, neurocognitive performance, and cortical metabolism measured with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) in healthy developing male children (aged 8-10 years, n = 38). Subjects were segregated into low-DHA (n = 19) and high-DHA (n = 19) status groups by a median split of erythrocyte DHA levels. Group differences in 1H MRS indices of cortical metabolism, including choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), glutamine + glutamate + γ-aminobutyric acid (Glx), myo-inositol (mI), and n-acetyl aspartate (NAA), were determined in the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R/L-DLPFC, BA9) and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, BA32/33). Group differences in neurocognitive performance were evaluated with the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test and identical-pairs version of the continuous performance task (CPT-IP). Subjects in the low-DHA group consumed fish less frequently (P = 0.02), had slower reaction times on the CPT-IP (P = 0.007), and exhibited lower mI (P = 0.007), NAA (P = 0.007), Cho (P = 0.009), and Cr (P = 0.01) concentrations in the ACC compared with the high-DHA group. There were no group differences in ACC Glx or any metabolite in the L-DLPFC and R-DLPFC. These data indicate that low-DHA status is associated with reduced indices of metabolic function in the ACC and slower reaction time during sustained attention in developing male children."
23579278,"Resting-state magnetoencephalography study of ""small world"" characteristics and cognitive dysfunction in patients with glioma",Xin-Hua Hu,"Background: The purpose of this study was to analyze ""small world"" characteristics in glioma patients in order to understand the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and brain functional connectivity network in the resting state. Methods: Resting-state magnetoencephalography was performed in 20 patients with glioma and 20 healthy subjects. The clustering coefficient of the resting functional connectivity network in the brain, average path length, and ""small world"" index (SWI) were calculated. Cognitive function was estimated by testing of attention, verbal fluency, memory, athletic ability, visual-spatial ability, and intelligence. Results: Compared with healthy controls, patients with glioma showed decreased cognitive function, and diminished low and high gamma band ""small world"" characteristics in the resting functional connectivity network. Conclusion: The SWI is associated with cognitive function and is diminished in patients with glioma, and is therefore correlated with cognition dysfunction."
23578272,"Emotional intelligence, life satisfaction and subjective happiness in female student health professionals: the mediating effect of perceived stress",D Ruiz-Aranda,"The objective of the present study was to extend previous findings by examining the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and well-being indicators (life satisfaction and happiness) in a 12-week follow-up study. In addition, we examined the influence of perceived stress on the relationship between EI and well-being. Female students from the School of Health Sciences (n = 264) completed an ability measure of emotional intelligence. After 12 weeks, participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale and Subjective Happiness Scale. Participants with higher EI reported less perceived stress and higher levels of life satisfaction and happiness. The results of this study suggest that perceived stress mediates the relationship between EI and well-being indicators, specifically life satisfaction and happiness. These findings suggest an underlying process by which high emotional intelligence may increase well-being in female students in nursing and allied health sciences by reducing the experience of stress. The implications of these findings for future research and for working with health professions to improve well-being outcomes are discussed."
23576587,What is the relationship between emotional intelligence and dental student clinical performance?,Kristin Zakariasen Victoroff,"Emotional intelligence has emerged as a key factor in differentiating average from outstanding performers in managerial and leadership positions across multiple business settings, but relatively few studies have examined the role of emotional intelligence in the health care professions. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and dental student clinical performance. All third- and fourth-year students at a single U.S. dental school were invited to participate. Participation rate was 74 percent (100/136). Dental students' EI was assessed using the Emotional Competence Inventory-University version (ECI-U), a seventy-two-item, 360-degree questionnaire completed by both self and other raters. The ECI-U measured twenty-two EI competencies grouped into four clusters (Self-Awareness, Self-Management, Social Awareness, and Relationship Management). Clinical performance was assessed using the mean grade assigned by clinical preceptors. This grade represents an overall assessment of a student's clinical performance including diagnostic and treatment planning skills, time utilization, preparation and organization, fundamental knowledge, technical skills, self-evaluation, professionalism, and patient management. Additional variables were didactic grade point average (GPA) in Years 1 and 2, preclinical GPA in Years 1 and 2, Dental Admission Test academic average and Perceptual Ability Test scores, year of study, age, and gender. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. The Self-Management cluster of competencies (b=0.448, p<0.05) and preclinical GPA (b=0.317, p<0.01) were significantly correlated with mean clinical grade. The Self-Management competencies were emotional self-control, achievement orientation, initiative, trustworthiness, conscientiousness, adaptability, and optimism. In this sample, dental students' EI competencies related to Self-Management were significant predictors of mean clinical grade assigned by preceptors. Emotional intelligence may be an important predictor of clinical performance, which has important implications for students' development during dental school."
23575273,Cognitive reserve components as expressed in traumatic brain injury,Yifat Levi,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of brain damage, resulting in long-term disability. The ""reserve"" construct has been proposed to account for the reported mismatch between brain damage and its clinical expression. Although numerous studies have used various measures thought to reflect this construct, few studies have examined its underlying structure in clinical populations, and no studies have systematically studied this construct in TBI. In the present study, structural equation modeling technique was used to evaluate several models hypothesized to represent cognitive reserve (CR) in TBI. A broad range of data typically reported in the literature as representing CR was collected from 89 individuals who sustained moderate-to-severe TBI. Analyses revealed a best fitting model that consisted of three separate factors representing premorbid intelligence, socioeconomic status and leisure activity, with distinct pattern of associations among the three factors. Findings provide empirical support for the notion of a multi-factorial CR and suggest a coherent framework for further investigation."
23574417,Physical activity during pregnancy and language development in the offspring,Anne Marie Z Jukic,"Background: In rodents, physical activity during pregnancy has been associated with improved learning and memory in the offspring. We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (born in 1991-92) to investigate maternal physical activity during pregnancy and offspring language development. Methods: At 18 weeks of gestation, women reported the hours per week they participated in 11 leisure-time physical activities and the hours per week spent in general physical activity (leisure, household and occupational). Caregivers completed a modified MacArthur Infant Communication scale at 15 months. Verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) was measured at age 8 years. Regression analysis was used to examine the associations of physical activity with MacArthur score (more than 75th percentile) and verbal IQ. The number of participants available for analyses ranged from 4529 to 7162. Results: Children of women in the two highest quintiles of leisure activity (compared with no leisure activity) were more likely to have high 15-month MacArthur scores (adjusted odds ratio 1.2 [95% confidence interval 0.9, 1.4] and adjusted odds ratio 1.4 [95% CI 1.1, 1.7], respectively). Leisure activity was not associated with IQ, while general physical activity was linked with lower verbal IQ (1 and 3 points lower for the two highest quintiles). Conclusions: The most robust finding was a transient increase in offspring vocabulary score at young ages with maternal leisure activity. Differences in the associations with leisure-time physical activity compared with general physical activity need further exploration."
23574195,Children's naive theories of intelligence influence their metacognitive judgments,David B Miele,"Recent studies have shown that the metacognitive judgments adults infer from their experiences of encoding effort vary in accordance with their naive theories of intelligence. To determine whether this finding extends to elementary schoolchildren, a study was conducted in which 27 third graders (M(age) = 8.27) and 24 fifth graders (M(age) = 10.39) read texts presented in easy- or difficult-to-encode fonts. The more children in both grades viewed intelligence as fixed, the less likely they were to interpret effortful or difficult encoding as a sign of increasing mastery and the more likely they were to report lower levels of comprehension as their perceived effort increased. This suggests that children may use naive theories of intelligence to make motivationally relevant inferences earlier than previously thought."
23572290,Gray matter reduction in the vermis and CRUS-II is associated with social and interaction deficits in low-functioning children with autistic spectrum disorders: a VBM-DARTEL Study,Daria Riva,"Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies have reported abnormalities in brain regions involved in functions that are commonly impaired in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, little is known about brain structure anomalies in low-functioning (LF) young children with ASD. A VBM analysis was carried out to assess brain regions involved in ASD LF children, and a multiple regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between regional volume changes and autism symptom measures. Twenty-six LF ASD children (2-10 years) were compared with 21 controls. A VBM-Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration analysis using Exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) was used to evaluate gray matter (GM) and white matter alterations, covaried with Intelligence Quotient, age, and total brain volume. The resulting altered regions were correlated with Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI)-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)-Generic scores. GM bilateral reduction was noted in the cerebellum (Crus II and vermis) and in the hippocampi in ASD group. GM reduction was also detected in the inferior and superior frontal gyri, in the occipital medial and superior gyri, and in the inferior temporal gyrus of the left cerebral hemisphere. In the right hemisphere, GM reduction was found in the post-central cortex and in the occipital inferior gyrus. Multiple regression analysis showed a correlation between alterations in GM volume in the cerebellum (Crus II and vermis) and ADI-communication and ADOS-total (communication and interaction) scores. These findings seem to confirm that the cerebellum is involved in integrating and regulating emotional and cognitive functions which are impaired in ASD."
23572201,Blood pressure and cognitive function: a prospective analysis among adolescents in Seychelles,Tanica Lyngdoh,"Objective: An inverse relationship between blood pressure (BP) and cognitive function has been found in adults, but limited data are available in adolescents and young adults. We examined the prospective relation between BP and cognitive function in adolescence. Methods: We examined the association between BP measured at the ages of 12-15 years in school surveys and cognitive endpoints measured in the Seychelles Child Development Study at ages 17 (n = 407) and 19 (n = 429) years, respectively. We evaluated multiple domains of cognition based on subtests of the Cambridge Neurological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), the Woodcock Johnson Test of Scholastic Achievement (WJTA), the Finger Tapping test (FT) and the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT). We used age, sex and height-specific z-scores of SBP, DBP and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Results: Six out of the 21 cognitive endpoints tested were associated with BP. However, none of these associations were found to hold for both males and females or for different subtests within the same neurodevelopmental domain or for both SBP and DBP. Most of these associations disappeared when analyses were adjusted for selected potential confounding factors such as socio-economic status, birth weight, gestational age, BMI, alcohol consumption, blood glucose, and total n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fats. Conclusions: Our findings do not support a consistent association between BP and subsequent performance on tests assessing various cognitive domains in adolescents."
23571464,"Detection, quantification, and identification of dermorphin in equine plasma and urine by LC-MS/MS for doping control",Fuyu Guan,"Dermorphin is a unique opioid peptide that is 30-40 times more potent than morphine. It was misused and went undetected in horse racing until 2011 when intelligence obtained from a few North American race tracks suggested its use. To prevent such misuse, a reliable analytical method became necessary for detection and identification of dermorphin in post-race horse samples. This paper describes the first liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for such a purpose. Equine plasma and urine samples were pre-treated with ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid and urea prior to solid-phase extraction (SPE) on Oasis MCX cartridges. Resulting eluates were dried under vacuum and analyzed by LC-MS/MS for dermorphin. The matrix effect, SPE efficiency, intra-day and inter-day accuracy and precision, and stability of the analyte were assessed. The limit of detection was 10 pg/mL in plasma and 20 pg/mL in urine, and the limit of confirmation was 20 pg/mL in plasma and 50 pg/mL in urine. Dermorphin in plasma is stable at ambient temperature, but its diastereomer is unstable. With isotopically labeled dermorphin as an internal standard, the quantification range was 20-10,000 pg/mL in plasma and 50-20,000 pg/mL in urine. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy was from 91 % to 100 % for the low, intermediate, and high concentrations. The intra-day and inter-day coefficients of variation were less than 12 %. The method differentiates dermorphin from its diastereomer. This method is very specific for identification of dermorphin in equine plasma and urine, as assessed by BLAST search and targeted SEQUEST search, and by MS/MS spectrum library search. The method has been successfully applied to analysis of samples collected following dermorphin administration to research horses and of official post-race samples."
23570911,"Association of arsenic, cadmium and manganese exposure with neurodevelopment and behavioural disorders in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis",Miguel Rodríguez-Barranco,"The aim of this study was to analyse the scientific evidence published to date on the potential effects on neurodevelopment and behavioural disorders in children exposed to arsenic, cadmium and manganese and to quantify the magnitude of the effect on neurodevelopment by pooling the results of the different studies. We conducted a systematic review of original articles from January 2000 until March 2012, that evaluate the effects on neurodevelopment and behavioural disorders due to pre or post natal exposure to arsenic, cadmium and manganese in children up to 16 years of age. We also conducted a meta-analysis assessing the effects of exposure to arsenic and manganese on neurodevelopment. Forty-one articles that evaluated the effects of metallic elements on neurodevelopment and behavioural disorders met the inclusion criteria: 18 examined arsenic, 6 cadmium and 17 manganese. Most studies evaluating exposure to arsenic (13 of 18) and manganese (14 of 17) reported a significant negative effect on neurodevelopment and behavioural disorders. Only two studies that evaluated exposure to cadmium found an association with neurodevelopmental or behavioural disorders. The results of our meta-analysis suggest that a 50% increase of arsenic levels in urine would be associated with a 0.4 decrease in the intelligence quotient (IQ) of children aged 5-15 years. Moreover a 50% increase of manganese levels in hair would be associated with a decrease of 0.7 points in the IQ of children aged 6-13 years. There is evidence that relates arsenic and manganese exposure with neurodevelopmental problems in children, but there is little information on cadmium exposure. Few studies have evaluated behavioural disorders due to exposure to these compounds, and manganese is the only one for which there is more evidence of the existence of association with attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity."
23570588,Practical executive function performance in high intelligence quotient children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder],Xiao-xiao He,"Objective: To explore the practical executive function profiles in high IQ (intelligence quotient) children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a Chinese sample population. Methods: For this cross-sectional study, we identified 124 outpatients aged 6.8 - 13.1 years with a high IQ fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for ADHD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV), 68 children and adolescents without ADHD aged 6.5 - 13.1 years with a high IQ matched by high IQ children and adolescents with ADHD, 124 outpatients aged 6.8 - 13.2 years with an average IQ with ADHD and 68 normal children and adolescents aged 6.4 - 13.1 years with an average IQ matched by IQ. We operationalized high IQ as having a full scale intelligence quotient (IQ or FSIQ) ≥ 120 on Chinese version Wechsler intelligence scale for children (C-WISC) and an average IQ as 90 ≤ IQ < 110. All the above groups were matched by age. All subjects completed practical executive function tests, including Stroop color-word, trail-making, digit span, Tower of Hanoi task and verbal fluency to assess their ability in the aspects of inhibition, shifting, working memory, planning and verbal fluency. Results: ADHD group with a high IQ performed worse on the Stroop color-word (3.18 ± 0.05) and trail-making tests (4.38 ± 0.55) than normal control group with a high IQ (2.92 ± 0.07 and 4.05 ± 0.07) (P < 0.01). The test performances of trail-making, digit span (4.86 ± 0.13) and fluency (23.0 ± 0.5) were significantly better in high IQ ADHD group than average IQ ADHD group (4.10 ± 0.07 and 19.9 ± 0.5) (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Though a bit better than average IQ ADHD group in shifting, working memory and verbal fluency, the high IQ children and adolescents with ADHD perform worse than high-IQ controls on inhibition and shifting. IQ may protect practical executive function."
23570390,The relationship between obesity and neurocognitive function in Chinese patients with schizophrenia,Xiaofeng Guo,"Background: Studies have reported that up to 60% of individuals with schizophrenia are overweight or obese. This study explored the relationship between obesity and cognitive performance in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Outpatients with schizophrenia aged 18-50 years were recruited from 10 study sites across China. Demographic and clinical information was collected. A neuropsychological battery including tests of attention, processing speed, learning/memory, and executive functioning was used to assess cognitive function, and these 4 individual domains were transformed into a neurocognitive composite z score. In addition, height and weight were measured to calculate body mass index (BMI). Patients were categorized into 4 groups (underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese) based on BMI cutoff values for Asian populations recommended by the World Health Organization. Results: A total number of 896 patients were enrolled into the study. Fifty-four percent of participants were overweight or obese. A higher BMI was significantly associated with lower scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) Visual Reproduction subscale, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) Digit Symbol subscale, and the composite z score (p's ≤ 0.024). Obese patients with schizophrenia had significantly lower scores than normal weight patients on the Trail Making Test B, the WMS-R Visual Reproduction subscale, the WAIS Digit Symbol subscale, and the composite z score (p's ≤ 0.004). Conclusions: Our study suggests that, in addition to its well established risk for various cardiometabolic conditions, obesity is also associated with decreased cognitive function in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Future studies should explore if weight loss and management can improve cognitive function in obese patients who suffer from schizophrenia."
23569398,"Patient safety in orthopedic surgery: prioritizing key areas of iatrogenic harm through an analysis of 48,095 incidents reported to a national database of errors",Sukhmeet S Panesar,"Background: With scientific and technological advances, the practice of orthopedic surgery has transformed the lives of millions worldwide. Such successes however have a downside; not only is the provision of comprehensive orthopedic care becoming a fiscal challenge to policy-makers and funders, concerns are also being raised about the extent of the associated iatrogenic harm. The National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) in England and Wales is an underused resource which collects intelligence from reports about health care error. Methods: Using methods akin to case-control methodology, we have identified a method of prioritizing the areas of a national database of errors that have the greatest propensity for harm. Our findings are presented using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: The largest proportion of surgical patient safety incidents reported to the NRLS was from the trauma and orthopedics specialty, 48,095/163,595 (29.4%). Of those, 14,482/48,095 (30.1%) resulted in iatrogenic harm to the patient and 71/48,095 (0.15%) resulted in death. The leading types of errors associated with harm involved the implementation of care and on-going monitoring (OR 5.94, 95% CI 5.53, 6.38); self-harming behavior of patients in hospitals (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.45, 3.18); and infection control (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.69, 2.17). We analyze these data to quantify the extent and type of iatrogenic harm in the specialty, and make suggestions on the way forward. CONCLUSION AND LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Despite the limitations of such analyses, it is clear that there are many proven interventions which can improve patient safety and need to be implemented. Avoidable errors must be prevented, lest we be accused of contravening our fundamental duty of primum non nocere. This is a level III evidence-based study."
23566888,The association between sleep spindles and IQ in healthy school-age children,Reut Gruber,"Recent studies have suggested that sleep is associated with IQ measures in children, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. An association between sleep spindles and IQ has been found in adults, but only two previous studies have explored this topic in children. The goal of this study was to examine whether sleep spindle frequency, amplitude, duration and/or density were associated with performance on the perceptual reasoning, verbal comprehension, working memory, and processing speed subscales of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV). We recruited 29 typically developing children 7-11 years of age. We used portable polysomnography to document sleep architecture in the natural home environment and evaluated IQ. We found that lower sleep spindle frequency was associated with better performance on the perceptual reasoning and working memory WISC-IV scales, but that sleep spindle amplitude, duration and density were not associated with performance on the IQ test."
23565603,Amoeba-inspired nanoarchitectonic computing: solving intractable computational problems using nanoscale photoexcitation transfer dynamics,Masashi Aono,"Biologically inspired computing devices and architectures are expected to overcome the limitations of conventional technologies in terms of solving computationally demanding problems, adapting to complex environments, reducing energy consumption, and so on. We previously demonstrated that a primitive single-celled amoeba (a plasmodial slime mold), which exhibits complex spatiotemporal oscillatory dynamics and sophisticated computing capabilities, can be used to search for a solution to a very hard combinatorial optimization problem. We successfully extracted the essential spatiotemporal dynamics by which the amoeba solves the problem. This amoeba-inspired computing paradigm can be implemented by various physical systems that exhibit suitable spatiotemporal dynamics resembling the amoeba's problem-solving process. In this Article, we demonstrate that photoexcitation transfer phenomena in certain quantum nanostructures mediated by optical near-field interactions generate the amoebalike spatiotemporal dynamics and can be used to solve the satisfiability problem (SAT), which is the problem of judging whether a given logical proposition (a Boolean formula) is self-consistent. SAT is related to diverse application problems in artificial intelligence, information security, and bioinformatics and is a crucially important nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-complete problem, which is believed to become intractable for conventional digital computers when the problem size increases. We show that our amoeba-inspired computing paradigm dramatically outperforms a conventional stochastic search method. These results indicate the potential for developing highly versatile nanoarchitectonic computers that realize powerful solution searching with low energy consumption."
23565267,Tone language speakers and musicians share enhanced perceptual and cognitive abilities for musical pitch: evidence for bidirectionality between the domains of language and music,Gavin M Bidelman,"Psychophysiological evidence suggests that music and language are intimately coupled such that experience/training in one domain can influence processing required in the other domain. While the influence of music on language processing is now well-documented, evidence of language-to-music effects have yet to be firmly established. Here, using a cross-sectional design, we compared the performance of musicians to that of tone-language (Cantonese) speakers on tasks of auditory pitch acuity, music perception, and general cognitive ability (e.g., fluid intelligence, working memory). While musicians demonstrated superior performance on all auditory measures, comparable perceptual enhancements were observed for Cantonese participants, relative to English-speaking nonmusicians. These results provide evidence that tone-language background is associated with higher auditory perceptual performance for music listening. Musicians and Cantonese speakers also showed superior working memory capacity relative to nonmusician controls, suggesting that in addition to basic perceptual enhancements, tone-language background and music training might also be associated with enhanced general cognitive abilities. Our findings support the notion that tone language speakers and musically trained individuals have higher performance than English-speaking listeners for the perceptual-cognitive processing necessary for basic auditory as well as complex music perception. These results illustrate bidirectional influences between the domains of music and language."
23565138,First genome-wide association study on anxiety-related behaviours in childhood,Maciej Trzaskowski,"Background: Twin studies have shown that anxiety in a general population sample of children involves both domain-general and trait-specific genetic effects. For this reason, in an attempt to identify genes responsible for these effects, we investigated domain-general and trait-specific genetic associations in the first genome-wide association (GWA) study on anxiety-related behaviours (ARBs) in childhood. Methods: The sample included 2810 7-year-olds drawn from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) with data available for parent-rated anxiety and genome-wide DNA markers. The measure was the Anxiety-Related Behaviours Questionnaire (ARBQ), which assesses four anxiety traits and also yields a general anxiety composite. Affymetrix GeneChip 6.0 DNA arrays were used to genotype nearly 700,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and IMPUTE v2 was used to impute more than 1 million SNPs. Several GWA associations from this discovery sample were followed up in another TEDS sample of 4804 children. In addition, Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) was used on the discovery sample, to estimate the total amount of variance in ARBs that can be accounted for by SNPs on the array. Results: No SNP associations met the demanding criterion of genome-wide significance that corrects for multiple testing across the genome (p<5×10(-8)). Attempts to replicate the top associations did not yield significant results. In contrast to the substantial twin study estimates of heritability which ranged from 0.50 (0.03) to 0.61 (0.01), the GCTA estimates of phenotypic variance accounted for by the SNPs were much lower 0.01 (0.11) to 0.19 (0.12). Conclusions: Taken together, these GWAS and GCTA results suggest that anxiety--similar to height, weight and intelligence--is affected by many genetic variants of small effect, but unlike these other prototypical polygenic traits, genetic influence on anxiety is not well tagged by common SNPs."
23565100,A canonical theory of dynamic decision-making,John Fox,"Decision-making behavior is studied in many very different fields, from medicine and economics to psychology and neuroscience, with major contributions from mathematics and statistics, computer science, AI, and other technical disciplines. However the conceptualization of what decision-making is and methods for studying it vary greatly and this has resulted in fragmentation of the field. A theory that can accommodate various perspectives may facilitate interdisciplinary working. We present such a theory in which decision-making is articulated as a set of canonical functions that are sufficiently general to accommodate diverse viewpoints, yet sufficiently precise that they can be instantiated in different ways for specific theoretical or practical purposes. The canons cover the whole decision cycle, from the framing of a decision based on the goals, beliefs, and background knowledge of the decision-maker to the formulation of decision options, establishing preferences over them, and making commitments. Commitments can lead to the initiation of new decisions and any step in the cycle can incorporate reasoning about previous decisions and the rationales for them, and lead to revising or abandoning existing commitments. The theory situates decision-making with respect to other high-level cognitive capabilities like problem solving, planning, and collaborative decision-making. The canonical approach is assessed in three domains: cognitive and neuropsychology, artificial intelligence, and decision engineering."
23562503,Reduced efficiency of functional brain network underlying intellectual decline in patients with low-grade glioma,Huazhong Xu,"Low-grade glioma (LGG) patients are typically accompanied by varying degrees of intellectual impairments. However, the neural mechanisms underlying intellectual decline have not yet been well understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between possibly altered functional brain network properties and intellectual decline in LGG patients. Chinese revised Wechsler adult intelligence scale (WAIS-RC) was used to assess the intelligence of 21 LGG patients and 20 healthy controls, matched in age, gender and education. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed for all the subjects to analyze functional network characteristics with graph theory. The LGG patients showed significantly poor performance on intelligence test than controls (P<0.05). Compared with controls, the patients displayed disturbed small-world manner (increased characteristic path length L and normalized characteristic path length λ) and decreased global efficiency Eglob. Specially, we found that Eglob was positively correlated with intelligence quotient (IQ) test scores in LGG group. Furthermore, network hubs, which could significantly affect the network efficiency, were in the right insula and right posterior cingulate cortex in controls, while in the right thalamus and right posterior cingulate cortex in the patients. From the perspective of brain network, our results provided evidence of reduced global efficiency for poorer intellectual performance in LGG patients, which contributed to understanding the basis of intellectual impairments."
23562357,Neurocognitive function in HIV-positive children in a developing country,S Y Walker,"Objectives: We aimed to characterize neurological outcomes and determine the prevalence of HIV encephalopathy in a cohort of HIV-infected children in Jamaica. Methods: Data for 287 HIV-infected children presenting between 2002 and 2008 were reviewed and neurological outcomes characterized. A nested case-control study was conducted between July and September 2009 used 15 randomly selected encephalopathic HIV-infected children aged 7-10 years and 15 matched controls (non-encephalopathic HIV-infected). Their neurocognitive functions were evaluated using clinical assessment and standardized tests for intelligence, short term memory (visuo-spatial and auditory), selective attention, and fine motor and coordination functions. Outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test and the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results: Sixty-seven (23.3%) children were encephalopathic. The median age at diagnosis of HIV encephalopathy was 1.6 years (interquartile range (IQR) 1.1-3.4 years). Predominant abnormalities were delayed milestones (59, 88.1%), hyperreflexia (59, 86.5%), spasticity (50, 74.6%), microcephaly (42, 61.7%), and quadriparesis (21, 31.3%). The median age of tested children was 8.7 years (IQR 7.6-10.8 years) in the encephalopathic group and 9 years (IQR 7.4-10.7 years) in the non-encephalopathic group. Encephalopathic children performed worse in all domains of neurocognitive function (p<0.05). Conclusions: A high prevalence of HIV encephalopathy was noted, and significant neurocognitive dysfunction identified in encephalopathic children. Optimized management through the early identification of neurological impairment and implementation of appropriate interventions is recommended to improve quality of life."
23561717,Tract-based spatial statistics reveal altered relationship between non-verbal reasoning abilities and white matter integrity in autism spectrum disorder,Timothy M Ellmore,"Altered brain connectivity accompanies autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but the relationship between connectivity and intellectual abilities, which often differs within ASD, and between ASD and typically developing (TD) children, is not understood. Here, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to explore the relationship between white matter integrity and non-verbal intelligence quotients (IQ) in children with ASD and in age- and gender-matched TD children. Tract-based spatial statistical analyses (TBSS) of DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) revealed altered relationships between white matter and IQ. Different relationships were found using within-group analyses, where regions of significant (p < .05, corrected) correlations in ASD overlapped minimally with regions of FA-IQ correlations in TD subjects. An additional between-groups analysis revealed significant correlation differences in widespread cortical and subcortical areas. These preliminary findings suggest altered brain connectivity may underlie some differences in intellectual abilities of ASD, and should be investigated further in larger samples as a function of development."
23560667,Are stepfathers' education levels associated with the intelligence of their stepsons? A register-based study of Norwegian half-brothers,Willy Eriksen,"We examined the relationship between the parents' education levels and the adult intelligence of their children in a population-based, nationwide sample of Norwegian half-brothers with different fathers (2,016 pairs of half-brothers). In a family where the mother has two children with different men, the firstborn child usually lives with the younger child's father during a period of their childhood. This makes it possible to study the non-genetic effects of paternal education on children's development. Results showed that the education level of the younger half-brother's father was positively associated with the intelligence score of the older half-brother. The education level of the older half-brother's father was not associated with the intelligence score of the younger half-brother. Firstborn men whose half-brothers' fathers had high levels of education had intelligence scores that were 33% (95% confidence interval: 18-47%) of a standard deviation higher than those of firstborn men whose half-brothers' fathers had low levels of education, after adjustment for the biological fathers' education levels, mothers' education levels, and other background factors. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that a child's family environment exerts an effect on the cognitive abilities of the child that lasts into adulthood."
23558736,Executive functioning in children with unilateral cerebral palsy: protocol for a cross-sectional study,Harriet L Bodimeade,"Introduction: Early brain injury, as found in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP), may cause deficits in higher-order cognitive tasks known as executive functions (EF). EF has been conceptualised as comprised of four distinct yet inter-related components: (1) attentional control, (2) cognitive flexibility, (3) goal setting and (4) information processing. The aim of this study was to examine EF in children with unilateral CP and compare their performance with a typically developing reference group (TDC). The potential laterality effects of unilateral CP on EF will be explored, as will the relationship between the cognitive measures of EF, behavioural manifestations of EF, psychological functioning and clinical features of unilateral CP. Methods and analysis: This cross-sectional study aims to recruit a total of 42 children with unilateral CP (21 right unilateral CP and 21 left unilateral CP) and 21 TDC aged between 8 and 16 years. Clinical severity will be described for gross motor function and manual ability. Outcomes for cognitive EF measureswill include subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, Rey Complex Figure Test and the Test of Everyday Attention for Children. Behavioural manifestations of EF will be assessed using the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Parent and Teacher versions. Psychological functioning will be examined using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Between-groups differences will be examined in a series of one-way analyses of covariance and followed up using linear comparisons. An overall composite of cognitive EF measures will be created. Bivariate correlations between the EF composite and psychological measures will be calculated. Ethics and dissemination: This protocol describes a study that, to our knowledge, is the first to examine multiple components of EF using a cohort of children with unilateral CP. Exploration of potential laterality effects of EF among children with a congenital, unilateral brain injury is also novel. Possible relationships between EF and psychological functioning will also be investigated. Ethics have been obtained through the University of Queensland School of Psychology Ethics Committee and the Queensland Children's Health Services Human Research Ethics Committee. Results will be disseminated in peer reviewed publications and presentations at national and international conferences. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12611000263998)."
23558100,Genetic influences on prefrontal activation during a verbal fluency task in adults: a twin study based on multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy,Eisuke Sakakibara,"Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) studies have reported that prefrontal hemodynamic dysfunction during executive function tasks may be a promising biomarker of psychiatric disorders, because its portability and noninvasiveness allow easy measurements in clinical settings. Here, we investigated the degree to which prefrontal NIRS signals are genetically determined. Using a 52-channel NIRS system, we monitored the oxy-hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) signal changes in 38 adult pairs of right-handed monozygotic (MZ) twins and 13 pairs of same-sex right-handed dizygotic (DZ) twins during a letter version of the verbal fluency task. Heritability was estimated based on a classical twin paradigm using structured equation modeling. Significant genetic influences were estimated in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left frontal pole. The degrees of heritability were 66% and 75% in the variances, respectively. This implies that the prefrontal hemodynamic dysfunction observed during an executive function task measured by NIRS may be an efficient endophenotype for large-scale imaging genetic studies in psychiatric disorders."
23557429,Neurocognitive profiles in treatment-resistant bipolar I and bipolar II disorder depression,Ute Kessler,"Background: The literature on the neuropsychological profiles in Bipolar disorder (BD) depression is sparse. The aims of the study were to assess the neurocognitive profiles in treatment-resistant, acutely admitted BD depression inpatients, to compare the neurocognitive functioning in patients with BD I and II, and to identify the demographic and clinical illness characteristics associated with cognitive functioning. Methods: Acutely admitted BD I (n = 19) and BD II (n = 32) inpatients who fulfilled the DSM-IV-TR criteria for a major depressive episode were tested with the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, the National Adult Reading Test, and a battery of clinical measures. Results: Neurocognitive impairments were evident in the BD I and BD II depression inpatients within all MCCB domains. The numerical scores on all MCCB-measures were lower in the BD I group than in the BD II group, with a significant difference on one of the measures, category fluency. 68.4% of the BD I patients had clinically significant impairment (>1.5 SD below normal mean) in two or more domains compared to 37.5% of the BD II patients (p = 0.045). A significant reduction in IQ from the premorbid to the current level was seen in BD I but not BD II patients. Higher age was associated with greater neurocognitive deficits compared to age-adjusted published norms. Conclusions: A high proportion of patients with therapy-resistant BD I or II depression exhibited global neurocognitive impairments with clinically significant severity. The cognitive impairments were more common in BD I compared to BD II patients, particularly processing speed. These findings suggest that clinicians should be aware of the severe neurocognitive dysfunction in treatment-resistant bipolar depression, particularly in BD I. Trial registration: NCT00664976."
23555894,Estimating premorbid cognitive abilities in low-educated populations,Daniel Apolinario,"Objective: To develop an informant-based instrument that would provide a valid estimate of premorbid cognitive abilities in low-educated populations. Methods: A questionnaire was drafted by focusing on the premorbid period with a 10-year time frame. The initial pool of items was submitted to classical test theory and a factorial analysis. The resulting instrument, named the Premorbid Cognitive Abilities Scale (PCAS), is composed of questions addressing educational attainment, major lifetime occupation, reading abilities, reading habits, writing abilities, calculation abilities, use of widely available technology, and the ability to search for specific information. The validation sample was composed of 132 older Brazilian adults from the following three demographically matched groups: normal cognitive aging (n = 72), mild cognitive impairment (n = 33), and mild dementia (n = 27). The scores of a reading test and a neuropsychological battery were adopted as construct criteria. Post-mortem inter-informant reliability was tested in a sub-study with two relatives from each deceased individual. Results: All items presented good discriminative power, with corrected item-total correlation varying from 0.35 to 0.74. The summed score of the instrument presented high correlation coefficients with global cognitive function (r = 0.73) and reading skills (r = 0.82). Cronbach's alpha was 0.90, showing optimal internal consistency without redundancy. The scores did not decrease across the progressive levels of cognitive impairment, suggesting that the goal of evaluating the premorbid state was achieved. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.96, indicating excellent inter-informant reliability. Conclusion: The instrument developed in this study has shown good properties and can be used as a valid estimate of premorbid cognitive abilities in low-educated populations. The applicability of the PCAS, both as an estimate of premorbid intelligence and cognitive reserve, is discussed."
23554200,Impact of routine real-time PCR testing of imported malaria over 4 years of implementation in a clinical laboratory,Sandra Shokoples,"In clinical laboratories, diagnosis of imported malaria is commonly performed by microscopy. However, the volume of specimens is generally low and maintaining proficiency in reading blood smears, particularly at the species level, is challenging in this setting. To address this problem, the Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (ProvLab) in Alberta, Canada, implemented real-time PCR for routine confirmation of all smear-positive samples in the province. Here we report our experience over a 4-year period (2008 to 2012) with this new diagnostic algorithm. While detection of Plasmodium falciparum by microscopy alone was accurate, real-time PCR served as an important adjunct to microscopy for the identification of non-falciparum species. In 18% of cases, the result was reported as non-falciparum or the species could not be identified by microscopy alone, and in all cases, the species was resolved by real-time PCR. In another 4% of cases, the species was misidentified by microscopy. To enhance surveillance for malaria, we integrated our demographic, clinical, and laboratory data into a new system developed by the Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence, called the Malaria System for Online Surveillance (SOS). Using this application, we characterized our patient populations and travel history to identify risk factors associated with malaria infection abroad."
23552443,Effect of cognitive reserve markers on Alzheimer pathologic progression,Raymond Y Lo,"Education, occupation, premorbid intelligence, and brain size are surrogate markers for cognitive reserve. Whether these markers have biological influence on Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology is not known. We thus aimed to investigate the effect of cognitive reserve proxies on longitudinal change of AD biomarkers. A total of 819 participants with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and mild AD were enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and followed up with repeated measures of cerebrospinal fluid, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess whether biomarker rates of change were modified by reserve proxies. Cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42 decline was slower in normal cognition participants with higher cognitive reserve indexed by education, occupation, and American National Adult Reading Test (ANART). The decline of [F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography uptake was slower in AD participants with better performance on the ANART. Education, occupation, and ANART did not modify the rates of magnetic resonance imaging hippocampal atrophy in any group. These findings remained unchanged after accounting for APOE 4, longitudinal missing data, and baseline cognitive performance. Higher levels of reserve markers may slow the rate of amyloid deposition before cognitive impairment and preserve glucose metabolism at the dementia stage over the course of AD pathologic progression."
23551975,Intelligence and psychopathy: a correlational study on insane female offenders,C Spironelli,"Background: The occurrence of a significant relationship between psychopathic traits and intelligence is still open to debate. Most of the relevant information has been obtained from crystallized IQ tests or on psychopathic male offenders. In this study we hypothesized a negative correlation between psychopathic traits and fluid intelligence on a sample of criminal female in-patients. Method: We carried out a correlational study on a selected sample of 56 criminal female offenders. Variables that were measured include the Hare Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R) total score (and, separately, the scores from its four subscales: Interpersonal, Affective, Lifestyle and Antisocial) and fluid IQ measured by Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). Results: Pearson's correlation between RPM IQ and total PCL-R score was negative (r(54) = -0.55, p < 0.001); women with greater psychopathy traits (total PCL-R score) had lower IQ scores. Negative correlations were also found between IQ and the four PCL-R subscales, Interpersonal, Affective, Lifestyle and Antisocial (r(54) = -0.35, p < 0.01, r(54) = -0.52, p < 0.001, r(54) = -0.53, p < 0.001, and r(54) = -0.49, p < 0.001 respectively). Conclusions: The results indicate a general negative relationship between PCL-R and IQ, equally distributed across the four subcomponents of the psychopathic trait, and support the view that unsuccessful psychopathic women have poor planning and are unable to foresee and represent future consequences of their actions."
23551406,Intelligence or years of education: which is better correlated with memory function in normal elderly Japanese subjects?,Norio Murayama,"Background: We compared differences in intelligence and memory function between normal elderly Japanese subjects with more years of education and those with fewer years of education. We also investigated clinical and neuropsychological factors that are strongly correlated with memory function. Methods: There were 118 normal elderly subjects who underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition (WAIS-III), and Wechsler Memory Scale Revised. Subjects with at least 13 years of education were categorized as the H group, and those with 12 years of education or less were categorized as the L group. Results: Age and Mini-Mental State Examination scores were not significantly different between the two groups. On the WAIS-III, there were significant differences between the two groups in Verbal IQ and Full Scale IQ. On the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised, there were significant differences between the two groups in Visual Memory, General Memory, and Delayed Recall. Correlation coefficients between memory function and the other factors demonstrated significant but weak correlations between years of education and General Memory (R = 0.22) and between years of education and Delayed Recall (R = 0.20). Strong correlations were found between Verbal IQ and Verbal Memory (R = 0.45), between Verbal IQ and General Memory (R = 0.49), between Full Scale IQ and General Memory (R = 0.50) and between Full Scale IQ and Delayed Recall (R = 0.48). Conclusions: In normal elderly Japanese subjects, years of education weakly correlated with memory function while Verbal IQ, Full Scale IQ and Verbal Comprehension on WAIS-III had stronger correlations with memory function. Verbal IQ and Verbal Comprehension on WAIS-III were found to be insusceptible to the cognitive decline characteristic of Alzheimer's disease or amnestic mild cognitive impairment. Therefore, verbal intelligence, as measured by Verbal IQ and Verbal Comprehension, may be the most useful factor for inferring premorbid memory function in Alzheimer's disease or amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients."

23548024,"MIANN models in medicinal, physical and organic chemistry",Humberto González-Díaz,"Reducing costs in terms of time, animal sacrifice, and material resources with computational methods has become a promising goal in Medicinal, Biological, Physical and Organic Chemistry. There are many computational techniques that can be used in this sense. In any case, almost all these methods focus on few fundamental aspects including: type (1) methods to quantify the molecular structure, type (2) methods to link the structure with the biological activity, and others. In particular, MARCH-INSIDE (MI), acronym for Markov Chain Invariants for Networks Simulation and Design, is a well-known method for QSAR analysis useful in step (1). In addition, the bio-inspired Artificial-Intelligence (AI) algorithms called Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are among the most powerful type (2) methods. We can combine MI with ANNs in order to seek QSAR models, a strategy which is called herein MIANN (MI & ANN models). One of the first applications of the MIANN strategy was in the development of new QSAR models for drug discovery. MIANN strategy has been expanded to the QSAR study of proteins, protein-drug interactions, and protein-protein interaction networks. In this paper, we review for the first time many interesting aspects of the MIANN strategy including theoretical basis, implementation in web servers, and examples of applications in Medicinal and Biological chemistry. We also report new applications of the MIANN strategy in Medicinal chemistry and the first examples in Physical and Organic Chemistry, as well. In so doing, we developed new MIANN models for several self-assembly physicochemical properties of surfactants and large reaction networks in organic synthesis. In some of the new examples we also present experimental results which were not published up to date."
23548021,Ontologies in medicinal chemistry: current status and future challenges,Asunción Gómez-Pérez,"Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the amount and availability of data in the diverse areas of medicinal chemistry, making it possible to achieve significant advances in fields such as the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of compounds. However, with this data explosion, the storage, management and analysis of available data to extract relevant information has become even a more complex task that offers challenging research issues to Artificial Intelligence (AI) scientists. Ontologies have emerged in AI as a key tool to formally represent and semantically organize aspects of the real world. Beyond glossaries or thesauri, ontologies facilitate communication between experts and allow the application of computational techniques to extract useful information from available data. In medicinal chemistry, multiple ontologies have been developed during the last years which contain knowledge about chemical compounds and processes of synthesis of pharmaceutical products. This article reviews the principal standards and ontologies in medicinal chemistry, analyzes their main applications and suggests future directions."
23546984,Effect of chromosome constitution variations on the expression of Turner phenotype,A V S Bispo,"Turner syndrome (TS) is a chronic disease related to haploinsufficiency of genes that are normally expressed in both X chromosomes in patients with female phenotype that is associated with a wide range of somatic malformations. We made detailed cytogenetic and clinical analysis of 65 patients with TS from the region of Recife, Brazil, to determine the effects of different chromosome constitutions on expression of the TS phenotype. Overall, patients with X-monosomy exhibited a tendency to have more severe phenotypes with higher morbidity, showing its importance in TS prognosis. Additionally, we found rare genetic and phenotypic abnormalities associated with this syndrome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of 45,X,t(11;12)(q22;q22) described as a TS karyotype. Turner patients usually have normal intelligence; however, moderate to severe levels of mental retardation were found in 5 TS cases, which is considerate a very uncommon feature in this syndrome."
23545607,Idiopathic (primary) generalized epilepsy. Traditional versus new antiepileptic drugs,Samira Yadegari,"Idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) are genetic based seizures with normal neurologic exam, intelligence, and imaging studies. Based on the age of onset and prominent seizure type, different syndromes were identified. The purpose of this study is to summarize the characteristics, prognosis, and choices of antiepileptic drugs (AED) in common syndromes of IGE. In addition, we review the updated role of new AEDs in specific syndromes of IGE. The first choice AED is usually valproate. Most drug trials on the effects of new AEDs compared them with placebo and not valproate. However, some of the broad spectrum new AEDs may be considered as the first choice in specific conditions. In true refractory patients, combination therapy and vagal nerve stimulation could be the next option. In the proper management of IGE, neurologists should consider the predominant seizure type, patient gender, co-morbidities, and antiepileptic drugs that may aggravate a specific seizure type."
23545476,Nanopsychiatry. The potential role of nanotechnologies in the future of psychiatry. A systematic review],G Fond,"Introduction: Nanomedicine is defined as the area using nanotechnology's concepts for the benefit of human beings, their health and well being. The field of nanotechnology opened new unsuspected fields of research a few years ago. Aim of the study: To provide an overview of nanotechnology application areas that could affect care for psychiatric illnesses. Methods: We conducted a systematic review using the PRISMA criteria (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis). Inclusion criteria were specified in advance: all studies describing the development of nanotechnology in psychiatry. The research paradigm was: ""(nanotechnology OR nanoparticles OR nanomedicine) AND (central nervous system)"" Articles were identified in three research bases, Medline (1966-present), Web of Science (1975-present) and Cochrane (all articles). The last search was carried out on April 2, 2012. Seventy-six items were included in this qualitative review. Results: The main applications of nanotechnology in psychiatry are (i) pharmacology. There are two main difficulties in neuropharmacology. Drugs have to pass the blood brain barrier and then to be internalized by targeted cells. Nanoparticles could increase drugs' bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, especially improving safety and efficacy of psychotropic drugs. Liposomes, nanosomes, nanoparticle polymers, nanobubbles are some examples of this targeted drug delivery. Nanotechnologies could also add new pharmacological properties, like nanohells and dendrimers; (ii) living analysis. Nanotechnology provides technical assistance to in vivo imaging or metabolome analysis; (iii) central nervous system modeling. Research teams have modelized inorganic synapses and mimicked synaptic behavior, essential for further creation of artificial neural systems. Some nanoparticle assemblies present the same small world and free-scale network architecture as cortical neural networks. Nanotechnologies and quantum physics could be used to create models of artificial intelligence and mental illnesses. Discussion: Even if nanotechnologies are promising, their safety is still tricky and this must be kept in mind. Conclusion: We are not about to see a concrete application of nanomedicine in daily psychiatric practice. However, it seems essential that psychiatrists do not forsake this area of research the perspectives of which could be decisive in the field of mental illness."
23545248,Ambient intelligence for monitoring and research in clinical neurophysiology and medicine: the MIMERICA* project and prototype,L Pignolo,"Ambient Intelligence (AmI) provides extended but unobtrusive sensing and computing devices and ubiquitous networking for human/environment interaction. It is a new paradigm in information technology compliant with the international Integrating Healthcare Enterprise board (IHE) and eHealth HL7 technological standards in the functional integration of biomedical domotics and informatics in hospital and home care. AmI allows real-time automatic recording of biological/medical information and environmental data. It is extensively applicable to patient monitoring, medicine and neuroscience research, which require large biomedical data sets; for example, in the study of spontaneous or condition-dependent variability or chronobiology. In this respect, AML is equivalent to a traditional laboratory for data collection and processing, with minimal dedicated equipment, staff, and costs; it benefits from the integration of artificial intelligence technology with traditional/innovative sensors to monitor clinical or functional parameters. A prototype AmI platform (MIMERICA*) has been implemented and is operated in a semi-intensive unit for the vegetative and minimally conscious states, to investigate the spontaneous or environment-related fluctuations of physiological parameters in these conditions."
23545096,Executive functioning and psychopathological profile in relatives of individuals with deficit v. non-deficit schizophrenia: a pilot study,S Scala,"Aims. Heterogeneity of schizophrenia is known to be reflected in neuropsychological functioning of patients, but its expression in relatives is understudied. This study aims at exploring relationship between executive functioning and clinical profiles of first-degree relatives of patients who are classified as having or not having the deficit subtype of schizophrenia (DSRELs v. non-DSRELs), with the prediction of greater executive impairment in DSRELs. Methods. DSRELs (n = 15) and non-DSRELs (n = 40) were compared with community controls (CCs, n = 55) on executive functioning measured by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the phonemic verbal fluency (PVF), and clinical measures. Effects of psychopathology and intelligence quotient (IQ) measures were investigated to determine their association with executive performance. Results. DSRELs showed more executive dysfunction on WCST and poorer social functioning than CCs and more severe negative symptoms than non-DSRELs. Differences on WCST-categories achieved (WCST-CA) remained significant after adjustment for clinical confounders and IQ. WCST-CA was associated with apathy and paranoid ideation only within the DSREL subgroup. Conclusions. Executive functioning and negative symptoms are severely impaired in first-degree relatives of deficit syndrome patients, thus suggesting that some neurocognitive deficits in patients may be transmitted within families according to the pathophysiology of the probands."
23545056,Individual treatment response in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: broadening perspectives and improving assessments,Paul Hodgkins,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly complex disorder with multiple treatment options. Impairments associated with ADHD, rather than symptoms defining the disorder, are the primary reason for referral of individuals to clinical services; consequently, they should also be key targets for intervention. Impairments are moderated by factors such as comorbidities, family environment and intelligence quotient, and particular challenges may vary between patients. The understanding of patient and family treatment preferences, as well as identification of treatment needs and goals, should drive future clinical practice. This review addresses the assessment of ADHD treatment goals and outcomes in clinical practice, and discusses changes in future clinical research studies necessary to progress the utilization of an individualized medicine approach in ADHD."
23544403,An independent confirmatory factor analysis of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-fourth Edition (WISC-IV) integrated: what do the process approach subtests measure?,Nicholas Benson,"The Wechsler intelligence scale for children--fourth edition (WISC-IV) Integrated contains the WISC-IV core and supplemental subtests along with process approach subtests designed to facilitate a process-oriented approach to score interpretation. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which WISC-IV Integrated subtests measure the constructs they are purported to measure. In addition to examining the measurement and scoring model provided in the manual, this study also tested hypotheses regarding Cattell-Horn-Carroll abilities that might be measured along with other substantive questions regarding the factor structure of the WISC-IV Integrated and the nature of abilities measured by process approach subtests. Results provide insight regarding the constructs measured by these subtests. Many subtests appear to be good to excellent measures of psychometric g (i.e., the general factor presumed to cause the positive correlation of mental tasks). Other abilities measured by subtests are described. For some subtests, the majority of variance is not accounted for by theoretical constructs included in the scoring model. Modifications made to remove demands such as memory recall and verbal expression were found to reduce construct-irrelevant variance. The WISC-IV Integrated subtests appear to measure similar constructs across ages 6-16, although strict factorial invariance was not supported."
23544395,Structural and incremental validity of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition with a clinical sample,Jason M Nelson,"Structural and incremental validity of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV; Wechsler, 2008a) was examined with a sample of 300 individuals referred for evaluation at a university-based clinic. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the WAIS-IV structure was best represented by 4 first-order factors as well as a general intelligence factor in a direct hierarchical model. The general intelligence factor accounted for the most common and total variance among the subtests. Incremental validity analyses indicated that the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) generally accounted for medium to large portions of academic achievement variance. For all measures of academic achievement, the first-order factors combined accounted for significant achievement variance beyond that accounted for by the FSIQ, but individual factor index scores contributed trivial amounts of achievement variance. Implications for interpreting WAIS-IV results are discussed."
23540273,The effect of age on fluid intelligence is fully mediated by physical health,Ingvar Bergman,"The present study investigated the extent to which the effect of age on cognitive ability is predicted by individual differences in physical health. The sample consisted of 118 volunteer subjects who were healthy and ranging in age from 26 to 91. The examinations included a clinical investigation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain neuroimaging, and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. The effect of age on fluid IQ with and without visual spatial praxis and on crystallized IQ was tested whether being fully-, partially- or non-mediated by physical health. Structural equation analyses showed that the best and most parsimonious fit to the data was provided by models that were fully mediated for fluid IQ without praxis, non-mediated for crystallized IQ and partially mediated for fluid IQ with praxis. The diseases of the circulatory and nervous systems were the major mediators. It was concluded from the pattern of findings that the effect of age on fluid intelligence is fully mediated by physical health, while crystallized intelligence is non-mediated and visual spatial praxis is partially mediated, influenced mainly by direct effects of age. Our findings imply that improving health by acting against the common age-related circulatory- and nervous system diseases and risk factors will oppose the decline in fluid intelligence with age."
23539519,The relationship between academic achievement and likelihood of police arrest among delinquents,Ilhong Yun,"Drawing upon a recent study on the association between low self-control and differential responses from the criminal justice system, this study examined whether academic performance, a construct linked to self-control, was also associated with the probability of police arrest. The result indicated that academic performance did have a statistically significant inverse association with the likelihood of police arrest, net of low self-control and delinquency."
23539325,Mapping the protective pathway of emotional intelligence in youth: From social cognition to smoking intentions,Lindsay R Duncan,"The purpose of this study was to test perceptions of the social consequences of smoking as a mediator of the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and intentions to smoke cigarettes among youth. Upper elementary school students (N = 255, Mage = 10.9 years, 49% male) completed measures of EI, verbal intelligence, smoking-related intentions, past behavior, and perceived social consequences. Mediation was tested using the Sobel test. Perceived social consequences was a marginally significant mediator of the impact of total EI on intentions to smoke (Z = 1.91, p = .057). Follow-up analyses showed that perceived social consequences significantly mediated the effect of 2 EI abilities on smoking intentions: using emotions (Z = 2.02, p = .043) and managing emotions (Z = 2.28, p = .023). The results indicate that the role of higher EI in deterring smoking among youth may be related to social processing ability (i.e., greater perceptions of the negative social consequences of smoking). These findings contribute to a growing body of research demonstrating that EI may reduce cigarette smoking among youth by influencing their social perceptions."
23538788,Cognitive functioning and depressive symptoms in adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease,Anu E Castaneda,"Aim: To investigate cognitive functioning and depressive symptoms in adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: A neuropsychological test battery, including subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised and III, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), Stroop Color-Word Test, and Trail Making Test, which assessed verbal and visual short- and long-term memory, processing speed, logical reasoning, verbal intelligence, attention, and executive functioning, was administered to 13- to 19-year-old patients with IBD (n = 34; active disease n = 20). Depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory. The findings were compared with peers with non-acute juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA; n = 23). Patients with coexisting psychiatric disorders were excluded. Results: The IBD group, especially patients in the acute phase, made more perseverative errors in the CVLT test that assessed verbal memory than the JIA group (6.0 ± 4.3 vs 3.3 ± 2.9, P < 0.01), but no other differences between the IBD and JIA groups were observed in the neuropsychological tests. The difference was close to statistical significance, even when glucocorticoid medication was controlled for (P < 0.052). The IBD group had more depressive symptoms than the JIA group (7.9 ± 7.6 vs 4.0 ± 4.0, P < 0.05). Approximately one third of the IBD group had at least mild depressive symptoms, and those with acute illness had the highest scores. However, depressive symptoms were not related to the difference in the verbal memory test (perseverative errors in the CVLT) between the IBD and JIA groups. Conclusion: Adolescents with acute IBD may have mild verbal memory problems but no major cognitive deficits compared to peers with JIA."
23538568,Executive function in nephropathic cystinosis,Angela O Ballantyne,"Objective: We studied executive function (EF) in children and adolescents with cystinosis. Background: Cystinosis is a genetic metabolic disorder in which the amino acid cystine accumulates in all organs of the body, including the brain. Previous research has shown that individuals with cystinosis have visuospatial deficits, but normal intelligence and intact verbal abilities. Better understanding of the behavioral phenotype associated with cystinosis could have important implications for treatment. Methods: Twenty-eight children with cystinosis and 24 control participants (age range 8 to 17 years) underwent selected Delis-Kaplan executive function system tests for neuropsychological assessment of EF, and the participants' parents completed the behavior rating inventory of executive function. Results: Participants with cystinosis performed significantly more poorly than controls on all Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System indices examined and on the behavior rating inventory of executive function metacognition index and global executive composite. Conclusions: EF is an area of potential risk in cystinosis. Our data have implications not only for the function of affected children and adolescents in school and daily life, but also for disease management and treatment adherence. Our findings can aid in the design and implementation of interventions and lead to a greater understanding of brain-behavior relationships in cystinosis."
23537359,Definition of intellectual disability in criminal court cases,J Gregory Olley,"Definitions and associated descriptions of the condition now commonly known as intellectual disability serve many functions. The Atkins v. Virginia U.S. Supreme Court decision (2002) has called attention to the importance of clear, objective, and measureable wording of the definition. This article discusses the potential for misunderstanding and misinterpretation of such words as ability and cognitive, the importance of clarifying the role of measurement error and sociocultural factors, and the noncausal relationship between impairment in intelligence and adaptive behavior."
23537129,Emotional intelligence and academic performance in first and final year medical students: a cross-sectional study,Boon How Chew,"Background: Research on emotional intelligence (EI) suggests that it is associated with more pro-social behavior, better academic performance and improved empathy towards patients. In medical education and clinical practice, EI has been related to higher academic achievement and improved doctor-patient relationships. This study examined the effect of EI on academic performance in first- and final-year medical students in Malaysia. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study using an objectively-scored measure of EI, the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). Academic performance of medical school students was measured using continuous assessment (CA) and final examination (FE) results. The first- and final-year students were invited to participate during their second semester. Students answered a paper-based demographic questionnaire and completed the online MSCEIT on their own. Relationships between the total MSCEIT score to academic performance were examined using multivariate analyses. Results: A total of 163 (84 year one and 79 year five) medical students participated (response rate of 66.0%). The gender and ethnic distribution were representative of the student population. The total EI score was a predictor of good overall CA (OR 1.01), a negative predictor of poor result in overall CA (OR 0.97), a predictor of the good overall FE result (OR 1.07) and was significantly related to the final-year FE marks (adjusted R(2) = 0.43). Conclusions: Medical students who were more emotionally intelligent performed better in both the continuous assessments and the final professional examination. Therefore, it is possible that emotional skill development may enhance medical students' academic performance."
23536991,Construct validity of the Italian version of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) v2.0,Antonietta Curci,"In 2 studies, we assessed the construct validity of the Italian version of the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) version 2.0. In Study 1, we administered the MSCEIT together with measures of crystallized and fluid intelligence, personality, and affect. In Study 2, we administered the MSCEIT together with indexes of dispositional coping, emotion regulation strategies, alexithymia, state-trait anxiety, depression, and depressive rumination. We evaluated the factorial structure of the MSCEIT with a confirmatory factor analysis model using data combined from Study 1 and 2. The results confirm that the MSCEIT Italian version satisfactorily discriminates emotional intelligence ability from crystallized and fluid intelligence, personality, and affect, and exhibits significant correlations with various psychological well-being criteria. Furthermore, data from both studies confirm that the factorial structure of MSCEIT is consistent with the theory on which it is based, although it was difficult to rule out alternative structures."
23535872,"The effect of preimplantation genetic screening on neurological, cognitive and behavioural development in 4-year-old children: follow-up of a RCT",P Schendelaar,"Study question: Does embryo biopsy inherent to preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) affect neurological, cognitive and behavioural development of 4-year-old children? Summary answer: PGS does not seem to affect neurological, cognitive and behavioural development of 4-year-old singletons; however, our data suggest that it may be associated with altered neurodevelopment in twins. What is known already: Evidence concerning the safety of PGS on neurodevelopmental outcome in offspring is scarce. The present study provides information on neurodevelopmental, cognitive and behavioural outcome of 4-year-old PGS offspring. Study design, size, duration: A prospective, assessor-blinded follow-up study of children born to women who participated in a multi-centre RCT on the effect of IVF with or without PGS. Participants/materials, setting, methods: At 4 years, 49 children (31 singletons, 9 sets of twins) born following IVF with PGS and 64 children (42 singletons, 11 sets of twins) born following IVF without PGS (controls) were assessed (post-natal attrition 18%). Neurological development was evaluated with the standardized, age-specific and sensitive neurological examination according to Hempel, resulting in a neurological optimality score (NOS), a fluency score and the rate of adverse neurological outcome. Primary outcome was the fluency score, as fluency of movements is easily reduced by subtle dysfunction of the brain. Cognitive development was evaluated with the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children; behavioural development was evaluated with the Child Behavior Checklist. The effect of PGS was analysed with a mixed effects model. Main results and the role of chance: Based on the intention to treat analysis, neurodevelopmental outcome of PGS children was similar to that of controls. However, additional analyses indicated that PGS affected neurodevelopmental outcome of twins in a different way than that of singletons. The fluency score of singletons born following PGS was similar to that of control singletons [mean values, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 12.2 (11.5;12.8) and 12.2 (11.6;12.8)], respectively, P = 0.977) that was also true for the other neurodevelopmental parameters. The fluency score of PGS twins was significantly lower than that of control twins [mean values, 95% CIs: 10.6 (9.8;11.3) and 12.3 (11.5;13.1)], respectively, P = 0.001); the same was true for the NOS. In addition, PGS in twins was associated with a higher sequential intelligence quotient score. On the other hand, other neurodevelopmental parameters were similar for PGS twins and control twins. Post hoc sample size calculation for the primary outcome parameter, the fluency score, indicated that the study groups, including the subgroups of singletons and twins, were adequately powered. Limitations, reasons for caution: We assessed singletons and twins who contributed to the generalizability of the study. A limitation of our study is the relative small size of our study groups and the selective dropout in both groups (dropouts PGS group: higher gestational age; control group: less well-educated parents). These preclude the conclusion that PGS per se is not associated with neurodevelopmental, cognitive and behavioural problems in singletons and the conclusion that PGS is associated with altered neurodevelopmental outcome in twins. Wider implications of the findings: The need for careful long-term monitoring of children born following embryo biopsy remains, as it is still applied in the form of PGD and it is still unknown whether embryo biopsy affects long-term neurodevelopmental outcome."
23534842,Adaptive behavior and later school achievement in children with early-onset epilepsy,Anne T Berg,"Aim: To determine whether early measures of adaptive behavior are predictive of later school difficulties and achievement in otherwise neurotypical (unimpaired) children with onset of epilepsy during the preschool years. Method: In a prospective cohort study, parents completed the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) for children who were aged 5 years or less at epilepsy diagnosis. Eight to 9 years later, the children were assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC), the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT), and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Associations of VABS scores with later WRAT and CBCL scores were tested. Results: A total of 108 neurotypical children (64 males, 44 females; mean age at testing 11 y 11 mo, SD 2 y) were studied. After adjustment for IQ and other factors, there was an increase of 0.15 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03-0.27 points; p=0.03) and 0.14 points (95% CI 0.0-0.28 points; p=0.05) in WRAT reading and spelling scores for each 1-point increment in the VABS communication score. Corresponding numbers for the VABS socialization score were 0.20 (95% CI 0.08-0.32; p=0.005) and 0.17 (95% CI 0.05-0.29; p=0.005). Conclusion: In neurotypical preschool children with epilepsy, early social and communication scores predict later school performance. These findings raise questions about opportunities for early identification and intervention for children at greatest risk."
23533615,Abstract spatial reasoning as an autistic strength,Jennifer L Stevenson,"Autistic individuals typically excel on spatial tests that measure abstract reasoning, such as the Block Design subtest on intelligence test batteries and the Raven's Progressive Matrices nonverbal test of intelligence. Such well-replicated findings suggest that abstract spatial processing is a relative and perhaps absolute strength of autistic individuals. However, previous studies have not systematically varied reasoning level--concrete vs. abstract--and test domain--spatial vs. numerical vs. verbal, which the current study did. Autistic participants (N = 72) and non-autistic participants (N = 72) completed a battery of 12 tests that varied by reasoning level (concrete vs. abstract) and domain (spatial vs. numerical vs. verbal). Autistic participants outperformed non-autistic participants on abstract spatial tests. Non-autistic participants did not outperform autistic participants on any of the three domains (spatial, numerical, and verbal) or at either of the two reasoning levels (concrete and abstract), suggesting similarity in abilities between autistic and non-autistic individuals, with abstract spatial reasoning as an autistic strength."
23532375,ERP evidence suggests executive dysfunction in ecstasy polydrug users,C A Roberts,"Background: Deficits in executive functions such as access to semantic/long-term memory have been shown in ecstasy users in previous research. Equally, there have been many reports of equivocal findings in this area. The current study sought to further investigate behavioural and electro-physiological measures of this executive function in ecstasy users. Method: Twenty ecstasy-polydrug users, 20 non-ecstasy-polydrug users and 20 drug-naïve controls were recruited. Participants completed background questionnaires about their drug use, sleep quality, fluid intelligence and mood state. Each individual also completed a semantic retrieval task whilst 64 channel Electroencephalography (EEG) measures were recorded. Results: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) revealed no between-group differences in behavioural performance on the task. Mixed ANOVA on event-related potential (ERP) components P2, N2 and P3 revealed significant between-group differences in the N2 component. Subsequent exploratory univariate ANOVAs on the N2 component revealed marginally significant between-group differences, generally showing greater negativity at occipito-parietal electrodes in ecstasy users compared to drug-naïve controls. Despite absence of behavioural differences, differences in N2 magnitude are evidence of abnormal executive functioning in ecstasy-polydrug users."
23531483,Who rises to the top? Early indicators,Harrison J Kell,"Youth identified before age 13 (N = 320) as having profound mathematical or verbal reasoning abilities (top 1 in 10,000) were tracked for nearly three decades. Their awards and creative accomplishments by age 38, in combination with specific details about their occupational responsibilities, illuminate the magnitude of their contribution and professional stature. Many have been entrusted with obligations and resources for making critical decisions about individual and organizational well-being. Their leadership positions in business, health care, law, the professoriate, and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) suggest that many are outstanding creators of modern culture, constituting a precious human-capital resource. Identifying truly profound human potential, and forecasting differential development within such populations, requires assessing multiple cognitive abilities and using atypical measurement procedures. This study illustrates how ultimate criteria may be aggregated and longitudinally sequenced to validate such measures."
23531204,Effects of impoverished environmental conditions on working memory performance,Pascale M J Engel de Abreu,"This cross-cultural study investigates the impact of background experience on four verbal and visuo-spatial working memory (WM) tasks. A total of 84 children from low-income families were recruited from the following groups: (1) Portuguese immigrant children from Luxembourg impoverished in terms of language experience; (2) Brazilian children deprived in terms of scholastic background; (3) Portuguese children from Portugal with no disadvantage in either scholastic or language background. Children were matched on age, gender, fluid intelligence, and socioeconomic status and completed four simple and complex span tasks of WM and a vocabulary measure. Results indicate that, despite large differences in their backgrounds and language abilities, the groups exhibited comparable performance on the visuo-spatial tasks dot matrix and odd-one-out and on the verbal simple span task digit recall. Group differences emerged on the verbal complex span task counting recall with children from Luxembourg and Portugal outperforming children from disadvantaged schools in Brazil. The study suggests that whereas contributions of prior knowledge to digit span, dot matrix, and odd-one-out are likely to be minimal, background experience can affect performance on counting recall. Implications for testing WM capacity in children growing up in poverty are discussed."
23530602,A Validated Seven-Subtest Short Form for the WAIS-IV,John E Meyers,"This study presents a short form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV; Wechsler, 2008 ) using the subtests (Block Design, Similarities, Digit Span, Arithmetic, Information, Coding, and Picture Completion) suggested by Ward ( 1990 ). These seven subtests were used to predict the full WAIS-IV Full-Scale IQ, as well as the Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed Index scores. Two different data sets were used: the first consisted of 70 subjects and the second consisted of 32 subjects. The first data set was used to create a linear regression and the second data set was used to validate the results and compare to the prorated score method from the WAIS-IV manual. The prorated estimated scores correlated significantly with their counterparts and proved to be a better method of estimating the Full-Scale IQ and most of the index scores, but the regression equation was better at predicting the Processing Speed Index. The current study is consistent with the Ward ( 1990 ) and Pilgrim, Meyers, Bayless, & Whetstone (1999) studies and represents a reliable and valid way of assessing intellectual functioning in an abbreviated format."
23527993,Occupational outcome in bipolar disorder is not predicted by premorbid functioning and intelligence,Helle K Schoeyen,"Objectives: Bipolar disorder (BD), over the long term, can manifest a variety of outcomes depending on a number of different conditions. There is a need for further knowledge regarding preventive factors as well as predictors of the disabling course of the disorder. Studies regarding the impact on functional outcome of premorbid and current general intellectual function [intelligence quotient (IQ)] and premorbid functioning in BD patients are sparse. The present study addressed the role of premorbid functioning [assessed with the Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS)], intelligence, course of illness, and sociodemographics on occupational outcome in BD. Methods: Bipolar disorder patients were recruited consecutively from psychiatric units (outpatient and inpatient) in four major hospitals in Oslo, Norway [(N = 226: 64.4% bipolar I disorder (BD-I); 30.1% bipolar II disorder (BD-II); 5.5% bipolar disorder not otherwise specified (BD-NOS); 38.6% males]. The associations between current IQ, premorbid IQ [assessed using the National Adult Reading Test (NART)], PAS, clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, and receipt of disability benefit were analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses. Results: The number of hospitalizations for depressive episodes and illness duration was associated with a higher risk of receipt of disability benefit. PAS, premorbid and current IQ, as well as decline in IQ, did not explain the higher risk of receipt of disability benefits. Conclusions: Severe clinical course of BD was associated with receipt of disability benefit. Occupational outcome was unrelated to PAS, premorbid and current IQ, as well as decline in IQ. This suggests that the persistence of severe clinical symptoms, rather than global cognitive functioning, determines occupational outcome in BD and emphasizes the protective potential of early and continuous clinical treatment."
23527650,The relationship between working memory capacity and broad measures of cognitive ability in healthy adults and people with schizophrenia,Melissa K Johnson,"Objective: Working memory (WM) capacity, typically measured with cognitively complex span tasks, is correlated with higher order cognitive abilities in healthy adults. The goals of this study were to determine whether a more focused measure of visual WM storage capacity would show similar higher order ability correlations in healthy adults and in people with schizophrenia (PSZ), thereby demonstrating the importance of simple storage capacity; determine whether the illness alters the pattern of correlations across cognitive domains; and evaluate whether between-groups differences in WM capacity could account for the generalized cognitive impairment in PSZ. Method: Ninety-nine PSZ and 77 healthy controls (HCs) completed a visual WM change-localization task, the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), and the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). Results: PSZ performed more poorly than HCs on all cognitive measures. The between-groups effect size for WM capacity was large (d = 1.11). WM robustly correlated with WASI and MCCB performance, with no significant differences in the magnitude or pattern of correlations across groups. When the groups were pooled, WM capacity correlated at r = .68 with MCCB composite score and at r = .56 with WASI estimated Full Scale IQ. WM capacity accounted for approximately 40% of the between-groups variance across the WASI and MCCB. Conclusions: A simple measure of WM storage capacity is robustly associated with the higher order cognitive abilities assessed by the WASI and MCCB in HCs and PSZ. WM capacity reduction may be a critical determinant of the general cognitive impairment in PSZ."
23527501,Emotional intelligence and psychopathy: a comparison of trait and ability measures,Sonja Copestake,"A dysfunction in the processing of emotional material has been suggested to underpin the concept of psychopathy, hence we hypothesized that individuals high in psychopathic traits should have low scores on measure of emotional intelligence (EI). We measured EI by using both an ability-based measure (Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test) and a self-report measure (Trait Meta-Mood Scale) in a sample of offenders. Psychopathy was measured by using both a clinical checklist (Psychopathy Checklist-Revised) and a self-report scale (Psychopathy Personality Inventory-Revised). We also took a measure of intellectual ability (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence) to assess any unique contribution from EI over that of IQ. We found that the concepts of EI (both ability-based and self-report) were related to IQ. We also found that there was a negative relationship between self-report EI and ability EI. In relation to psychopathy, the results did not support the hypotheses of a general deficit in EI. While the results relating different facets of psychopathy to different aspects of EI were complex, there was some evidence that some aspects of psychopathy were positively related to the unique variance related to EI once IQ was partialled out. We suggest that there is not a general deficit in EI in psychopathy, and that future research needs carefully to carefully consider just what aspects of psychopathy and of EI are being measured, and the influence of intellectual ability, before drawing conclusions on this matter."
23525147,"Prospective memory, personality, and individual differences",Bob Uttl,"A number of studies investigating the relationship between personality and prospective memory (ProM) have appeared during the last decade. However, a review of these studies reveals little consistency in their findings and conclusions. To clarify the relationship between ProM and personality, we conducted two studies: a meta-analysis of prior research investigating the relationships between ProM and personality, and a study with 378 participants examining the relationships between ProM, personality, verbal intelligence, and retrospective memory. Our review of prior research revealed great variability in the measures used to assess ProM, and in the methodological quality of prior research; these two factors may partially explain inconsistent findings in the literature. Overall, the meta-analysis revealed very weak correlations (rs ranging from 0.09 to 0.10) between ProM and three of the Big Five factors: Openness, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness. Our experimental study showed that ProM performance was related to individual differences such as verbal intelligence as well as to personality factors and that the relationship between ProM and personality factors depends on the ProM subdomain. In combination, the two studies suggest that ProM performance is relatively weakly related to personality factors and more strongly related to individual differences in cognitive factors."
23524401,Psychiatric Comorbidity in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Comparison with Children with ADHD,Francisca J A van Steensel,"The present study was conducted with the aim to identify comorbid psychiatric disorders in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (n = 40) and to compare those comorbidity rates to those in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (n = 40). Participants were clinically referred children aged 7-18 years. DSM-IV classifications were used for the primary diagnosis (ASD/ADHD), while comorbid psychiatric disorders were assessed using a structured diagnostic interview, the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV, childhood diagnoses (KID-SCID). Twenty-three children with ASD (57.5 %) had at least one comorbid disorder, whereas 16 children with ADHD (40.0 %) were classified as having at least one comorbid disorder. No group differences were found with respect to this comorbidity rate or for the rate of comorbid externalizing disorders (ODD and/or CD). However, children with ASD had more comorbid internalizing disorders compared to children with ADHD. More specifically, children with ASD had higher rates of anxiety disorders, but not mood disorders. No associations between comorbidity and age or between comorbidity and the intelligence quotient was found. It is important for clinicians to always be aware of, and screen for, comorbidity, and to consider treatment for these comorbid disorders. In addition, research should focus on establishing valid and reliable screening tools as well as effective treatment options for these comorbid disorders."
23523976,Emotional intelligence and the relationship to resident performance: a multi-institutional study,Joseph F Talarico,"Study objective: To test the hypothesis that emotional intelligence, as measured by a BarOn Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i), the 125-item version personal inventory (EQ-i:125), correlates with resident performance. Design: Survey (personal inventory) instrument. Setting: Five U.S. academic anesthesiology residency programs. Participants: Postgraduate year (PGY) 2, 3, and 4 residents enrolled in university-based anesthesiology residency programs. Measurements: Residents confidentially completed the BarOn EQ-i:125 personal inventory. The deidentified resident evaluations were sent to the principal investigator of a separate data collection study for data analysis. Data collected from the inventory were correlated with daily evaluations of the residents by residency program faculty. Results of the individual BarOn EQ-i:125 and daily faculty evaluations of the residents were compiled and analyzed. Main results: Univariate correlation analysis and multivariate canonical analysis showed that some aspects of the BarOn EQ-i:125 were significantly correlated with, and likely to be predictors of, resident performance. Conclusions: Emotional intelligence, as measured by the BarOn EQ-i personal inventory, has considerable promise as an independent indicator of performance as an anesthesiology resident."
23523155,Neuropsychological assessment at school-age and prenatal low-level exposure to mercury through fish consumption in an Italian birth cohort living near a contaminated site,L Deroma,"The relative effects of prenatal and postnatal low-level mercury exposure and fish intake on child neurodevelopment are still controversial. Limited evidence is available from Mediterranean populations. In this prospective study, we measured the Verbal and Performance IQ in Italian children at school-age who were resident in an area declared as a National contaminated site because of mercury pollution, taking into account the possible beneficial effect of fish consumption and potential confounders. A mother-child cohort made up of 242 children was established at birth in Northeastern Italy in 2001. Their mothers were interviewed approximately 2 months after delivery to determine type, quantity, and origin of fish consumed during pregnancy and about a number of mother, child and family characteristics. Total mercury (THg) and methyl mercury (MeHg) were assessed in maternal hair and breast milk and in the child's hair. When children reached 7-9 years of age, 154 (63.6%) parents gave consent to participate in a follow-up evaluation. On that occasion, a child's hair sample was collected to determine the current concentration of THg, mothers were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire, and children underwent neuropsychological testing. Verbal IQ, performance IQ and full scale IQ were measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC III) administered by psychologists at school or local health centers. Demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle information, medical information of the child's family and the child's dietary habits were collected using a questionnaire filled in by mothers. Multivariable linear regression models were used to evaluate the association between prenatal THg exposure through fish consumption of mothers in pregnancy and children's IQ after adjustment for possible confounders such as fish consumption of mothers in pregnancy, child's fish consumption at follow-up, child's birthweight, maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy, house size and property place of residence during pregnancy and gender. THg in the child's hair at 7 years of age was fairly correlated with THg in maternal hair at delivery (rs=0.35; p<0.0001) and was strongly correlated with child's seafood consumption (rs=0.50, p<0.0001). No differences in maternal THg levels were found when comparing children with low or extremely low or high or extremely high scores vs others, considering separately full scale, verbal, and performance IQs. Children born from mothers with hair THg levels greater than or equal to 2000ng/g had full scale, verbal and performance IQs which were 4-5 points lower than children born from women with lower THg levels, but these differences were not statistically significant. Fresh fish intake of mothers in pregnancy was slightly positively associated with full scale and performance but not so with verbal IQs. Canned fish showed to be negatively associated with all the outcome variables. Unexpectedly, children born to mothers from one town showed IQ scores significantly lower than the other children; however, none of the many variables considered in these analyses could explain this result. The relatively low Hg levels found in the biological samples did not provide evidence of high and extensive Hg exposure in this population. Although THg levels in maternal and child's biological samples are correlated with fish consumption, the effects of THg and fish on neurological outcomes go in opposite directions. These results do not allow to develop recommendations regarding fish consumption in pregnancy but suggest that keeping THg hair levels<2000ng/g might be desirable."
23520521,Third-party ranks knowledge in wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus),Christèle Borgeaud,"The Machiavellian/Social Intelligence Hypothesis proposes that a complex social environment selected for advanced cognitive abilities in vertebrates. In primates it has been proposed that sophisticated social strategies like obtaining suitable coalition partners are an important component of social intelligence. Knowing the rank relationships between group members is a basic requirement for the efficient use of coalitions and the anticipation of counter-coalitions. Experimental evidence for such knowledge currently exists in only few species. Here, we conducted rank reversal playback experiments on adult females belonging to three different groups of free-ranging vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops pygerythrus) to test their knowledge of the female hierarchy. Playbacks simulating rank reversals (subordinate aggressing a dominant) induced longer looking times than playbacks simulating a dominant aggressing a subordinate. Vervet monkey females therefore seem to compute the rank relationships between other females. Our results suggest that detailed social knowledge about rank relationships may be widespread in primates and potentially also in other species living in stable groups."
23519979,Hippocampal volume predicts fluid intelligence in musically trained people,Mathias S Oechslin,"Recently, age-related hippocampal (HP) volume loss could be associated with a decrease in general fluid intelligence (gF). In the present study we investigated whether and how extensive musical training modulates human HP volume and gF performance. Previously, some studies demonstrated positive effects of musical training on higher cognitive functions such as learning and memory, associated with neural adaptations beyond the auditory domain. In order to detect possible associations between musical training and gF, we bilaterally segmented the HP formation and assessed the individual gF performance of people with different levels of musical expertise. Multiple regression analyses revealed that HP volume predicts gF in musicians but not in nonmusicians; in particular, bilaterally enhanced HP volume is associated with increased gF exclusively in musically trained people (amateurs and experts). This result suggests that musical training facilitates the recruitment of cognitive resources, which are essential for gF and linked to HP functioning. Musical training, even at a moderate level of intensity, can thus be considered as a potential strategy to decelerate age-related effects of cognitive decline."
23518333,Developmental brain dysfunction: revival and expansion of old concepts based on new genetic evidence,Andres Moreno-De-Luca,"Neurodevelopmental disorders can be caused by many different genetic abnormalities that are individually rare but collectively common. Specific genetic causes, including certain copy number variants and single-gene mutations, are shared among disorders that are thought to be clinically distinct. This evidence of variability in the clinical manifestations of individual genetic variants and sharing of genetic causes among clinically distinct brain disorders is consistent with the concept of developmental brain dysfunction, a term we use to describe the abnormal brain function underlying a group of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders and to encompass a subset of various clinical diagnoses. Although many pathogenic genetic variants are currently thought to be variably penetrant, we hypothesise that when disorders encompassed by developmental brain dysfunction are considered as a group, the penetrance will approach 100%. The penetrance is also predicted to approach 100% when the phenotype being considered is a specific trait, such as intelligence or autistic-like social impairment, and the trait could be assessed using a continuous, quantitative measure to compare probands with non-carrier family members rather than a qualitative, dichotomous trait and comparing probands with the healthy population."
23517876,"Possible rheumatoid arthritis subtypes in terms of rheumatoid factor, depression, diagnostic delay and emotional expression: an exploratory case-control study",Taavi Tillmann,"Introduction: Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been implicated in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), particularly as vulnerable personality types are exposed to chronic stress. Emotions are powerful modulators of stress responses. However, little is known about whether patients with RA process emotions differently to matched controls. In this study we: 1) assessed whether the trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) scores of patients with RA differ from healthy controls at the facet level; 2) explored any subgroups in RA, in terms of trait EI and common risk factors. Methods: A total of 637 patients with RA were compared to 496 controls on the trait EI Questionnaire (TEIQue). RA subgroups were explored in terms of trait EI, rheumatoid factor status (RF+/-), depression and time from onset of symptoms until diagnosis (diagnostic delay). Results: The RA group rated themselves lower on Adaptability, Stress-management, Emotion management, Self-esteem, Sociability, Assertiveness, Impulsiveness and Well-being, and higher on Empathy and Relationships than healthy controls. The RF- subtype reported more time with depression (25.2 vs. 11.3 months), a longer diagnostic delay (3.0 vs. 1.7 years), and greater emotional expression (5.15 vs. 4.72), than the RF+ subtype. These differences were significant at the P <0.05 level, but not following strict Bonferroni corrections and should therefore be treated as indicative only. RF- patients with a longer diagnostic delay reported depression lasting three times longer (42.7 months), when compared to three other subtypes (11.0 to 12.7 months). Conclusions: RA patients and controls differ in their emotion-related personality traits, as operationalized by trait EI. These differences may make people with RA more susceptible to chronic stress and HPA-axis dysregulation. RA may be a highly heterogeneous illness where at least two subtypes may be characterized by personality, psychiatric and immunological differences. RF- status, as well as diagnostic delay and emotional expression, may predict future risk of depression. Research on the causes of RA could benefit from a systems science approach."
23517654,Association of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) haploinsufficiency with lower adaptive behaviour and reduced cognitive functioning in WAGR/11p13 deletion syndrome,Joan C Han,"In animal studies, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important regulator of central nervous system development and synaptic plasticity. WAGR (Wilms tumour, Aniridia, Genitourinary anomalies, and mental Retardation) syndrome is caused by 11p13 deletions of variable size near the BDNF locus and can serve as a model for studying human BDNF haploinsufficiency (+/-). We hypothesized that BDNF+/- would be associated with more severe cognitive impairment in subjects with WAGR syndrome. Twenty-eight subjects with WAGR syndrome (6-28 years), 12 subjects with isolated aniridia due to PAX6 mutations/microdeletions (7-54 years), and 20 healthy controls (4-32 years) received neurocognitive assessments. Deletion boundaries for the subjects in the WAGR group were determined by high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization. Within the WAGR group, BDNF+/- subjects (n = 15), compared with BDNF intact (+/+) subjects (n = 13), had lower adaptive behaviour (p = .02), reduced cognitive functioning (p = .04), higher levels of reported historical (p = .02) and current (p = .02) social impairment, and higher percentage meeting cut-off score for autism (p = .047) on Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. These differences remained nominally significant after adjusting for visual acuity. Using diagnostic measures and clinical judgement, 3 subjects (2 BDNF+/- and 1 BDNF+/+) in the WAGR group (10.7%) were classified with autism spectrum disorder. A comparison group of visually impaired subjects with isolated aniridia had cognitive functioning comparable to that of healthy controls. In summary, among subjects with WAGR syndrome, BDNF+/- subjects had a mean Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Compose score that was 14-points lower and a mean intelligence quotient (IQ) that was 20-points lower than BDNF+/+ subjects. Our findings support the hypothesis that BDNF plays an important role in human neurocognitive development."
23516590,Drawing a close to the use of human figure drawings as a projective measure of intelligence,Kana Imuta,"The practice of using children's human figure drawings (HFDs) to assess their intellectual ability is pervasive among psychologists and therapists in many countries. Since the first systematic scoring system for HFDs was published in 1926, their continued popularity has led to the development of several revised versions of the test. Most recently, the Draw-A-Person Intellectual Ability Test for children, adolescents, and adults (DAP:IQ) was published. It is the most up-to-date form of HFD test designed to assess intellectual functioning across a wide age range. In the present study, we assessed the validity of the DAP:IQ as a screening measure of intelligence in both children and adults. In Experiment 1, 100 4- to 5-year-old children completed the DAP:IQ and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-Third Edition. In Experiment 2, 100 adults completed the DAP:IQ and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. In both experiments, we found only weak to modest correlations between scores on the DAP:IQ and the Wechsler tests. Furthermore, when we compared individual's scores on the two tests, the DAP:IQ yielded high false positive and false negative rates when screening for borderline and superior intellectual functioning. Based on these findings, and based on the lack of validity of previous HFD tests, we conclude that practitioners should not rely on HFD tests as a projective measure of intelligence."
23516574,Do dietary trajectories between infancy and toddlerhood influence IQ in childhood and adolescence? Results from a prospective birth cohort study,Lisa G Smithers,"Objective: We examined whether trajectories of dietary patterns from 6 to 24 months of age are associated with intelligence quotient (IQ) in childhood and adolescence. Methods: Participants were children enrolled in a prospective UK birth cohort (n = 7,652) who had IQ measured at age 8 and/or 15 years. Dietary patterns were previously extracted from questionnaires when children were aged 6, 15 and 24 months using principal component analysis. Dietary trajectories were generated by combining scores on similar dietary patterns across each age, using multilevel mixed models. Associations between dietary trajectories and IQ were examined in generalized linear models with adjustment for potential confounders. Results: Four dietary pattern trajectories were constructed from 6 to 24 months of age and were named according to foods that made the strongest contribution to trajectory scores; Healthy (characterised by breastfeeding at 6 months, raw fruit and vegetables, cheese and herbs at 15 and 24 months); Discretionary (biscuits, chocolate, crisps at all ages), Traditional (meat, cooked vegetables and puddings at all ages) and, Ready-to-eat (use of ready-prepared baby foods at 6 and 15 months, biscuits, bread and breakfast cereals at 24 months). In fully-adjusted models, a 1 SD change in the Healthy trajectory was weakly associated with higher IQ at age 8 (1.07 (95%CI 0.17, 1.97)) but not 15 years (0.49 (-0.28, 1.26)). Associations between the Discretionary and Traditional trajectories with IQ at 8 and 15 years were as follows; Discretionary; 8 years -0.35(-1.03, 0.33), 15 years -0.73(-1.33, -0.14) Traditional; 8 years -0.19(-0.71, 0.33)15 years -0.41(-0.77, -0.04)). The Ready-to-eat trajectory had no association with IQ at either age (8 years 0.32(-4.31, 4.95), 15 years 1.11(-3.10, 5.33). Conclusions: The Discretionary and Traditional dietary pattern trajectories from 6 to 24 months of age, over the period when food patterns begin to emerge, are weakly associated with IQ in adolescence."
23513013,Multidimensional analysis of the abnormal neural oscillations associated with lexical processing in schizophrenia,Tingting Xu,"The neural mechanisms of language abnormalities, the core symptoms in schizophrenia, remain unclear. In this study, a new experimental paradigm, combining magnetoencephalography (MEG) techniques and machine intelligence methodologies, was designed to gain knowledge about the frequency, brain location, and time of occurrence of the neural oscillations that are associated with lexical processing in schizophrenia. The 248-channel MEG recordings were obtained from 12 patients with schizophrenia and 10 healthy controls, during a lexical processing task, where the patients discriminated correct from incorrect lexical stimuli that were visually presented. Event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) was computed along the frequency, time, and space dimensions combined, that resulted in a large spectral-spatial-temporal ERD/ERS feature set. Machine intelligence techniques were then applied to select a small subset of oscillation patterns that are abnormal in patients with schizophrenia, according to their discriminating power in patient and control classification. Patients with schizophrenia showed abnormal ERD/ERS patterns during both lexical encoding and post-encoding periods. The top-ranked features were located at the occipital and left frontal-temporal areas, and covered a wide frequency range, including δ (1-4 Hz), α (8-12 Hz), β (12-32 Hz), and γ (32-48 Hz) bands. These top features could discriminate the patient group from the control group with 90.91% high accuracy, which demonstrates significant brain oscillation abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia at the specific frequency, time, and brain location indicated by these top features. As neural oscillation abnormality may be due to the mechanisms of the disease, the spectral, spatial, and temporal content of the discriminating features can offer useful information for helping understand the physiological basis of the language disorder in schizophrenia, as well as the pathology of the disease itself."
23511553,Relationship Between Sleep Problems and Quality of Life in Children With ADHD,Esra Yürümez,"Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess the sleep behaviors, sleep problems and frequency, and relationship with psychiatric comorbidities in ADHD Combined type and to evaluate the effect of sleep problems on quality of life. Method: Forty-six boys, aged 7 to 13 years, with ADHD-combined type and 31 healthy boys were included. ADHD children were never treated for sleep or psychiatric disorders. Intelligence quotient (IQ) test scores were minimum 80, body mass index were normal and did not have medical disorders. Parents completed Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, Conners' Parent Rating Scale and The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and participants were asked about sleep behaviors and were administered PedsQL and Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. Results: The frequency of sleep problems in ADHD is 84.8%, higher than the control group (p = .002). Evaluating PedsQL scores, the quality of life is worse in physical, psychosocial health, and total life quality (p < .05). ADHD group with sleep problems have more night wakings than control group with sleep problems (p = .02). The comorbidity do not increase sleep problems. The frequency of parasomnias is increased in group with learning disorders (p = .05). Conclusion: The results of this study, which controls for a number of possible confounders found in previous examinations of ADHD and sleep, support the results of a number of other studies that have found an increased overall prevalence of parent-reported sleep disturbances in children with ADHD compared with healthy control participants. As the ADHD group have more night wakings than the control group through the night, it is thought that night wakings that cause a partitioned sleep may be important signs seen in ADHD. That could be suggested by two hypotheses. First one is that, daytime sleepiness is more common in ADHD and those children present excessive hyperactivity during the day to stay awake and the second one is the improvement of ADHD signs when the drugs for sleepiness are used. Usage of standardized and valid diagnostic criteria, exclusion of adolescence, gender, socioeconomic level, primary sleep problems, medical disorders and low IQ level, making allowances for effect of comorbidities and having compared with the control group are the important methodological features of this study. The most important limitation of this study is small sample size that makes the findings less generalizable to other groups of children with ADHD, and another one is not having used objective measurements together with subjective measurements. In conclusion, these results underscore the importance of screening all children who have a symptom constellation suggestive of ADHD for sleep problems that may either play a causative role or exacerbate the clinical appearance of ADHD in a given child. Correct evaluation and treatment of sleep problems increase the life quality of family and child and also decrease the severity of ADHD symptoms."
23509927,Clinical implications of daytime sleepiness for the academic performance of middle school-aged adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,Joshua M Langberg,"This study investigated the relative impact of total time slept per night and daytime sleepiness on the academic functioning of 100 middle school-aged youth (mean age = 11.9) with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The primary goal of the study was to determine if total time slept per night and/or daytime sleepiness, as measured by youth self-report on the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS), predicted academic functioning above and beyond symptoms of ADHD and relevant covariates, such as intelligence, achievement scores and parent education level. Self-reported daytime sleepiness but not self-reported total time slept per night was associated significantly with all academic outcomes. When examined in a hierarchical regression model, self-reported daytime sleepiness significantly predicted parent-rated homework problems and academic impairment and teacher-rated academic competence above and beyond symptoms of ADHD and relevant covariates, but did not predict grade point average or teacher-rated academic impairment. The implications of these findings for understanding more clearly the association between ADHD and sleep and the functional implications of this relationship are discussed."
23509018,White matter and visuospatial processing in autism: a constrained spherical deconvolution tractography study,Jane McGrath,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are associated with a marked disturbance of neural functional connectivity, which may arise from disrupted organization of white matter. The aim of this study was to use constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)-based tractography to isolate and characterize major intrahemispheric white matter tracts that are important in visuospatial processing. CSD-based tractography avoids a number of critical confounds that are associated with diffusion tensor tractography, and to our knowledge, this is the first time that this advanced diffusion tractography method has been used in autism research. Twenty-five participants with ASD and aged 25, intelligence quotient-matched controls completed a high angular resolution diffusion imaging scan. The inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) and arcuate fasciculus were isolated using CSD-based tractography. Quantitative diffusion measures of white matter microstructural organization were compared between groups and associated with visuospatial processing performance. Significant alteration of white matter organization was present in the right IFOF in individuals with ASD. In addition, poorer visuospatial processing was associated in individuals with ASD with disrupted white matter in the right IFOF. Using a novel, advanced tractography method to isolate major intrahemispheric white matter tracts in autism, this research has demonstrated that there are significant alterations in the microstructural organization of white matter in the right IFOF in ASD. This alteration was associated with poorer visuospatial processing performance in the ASD group. This study provides an insight into structural brain abnormalities that may influence atypical visuospatial processing in autism."
23506024,Interpreting the g loadings of intelligence test composite scores in light of Spearman's law of diminishing returns,Matthew R Reynolds,"The linear loadings of intelligence test composite scores on a general factor (g) have been investigated recently in factor analytic studies. Spearman's law of diminishing returns (SLODR), however, implies that the g loadings of test scores likely decrease in magnitude as g increases, or they are nonlinear. The purpose of this study was to (a) investigate whether the g loadings of composite scores from the Differential Ability Scales (2nd ed.) (DAS-II, C. D. Elliott, 2007a, Differential Ability Scales (2nd ed.). San Antonio, TX: Pearson) were nonlinear and (b) if they were nonlinear, to compare them with linear g loadings to demonstrate how SLODR alters the interpretation of these loadings. Linear and nonlinear confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models were used to model Nonverbal Reasoning, Verbal Ability, Visual Spatial Ability, Working Memory, and Processing Speed composite scores in four age groups (5-6, 7-8, 9-13, and 14-17) from the DAS-II norming sample. The nonlinear CFA models provided better fit to the data than did the linear models. In support of SLODR, estimates obtained from the nonlinear CFAs indicated that g loadings decreased as g level increased. The nonlinear portion for the nonverbal reasoning loading, however, was not statistically significant across the age groups. Knowledge of general ability level informs composite score interpretation because g is less likely to produce differences, or is measured less, in those scores at higher g levels. One implication is that it may be more important to examine the pattern of specific abilities at higher general ability levels."
23503929,Neurodevelopmental outcomes for children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome at the age of 5 years,Cheryl Brosig,"This study aimed to determine the neurodevelopmental (ND) outcome for children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) at early school age. English-speaking patients who underwent the Norwood procedure between 2000 and 2005 were eligible at 4-6 years of age for ND testing. Of the 72 eligible patients, 44 (61 %) agreed to participate, and 37 completed ND testing before the close of the study. Three subjects were excluded from analyses due to late stroke. The ND testing included intelligence, visual motor integration, memory and motor and language skills. Parents and teachers completed measures of behavior and attention problems. Subjects' scores and parent/teacher ratings were converted to z-scores and compared with test norms. Higher scores on child measures represent better outcomes, whereas higher scores on parent and teacher rating scales indicate more problems. The average ND performance of the tested cohort fell within one standard deviation of the test norms for all measures. However, the subjects performed significantly lower than the test norms on measures of visual-motor integration, fine motor skills, memory, and word structure (z = -0.42 to -0.54; p < 0.005). On the parent and teacher completed measures, the subjects scored higher than the test norms on attention problems (z = 0.40-0.62; p < 0.005). Although the overall ND performance of the cohort was normal, the subjects showed relative weakness in visual motor and attention skills. Ongoing developmental monitoring of these children is recommended to guide interventions that may improve individual outcomes and to assess the impact of changes in clinical management strategies on functional outcomes."
23503813,Neuropsychological Deficits Are Not Predictive of Deficient Emotional Self-Regulation in Adults With ADHD,Craig B H Surman,"Objective: To investigate whether neuropsychological deficits account for the association between deficient emotional self-regulation (DESR) and ADHD. Method: DESR was identified in adults with and without ADHD who reported extreme frequency of items from the Barkley Current Behavior Scale (>95th percentile of control participants). A neuropsychological battery and structured diagnostic interview were administered to 113 adults with ADHD and DESR, 93 adults with ADHD without DESR, and 119 participants without ADHD or DESR. Results: Relative to adults with ADHD without DESR, adults with ADHD and DESR demonstrated lower scores on Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) arithmetic but no other significant differences in neuropsychological performance. Relative to adults without ADHD, both ADHD groups demonstrated lower scores across several measures of executive function. Conclusion: Our findings do not support the hypothesis that neuropsychological deficits are linked to DESR in adults with ADHD. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that DESR could be a manifestation of ADHD, but further study of alternate hypotheses is necessary to support this conclusion."
23503811,Determining the Accuracy of Self-Report Versus Informant-Report Using the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale,Lisa Alexander,"Objective: The present research examined the validity of self-report versus informant-report in relation to a performance-based indicator of adult ADHD. Method: Archival data from 118 participants (52 males, 66 females) were used to compare Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale-Self-Report: Long Format (CAARS-S:L) and Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale-Observer Report: Long Format (CAARS-O:L) with discrepancy scores calculated between the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III) Verbal Comprehension Index - Working Memory Index (VCI - WMI) and Perceptual-Organizational Index - Processing Speed Index (POI - PSI) scaled scores. Results: Neither the self- nor informant-report formats of the CAARS were better predictors of discrepancies between WAIS-III Index scores. Intercorrelations between the CAARS-S:L and CAARS-O:L revealed generally higher correlations between the same scales of different formats and among scales measuring externally visible symptoms. Furthermore, regression analysis indicated that both the CAARS-S:L and CAARS-O:L clinical scales contributed a significant proportion of variance in WAIS-III VCI - WMI discrepancy scores (14.7% and 16.4%, respectively). Conclusion: Results did not establish greater accuracy of self-report versus informant-report of ADHD symptomatology, rather demonstrate the need for multimodal assessment of ADHD in adults."
23502665,Risk factors for scholastic backwardness in children,K Haneesh,"Aim: To identify the risk factors for scholastic backwardness in children. Participants: Children in the 6-12 year age group attending regular schools and referred to the child guidance clinic for scholastic backwardness. Setting: Tertiary care hospital in South India. Methods: Participants were compared with an age-and sex- matched group of children with good academic performance, to ascertain risk factors for scholastic backwardness. Results: There were 75 boys and 35 girls in the study group. Among them 30 (27%) children had mental retardation, 39 (36%) had borderline intelligence and 12 (11%) had microcephaly. Undernutrition was noted in 36 (33%) children and 31 (28%) had stunted growth. 28 (26%) children had a history of chronic medical problems like epilepsy, bronchial asthma and congenital heart diseases. Visual, hearing and speech defects were present in 6 (6%), 5 (5%) and 12 (11%) children, respectively. Statistically significant differences were noted in the educational level and employment status of parents of children with scholastic backwardness and those with good academic performance. Conclusions: Social and family factors have a significant influence on the academic functioning of children."
23502428,"Prevalence, associations, and predictors of apathy in adult survivors of infantile (<5 years of age) posterior fossa brain tumors",Cliodhna Carroll,"Background: Apathy is associated with pervasive and disadvantageous effects on daily functioning. It has been observed transiently in some children after surgery for posterior fossa tumors. In this study, our objective was to examine prevalence, associations, and predictors of apathy in adult survivors of an infantile posterior fossa brain tumor (PFT). Methods: One hundred seventeen adult survivors of a childhood PFT diagnosed before age 5 years and 60 of their siblings were assessed in a cross-sectional study a mean of 32 years (range, 18-53 years) after survivors' initial tumor diagnoses, using the Marin Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for psychiatric disorders. Results: Marin Apathy Evaluation Scale, the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence reached or exceeded a criterion score for clinically significant apathy in 35% of survivors, compared with 18% in a sibling comparison group. In both siblings and survivors, apathy was associated with lower verbal and full-scale IQ and, among survivors, with having undergone partial rather than total tumor resection (independent of irradiation status). Apathy was not related to presence of concurrent International Classification of Diseases, 10(th) Revision, depression. Female sex was associated with late apathy after a PFT, with increased likelihood of women reaching the apathy criterion relative to men if they were survivors. Conclusions: Clinically significant and potentially treatable apathy occurs relatively commonly in adult survivors of an infantile childhood PFT, particularly women. Clinicians, including those managing posterior fossa pathology in very young children, should be aware of this association, and future research should clarify whether specific treatment-related variables are implicated in increasing this risk of apathy."
23497556,Semantic querying of relational data for clinical intelligence: a semantic web services-based approach,Alexandre Riazanov,"Background: Clinical Intelligence, as a research and engineering discipline, is dedicated to the development of tools for data analysis for the purposes of clinical research, surveillance, and effective health care management. Self-service ad hoc querying of clinical data is one desirable type of functionality. Since most of the data are currently stored in relational or similar form, ad hoc querying is problematic as it requires specialised technical skills and the knowledge of particular data schemas. Results: A possible solution is semantic querying where the user formulates queries in terms of domain ontologies that are much easier to navigate and comprehend than data schemas. In this article, we are exploring the possibility of using SADI Semantic Web services for semantic querying of clinical data. We have developed a prototype of a semantic querying infrastructure for the surveillance of, and research on, hospital-acquired infections. Conclusions: Our results suggest that SADI can support ad-hoc, self-service, semantic queries of relational data in a Clinical Intelligence context. The use of SADI compares favourably with approaches based on declarative semantic mappings from data schemas to ontologies, such as query rewriting and RDFizing by materialisation, because it can easily cope with situations when (i) some computation is required to turn relational data into RDF or OWL, e.g., to implement temporal reasoning, or (ii) integration with external data sources is necessary."
23497237,Emotional intelligence assessment in a graduate entry medical school curriculum,Eva M Doherty,"Background: The management of emotions in the workplace is a skill related to the ability to demonstrate empathic behaviour towards patients; to manage emotional reactions in oneself and to lead others as part of a team. This ability has been defined as emotional intelligence (EI) and doctor's EI may be related to communication skills and to patient satisfaction levels. This study reports on the use of two assessments of EI as part of a course on Personal and Professional Development (PPD) in a graduate medical school curriculum. Methods: Fifty one graduate entry medical students completed an eight session course on PPD between December 2005 and January 2006. Students completed two measures of EI: self-report (EQ-i) and ability (MSCEIT V2.0) over a two year study period. The data gathered were used to explore the relationship between self-report and ability EI and between EI and student demographics, academic performance and change over time. Results: Analysis of the EI data demonstrated that self-report EI did not change over time and was not related to ability EI. Females scored higher than males on a number of self-report and ability EI scores. Self-reported self-awareness was found to deteriorate in males and females over time. High self-reported EI was found to be associated with poor performance on clinical competency assessments but with good performance on a number of bio-medical knowledge based assessments. Conclusions: This report concludes that assessments of EI can be incorporated into a medical school curriculum as part of a PPD programme and that the concept of EI may be associated with performance in medical school."
23497145,Incorporating geographical factors with artificial neural networks to predict reference values of erythrocyte sedimentation rate,Qingsheng Yang,"Background: The measurement of the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) value is a standard procedure performed during a typical blood test. In order to formulate a unified standard of establishing reference ESR values, this paper presents a novel prediction model in which local normal ESR values and corresponding geographical factors are used to predict reference ESR values using multi-layer feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANN). Methods and findings: Local normal ESR values were obtained from hospital data, while geographical factors that include altitude, sunshine hours, relative humidity, temperature and precipitation were obtained from the National Geographical Data Information Centre in China.The results show that predicted values are statistically in agreement with measured values. Model results exhibit significant agreement between training data and test data. Consequently, the model is used to predict the unseen local reference ESR values. Conclusions: Reference ESR values can be established with geographical factors by using artificial intelligence techniques. ANN is an effective method for simulating and predicting reference ESR values because of its ability to model nonlinear and complex relationships."
23497090,Plasma cytokine profiling in sibling pairs discordant for autism spectrum disorder,Valerio Napolioni,"Objective: Converging lines of evidence point to the existence of immune dysfunction in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which could directly affect several key neurodevelopmental processes. Previous studies have shown higher cytokine levels in patients with autism compared with matched controls or subjects with other developmental disorders. In the current study, we used plasma-cytokine profiling for 25 discordant sibling pairs to evaluate whether these alterations occur within families with ASD. Methods: Plasma-cytokine profiling was conducted using an array-based multiplex sandwich ELISA for simultaneous quantitative measurement of 40 unique targets. We also analyzed the correlations between cytokine levels and clinically relevant quantitative traits (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale in Autism (VABS) composite score, Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) total T score, head circumference, and full intelligence quotient (IQ)). In addition, because of the high phenotypic heterogeneity of ASD, we defined four subgroups of subjects (those who were non-verbal, those with gastrointestinal issues, those with regressive autism, and those with a history of allergies), which encompass common and/or recurrent endophenotypes in ASD, and tested the cytokine levels in each group. Results: None of the measured parameters showed significant differences between children with ASD and their related typically developing siblings. However, specific target levels did correlate with quantitative clinical traits, and these were significantly different when the ASD subgroups were analyzed. It is notable that these differences seem to be attributable to a predisposing immunogenetic background, as no other significant differences were noticed between discordant sibling pairs. Interleukin-1β appears to be the cytokine most involved in quantitative traits and clinical subgroups of ASD. Conclusions: In the present study, we found a lack of significant differences in plasma-cytokine levels between children with ASD and in their related non-autistic siblings. Thus, our results support the evidence that the immune profiles of children with autism do not differ from their typically developing siblings. However, the significant association of cytokine levels with the quantitative traits and the clinical subgroups analyzed suggests that altered immune responses may affect core feature of ASD."
23496977,Operating room data management: improving efficiency and safety in a surgical block,Vanni Agnoletti,"Background: European Healthcare Systems are facing a difficult period characterized by increasing costs and spending cuts due to economic problems. There is the urgent need for new tools which sustain Hospitals decision makers work. This project aimed to develop a data recording system of the surgical process of every patient within the operating theatre. The primary goal was to create a practical and easy data processing tool to give hospital managers, anesthesiologists and surgeons the information basis to increase operating theaters efficiency and patient safety. Methods: The developed data analysis tool is embedded in an Oracle Business Intelligence Environment, which processes data to simple and understandable performance tachometers and tables. The underlying data analysis is based on scientific literature and the projects teams experience with tracked data. The system login is layered and different users have access to different data outputs depending on their professional needs. The system is divided in the tree profile types Manager, Anesthesiologist and Surgeon. Every profile includes subcategories where operators can access more detailed data analyses. The first data output screen shows general information and guides the user towards more detailed data analysis. The data recording system enabled the registration of 14.675 surgical operations performed from 2009 to 2011. Results: Raw utilization increased from 44% in 2009 to 52% in 2011. The number of high complexity surgical procedures (≥120 minutes) has increased in certain units while decreased in others. The number of unscheduled procedures performed has been reduced (from 25% in 2009 to 14% in 2011) while maintaining the same percentage of surgical procedures. The number of overtime events decreased in 2010 (23%) and in 2011 (21%) compared to 2009 (28%) and the delays expressed in minutes are almost the same (mean 78 min). The direct link found between the complexity of surgical procedures, the number of unscheduled procedures and overtime show a positive impact of the project on OR management. Despite a consistency in the complexity of procedures (19% in 2009 and 21% in 2011), surgical groups have been successful in reducing the number of unscheduled procedures (from 25% in 2009 to 14% in 2011) and overtime (from 28% in 2009 to 21% in 2011). Conclusions: The developed project gives healthcare managers, anesthesiologists and surgeons useful information to increase surgical theaters efficiency and patient safety. In difficult economic times is possible to develop something that is of some value to the patient and healthcare system too."
23496135,The crucial role of the predictability of motor response in visuomotor deficits in very preterm children at school age,Jorrit F De Kieviet,"Aim: We aimed to clarify the underpinnings of widespread visuomotor deficits in very preterm children. Method: Fifty-eight very preterm children (26 males, 32 females; mean [SD] age 7 y 6 mo [5 mo], gestational age 29.2 wks [1.6]; birthweight 1237 g [336]), recruited from a tertiary level neonatal intensive care unit, and 64 age-matched, comparison children born at term (28 males, 36 females; mean age [SD] 7 y 8 mo [7 mo]) participated. IQ was measured using a short form of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (3rd edition). A research diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder (DCD) was defined as a score below the 15th centile on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children. Visuomotor performance was assessed using a computerized task, in which children followed a predictable (structured condition) or an unpredictable (non-structured condition) trail on a touch screen using their index finger. Results: Forty-six per cent of the very preterm children had a research diagnosis of DCD, compared with 16% of children born at term (p<0.001, odds ratio 4.69 [95% CI 2.01-10.99]). No group difference in visuomotor performance was present for the structured condition. In the non-structured condition, children born very preterm with and without a research diagnosis of DCD had poorer visuomotor performance than those born at term. Interpretation: The predictability of the required motor response plays a crucial role in visuomotor deficits in very preterm children, regardless of DCD status."
23495677,"The effect of phosphatidylserine administration on memory and symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial",S Hirayama,"Background: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed behavioural disorder of childhood, affecting 3-5% of school-age children. The present study investigated whether the supplementation of soy-derived phosphatidylserine (PS), a naturally occurring phospholipid, improves ADHD symptoms in children. Methods: Thirty six children, aged 4-14 years, who had not previously received any drug treatment related to ADHD, received placebo (n = 17) or 200 mg day(-1) PS (n = 19) for 2 months in a randomised, double-blind manner. Main outcome measures included: (i) ADHD symptoms based on DSM-IV-TR; (ii) short-term auditory memory and working memory using the Digit Span Test of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children; and (iii) mental performance to visual stimuli (GO/NO GO task). Results: PS supplementation resulted in significant improvements in: (i) ADHD (P < 0.01), AD (P < 0.01) and HD (P < 0.01); (ii) short-term auditory memory (P < 0.05); and (iii) inattention (differentiation and reverse differentiation, P < 0.05) and inattention and impulsivity (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in other measurements and in the placebo group. PS was well-tolerated and showed no adverse effects. Conclusions: PS significantly improved ADHD symptoms and short-term auditory memory in children. PS supplementation might be a safe and natural nutritional strategy for improving mental performance in young children suffering from ADHD."
23492905,IQ of four-year-olds who go on to develop dyslexia,Elsje van Bergen,"Do children who go on to develop dyslexia show normal verbal and nonverbal development before reading onset? According to the aptitude-achievement discrepancy model, dyslexia is defined as a discrepancy between intelligence and reading achievement. One of the underlying assumptions is that the general cognitive development of children who fail to learn to read has been normal. The current study tests this assumption. In addition, we investigated whether possible IQ deficits are uniquely related to later reading or are also related to arithmetic. Four-year-olds (N = 212) with and without familial risk for dyslexia were assessed on 10 IQ subtests. Reading and arithmetic skills were measured 4 years later, at the end of Grade 2. Relative to the controls, the at-risk group without dyslexia had subtle impairments only in the verbal domain, whereas the at-risk group with dyslexia lagged behind across IQ tasks. Nonverbal IQ was associated with both reading and arithmetic, whereas verbal IQ was uniquely related to later reading. The children who went on to develop dyslexia performed relatively poorly in both verbal and nonverbal abilities at age 4, which challenges the discrepancy model. Furthermore, we discuss possible causal and epiphenomenal models explaining the links between early IQ and later reading."
23490758,IQ change over time in schizophrenia and healthy individuals: a meta-analysis,Anna M Hedman,"Background: Cognitive deficits have been recognized as a key feature of schizophrenia, since the first description by Kraepelin. Specifically, lower intelligence is considered a core feature of the disorder and may represent a risk factor for its development. However, whether global intelligence decreases over time in schizophrenia is not known. The aims of this quantitative meta-analysis are to gather, integrate and estimate the overall mean effect size of IQ change over time in schizophrenia as compared to healthy individuals. Methods: A systematic search was conducted to identify relevant studies. Longitudinal studies with at least two intelligence assessments in schizophrenia cohorts were retrieved. Studies had to report sufficient data on IQ-change and include data from healthy comparisons for computation of effect sizes. For each study, the Cohen d was calculated as well as a combined mean effect size. Results: Fourteen studies were identified. Eight studies with a total of 280 patients and 306 healthy controls were suitable to be included. The mean weighted baseline IQ was 97.20 for patients and 109.26 for controls. The mean weighted IQ-change per year was +0.33 for patients and +2.08 for controls. The combined effect size was Cohen's d = -0.48, p = 0.01. Conclusions: A global cognitive deficit is present in patients with schizophrenia expressed as a lower test score increase over repeated testing as compared to healthy subjects possibly due to the lack of practice effects in patients. Thus, schizophrenia is characterized by a relative lack of gain in global cognitive abilities over time."
23489901,Cognitive ability and dental fear and anxiety,My Blomqvist,"Dental fear and anxiety (DFA), as well as dental behavior management problems, are common in children and adolescents. Several psychological factors in the child, and parental DFA, have been studied and found to correlate to the child's DFA. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cognitive ability and DFA in a population-based group of children with identified behavior and learning problems. In conjunction with a dental examination at 11 yr of age, 70 children were assessed with regard to DFA using the Children's Fear Survey Schedule Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS), and their cognitive ability was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. In addition, parental DFA was measured using the Corah Dental Anxiety Scale. The results revealed that DFA was significantly correlated to verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) but not to any other cognitive index. A significant correlation was found between parental DFA and child DFA. The results indicate that the child's verbal capacity may be one factor of importance in explaining dental fear in children."
23489831,Bilateral submandibular duct rerouting: assessment of results on drooling in cerebral palsy cases,Ehsan Khadivi,"Objectives: Drooling is a physiological phenomenon in infants which becomes unusual and even pathologic after 18 months of age. Cerebral palsy (CP), the most common etiology for physical disability, mostly occurs in cases of normal-intelligence kids who are socially active and therefore their disorders require special attention. One of the major problems kids with CP face is excessive drooling and several therapeutic methods have been suggested to treat this problem. In this study described herein, bilateral submandibular duct rerouting (BSMDR) surgery was performed to investigate its effect on drooling in children with CP. Methods: From March 2007 to April 2011, 16 children aged 6-16 years old with cerebral palsy who suffered from excessive drooling were recruited. A thorough physical examination was performed and a questionnaire was completed for each case. Those who met the inclusion criteria and provided an informed consent were selected for BSMDR surgery. They were followed-up twice, 10 days and 6 months after the operation to evaluate the degree of drooling or other possible side effects of the surgery. Results: Sixteen patients entered the study and underwent surgery. On the first follow-up visit 87.50% presented overall improvement, of which 56.25% showed good to excellent improvement in contrast to 31.25% who exhibited fair improvement. On the second follow-up an overall improvement was observed in 81.25%, of which 43.75% showed good to excellent improvement compared to 37.50% with fair improvement. Conclusion: Considering that during both the first and second follow-up visit only two cases (12.5%) did not respond to treatment, it could be concluded that BSMDR surgery is an effective treatment for reducing drooling in CP children."
23489595,Is insight in schizophrenia multidimensional? Internal structure and associations of the Greek version of the Schedule for the Assessment of Insight-Expanded,George Konstantakopoulos,"Despite the general agreement that insight is a multidimensional phenomenon, the studies on the factorial structure of the scales for its assessment have yielded rather inconsistent results. The present study aimed to assess the internal structure of the Schedule for the Assessment of Insight (SAI-E). Seventy-two chronic patients with schizophrenia were assessed with SAI-E. Hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling (MDS) were used to identify insight components and assess their inter-relationships. The associations of the extracted components with demographic, clinical and cognitive characteristics were also examined. The SAI-E demonstrated good psychometric properties. Three subscales of SAI-E were identified measuring awareness of illness, relabeling of symptoms, and treatment compliance. Moreover, the MDS disclosed two underlying dimensions--degree of 'specificity' and 'spontaneity'--within the insight construct. Treatment compliance was more strongly correlated with symptom relabeling than illness awareness. Excitement symptoms, global functioning and general intelligence were correlated with all the components of insight. Depressive symptoms were more strongly correlated with illness awareness. Impaired relabeling ability was linked to cognitive rigidity and greater severity of disorganization and positive symptoms. Education and severity of negative symptoms specifically affect treatment compliance. Our results support the hypothesis that insight is a multidimensional construct."
23488941,"Recent trends in the incidence, geographical distribution, and survival from thyroid cancer in Wales, 1985-2010",Bethan Amphlett,"Background: Previous studies of thyroid cancer incidence in Wales have given varying results with suggestions of an excess of cases in geographic areas that were previously exposed to the radioactive fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear reactor incident. Our objective in this study was to provide an up-to-date comprehensive analysis of time trends in the incidence, geographical distribution, and survival from thyroid cancer in Wales. Methods: We identified thyroid cancer cases, registered from 1985 through 2010 in the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit (WCISU). Age standardized rates were determined from the European standard population. A Poisson regression model was fitted to assess temporal trends and rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were determined and compared across consecutive time periods: 1985-1997 and 1998-2010. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for each of the 22 local authority areas. Relative survival and Kaplan-Meier curves were computed to analyze all cause and thyroid cancer-specific survival. Results: A total of 1747 thyroid cancer cases were registered from 1985 to 2010. Age standardized incidence rates were 2.8 and 1.2 per 100,000 population per year for females and males respectively. Incidence rates increased with time (RR 1.3 [CI 1.2-1.5], p < 0.001; 1998-2010 vs. 1985-1997). The incidence of papillary cancer increased progressively over the study period (RR 2.22 [CI 1.91-2.57], p < 0.001; 1998-2010 vs. 1985-1997), while rates for other (nonpapillary) histological subtypes remained static (RR 0.95 [CI 0.84-1.08], p = 0.45; 1998-2010 vs. 1985-1997). We identified two geographical areas of increased incidence, but the spatial distribution of cases was inconsistent with exposure to radioactive fallout. Five-year relative survival from all-cause mortality improved from 74.2 [CI 66.8-80.1] in 1985-1989 to 82.6 [CI 77.1-86.9] in 2000-2004, but remained poor for patients over the age of 65 years (p < 0.001, > 65 years vs. 15-64 years) and patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (p < 0.001; anaplastic vs. other histological varieties). Conclusions: The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased in Wales, predominantly due to an increase in papillary cancers. The current geographical distribution of cases does not support a radiation effect in the region. Survival has remained poor for patients over the age of 65 years and those with anaplastic carcinoma."
23488588,Empathic responsiveness in amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex in youths with psychopathic traits,Abigail A Marsh,"Background: Psychopathic traits are associated with increases in antisocial behaviors such as aggression and are characterized by reduced empathy for others' distress. This suggests that psychopathic traits may also impair empathic pain sensitivity. However, whether psychopathic traits affect responses to the pain of others versus the self has not been previously assessed. Method: We used whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural activation in 14 adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder and psychopathic traits, as well as 21 healthy controls matched on age, gender, and intelligence. Activation in structures associated with empathic pain perception was assessed as adolescents viewed photographs of pain-inducing injuries. Adolescents imagined either that the body in each photograph was their own or that it belonged to another person. Behavioral and neuroimaging data were analyzed using random-effects analysis of variance. Results: Youths with psychopathic traits showed reduced activity within regions associated with empathic pain as the depicted pain increased. These regions included rostral anterior cingulate cortex, ventral striatum (putamen), and amygdala. Reductions in amygdala activity particularly occurred when the injury was perceived as occurring to another. Empathic pain responses within both amygdala and rostral anterior cingulate cortex were negatively correlated with the severity of psychopathic traits as indexed by PCL:YV scores. Conclusions: Youths with psychopathic traits show less responsiveness in regions implicated in the affective response to another's pain as the perceived intensity of this pain increases. Moreover, this reduced responsiveness appears to predict symptom severity."
23488480,"Forensic paleontology: a tool for ""intelligence"" and investigation",Eva Sacchi,"Paleontology and facies analysis proved to be useful tools in activities of intelligence and investigation on some criminal cases, as well as in in-court activities, thus defining the ""forensic paleontology"" area of study. The definition was given by analyzing its possible specific applications and excluding some marginal activities. The reliability of forensic paleontology was then assessed in light of the results achieved in some actual cases and in an ad hoc simulation. The investigated cases concerned intelligence and ordinary law enforcement activities. Special attention was paid to crimes against the cultural heritage. Ex post re-examination of the cases substantiated the value of this scientific branch in investigations, while stressing the possible difficulties in explaining its results to lay persons. Therefore, careful preparation of technical and linguistic preliminary notes for judges, prosecutors, and lawyers as well as a special training for consultants are recommended before presenting results as exhibits in in-court cross-examinations."
23486747,Spectroscopic imaging based approach for condom identification in condom contaminated fingermarks,Robert Bradshaw,"Sexual offenders are increasingly reported to use condoms while committing the crime, mainly to prevent the transfer of DNA evidence. Although condoms are often removed from the crime scene, vaginal swabs can be taken from the victim to prove the presence of condom lubricants and therefore evidence of corpus delicti. However, late reporting to the police and the tendency of the victim to wash immediately after the crime, may compromise the detection of condom lubricants. Recently we showed that Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation MS Imaging (MALDI MSI) of condom contaminated fingermarks enables images of the fingermark ridge pattern to be obtained simultaneously with the detection of the condom lubricant for two condom brands, thus becoming a potential alternative way to link the assailant to the crime. Building on the value of this information, it would be advantageous to identify the condom brand used during the sexual assault. Here we show the development of a multidisciplinary spectroscopic approach, including MALDI MSI, MS/MS, Raman microscopy and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, applied to a range of condom brands/types. The techniques have complementary features and provide complementary information to retrieve a ""condom brand spectroscopic fingerprint"". Unique spectroscopic profiles would greatly aid in the screening and identification of the condom, thus adding intelligence to the case under investigation."
23486486,Perspective-Taking Ability in Bilingual Children: Extending Advantages in Executive Control to Spatial Reasoning,Anastasia Greenberg,"Monolingual and bilingual 8-year-olds performed a computerized spatial perspective-taking task. Children were asked to decide how an observer saw a four-block array from one of three different positions (90°, 180°, and 270° counter-clockwise from the child's position) by selecting one of four responses -- the correct response, the egocentric error, an incorrect choice in which the array was correct but in the wrong orientation for the viewer, and an incorrect choice in which the array included an internal spatial error. All children performed similarly on background measures, including fluid intelligence, but bilingual children were more accurate than monolingual children in calculating the observer's view across all three positions, with no differences in the pattern of errors committed by the two language groups. The results are discussed in terms of the effect of bilingualism on modifying performance in a complex spatial task that has implications for academic achievement."
23486422,"Manganese exposure: cognitive, motor and behavioral effects on children: a review of recent findings",Silvia Zoni,"Purpose of review: Manganese (Mn) is an essential element, but can be neurotoxic when exceeding the homeostatic range. We reviewed the most recent human studies (from January 2011 to July 2012) regarding the association between Mn exposure and cognitive, motor and behavioral effects on children. Recent findings: A total of 10 articles were located; data were collected from five different countries. Six studies showed adverse effect of Mn on cognitive function. The most adopted cognitive test was the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) or some subtests from it and results suggest an inverse association of higher Mn exposure with lower intellligence quotient. Three studies focused on motor effects of Mn; two of them found a direct association of higher Mn exposure with increased motor impairment. Two studies assessed Mn impact on behavior; one of them showed a correlation between higher Mn in water and both internalizing and externalizing behavioral scores. Potential limitations of these studies included the lack of validated biomarkers and the lack of consideration of mixed co-exposure with other neurotoxic agents. Summary: Despite some potential limitations of the reviewed studies, the adverse effects of manganese exposure on the developing brain is well demonstrated and preventive strategies should be promoted."
23485033,Cognitive outcome in adolescents and young adults after repeat courses of antenatal corticosteroids,Johanna Stålnacke,"Objective: To investigate whether repeat courses of antenatal corticosteroids have long-term effects on cognitive and psychological functioning. Study design: In a prospective cohort study, 58 adolescents and young adults (36 males) who had been exposed to 2-9 weekly courses of betamethasone in utero were assessed with neuropsychological tests and behavior self-reports. Unexposed subjects (n = 44, 25 males) matched for age, sex, and gestational age at birth served as a comparison group. In addition, individuals exposed in utero to a single course (n = 25, 14 males) were included for dose-response analysis. Group differences were investigated using multilevel linear modeling. Results: Mean scores obtained in 2 measures of attention and speed were significantly lower in subjects exposed to 2 or more antenatal corticosteroids courses (Symbol Search, P = .009; Digit Span Forward, P = .02), but these were not dose-dependent. Exposure to repeat courses of antenatal corticosteroids was not associated with general deficits in higher cognitive functions, self-reported attention, adaptability, or overall psychological function. Conclusions: Although this study indicates that repeat exposure to antenatal corticosteroids may have an impact on aspects of executive functioning, it does not provide support for the prevailing concern that such fetal exposure will have a major adverse impact on cognitive functions and psychological health later in life."
23481123,Does lifetime exposure to hormones predict pretreatment cognitive function in women before adjuvant therapy for breast cancer?,Catherine M Bender,"Objective: Women with breast cancer have been found to have poorer cognitive function before the initiation of systemic adjuvant therapy than their age- and education-matched counterparts. The basis for this may partly include hormone exposure during the course of a woman's life. Methods: We compared cognitive function between postmenopausal women with breast cancer before the initiation of systemic adjuvant therapy and healthy age- and education-matched postmenopausal women and examined whether factors related to lifetime exposure to hormones predicted cognitive function before therapy. Results: We found that, compared with healthy women, women with breast cancer had poorer memory (P = 0.05) and attention (P = 0.006). Controlling for the covariates age and estimated verbal intelligence, we found that factors related to greater lifetime hormone exposure (oral contraceptive use, greater years since menopause, and longer duration of hormone therapy) predicted cognitive function (executive function, verbal learning and memory, attention, psychomotor efficiency, and visual sustained attention) in women with and without breast cancer but did not explain the differences in cognitive function observed at pretreatment in women with breast cancer. Conclusions: Other factors may explain the poorer pretreatment cognitive function in women with breast cancer, including persistent effects of surgical operation and anesthesia, sleep problems, and tumor-related factors. Additional studies are needed to explicate the basis of poorer pretherapy cognitive function in this population."
23480642,The analysis of challenging relations: influences on interactive behaviour of staff towards clients with intellectual disabilities,A P A M Willems,"Background: Relationships between support staff and clients with intellectual disability (ID) are important for quality of care, especially when dealing with challenging behaviour. Building upon an interpersonal model, this study investigates the influence of client challenging behaviour, staff attitude and staff emotional intelligence on interactive behaviour of one of these relationship partners, being support staff. Method: A total of 158 support staff members completed a questionnaire on staff interactive behaviour for 158 clients with ID and challenging behaviour, as well as two questionnaires on staff interpersonal attitude and emotional intelligence. Results: Confronted with challenging behaviour as opposed to no challenging behaviour, staff reported less friendly, more assertive control and less support-seeking interpersonal behaviour. Also, staff used more proactive thinking and more self-reflection in dealing with challenging behaviour. Staff interpersonal attitude in general, mainly a harsh-dominant-resentful attitude, had a significant influence on most staff interactive behaviours towards an individual client with challenging behaviour. The influence of staff emotional intelligence, specifically intrapersonal abilities, on staff interactive behaviour towards an individual client with challenging behaviour was somewhat limited. Conclusions: This research supports the necessity for training staff in general interpersonal attitudes towards clients as well as training in intrapersonal emotional intelligence, when confronted with challenging behaviour. Future research should focus more on the bidirectional dynamics of staff and client interactions."
23480321,Long-term administration of intranasal oxytocin is a safe and promising therapy for early adolescent boys with autism spectrum disorders,Masaya Tachibana,"Objective: Oxytocin (OT) has been a candidate for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and the impact of intranasally delivered OT on ASD has been investigated. However, most previous studies were conducted by single-dose administration to adults; and, therefore, the long-term effect of nasal OT on ASD patients and its effect on children remain to be clarified. Methods: We conducted a singled-armed, open-label study in which OT was administered intranasally over the long term to eight male youth with ASD (10-14 years of age; intelligence quotient [IQ] 20-101). The OT administration was performed in a stepwise increased dosage manner every 2 months (8, 16, 24 IU/dose). A placebo period (1-2 weeks) was inserted before each step. The outcome measures were autism diagnostic observation schedule--generic (ADOS-G), child behavior checklist (CBCL), and the aberrant behavior checklist (ABC). In addition, side effects were monitored by measuring blood pressure and examining urine and blood samples. Results: Six of the eight participants showed improved scores on the communication and social interaction domains of the ADOS-G. However, regarding the T-scores of the CBCL and the scores of the ABC, we could not find any statistically significant improvement, although several subcategories showed a mild tendency for improvement. Caregivers of five of the eight participants reported certain positive effects of the OT therapy, especially on the quality of reciprocal communication. All participants showed excellent compliance and no side effects. Conclusions: Although our results on the efficacy of long-term nasal OT therapy still remain controversial, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report documenting the safety of long-term nasal OT therapy for children with ASD. Even though our data are too preliminary to draw any definite conclusions about efficacy, they do suggest this therapy to be safe, promising, and worthy of a large-scale, double-blind placebo-controlled study."
23479631,Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of human behavior,Michal Kosinski,"We show that easily accessible digital records of behavior, Facebook Likes, can be used to automatically and accurately predict a range of highly sensitive personal attributes including: sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender. The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88% of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95% of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85% of cases. For the personality trait ""Openness,"" prediction accuracy is close to the test-retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy."
25076821,A Fully Actuated Robotic Assistant for MRI-Guided Prostate Biopsy and Brachytherapy,Gang Li,"Intra-operative medical imaging enables incorporation of human experience and intelligence in a controlled, closed-loop fashion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an ideal modality for surgical guidance of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, with its ability to perform high resolution, real-time, high soft tissue contrast imaging without ionizing radiation. However, for most current image-guided approaches only static pre-operative images are accessible for guidance, which are unable to provide updated information during a surgical procedure. The high magnetic field, electrical interference, and limited access of closed-bore MRI render great challenges to developing robotic systems that can perform inside a diagnostic high-field MRI while obtaining interactively updated MR images. To overcome these limitations, we are developing a piezoelectrically actuated robotic assistant for actuated percutaneous prostate interventions under real-time MRI guidance. Utilizing a modular design, the system enables coherent and straight forward workflow for various percutaneous interventions, including prostate biopsy sampling and brachytherapy seed placement, using various needle driver configurations. The unified workflow compromises: 1) system hardware and software initialization, 2) fiducial frame registration, 3) target selection and motion planning, 4) moving to the target and performing the intervention (e.g. taking a biopsy sample) under live imaging, and 5) visualization and verification. Phantom experiments of prostate biopsy and brachytherapy were executed under MRI-guidance to evaluate the feasibility of the workflow. The robot successfully performed fully actuated biopsy sampling and delivery of simulated brachytherapy seeds under live MR imaging, as well as precise delivery of a prostate brachytherapy seed distribution with an RMS accuracy of 0.98mm."
23475826,"Working memory screening, school context, and socioeconomic status: an analysis of the effectiveness of the working memory rating scale in Brazil",Pascale M J Engel de Abreu,"Objective: The study explores the psychometric properties of the Brazilian-Portuguese version of the Working Memory Rating Scale (WMRS-Br) in a population of 355 young children from diverse socioeconomic status and schooling backgrounds. Method: Public and private school teachers completed the WMRS-Br and children were assessed on a range of objective cognitive measures of fluid intelligence, working memory, and attention. Results: Reliability and validity of the WMRS-Br were excellent across the public and private school sample. The WMRS-Br manifested substantial links with objective measures of working memory and medium links with selective attention, switching, and interference suppression. Confirmatory factor analyses suggest that a shorter version of the scale provides an adequate fit to the data. Conclusion: The WMRS-Br represents a valid screening tool in a Latin American context that has the potential to improve the early detection of working memory deficits in children growing up in poverty."
23475778,The assessment of cognitive abilities in psychiatric patients: are widely used psychological tests still up-to-date?],Elfi Antretter,"Objective: Evaluation of widely used tests for the assessment of cognitive abilities of adult psychiatric patients in German speaking countries by current psychometric standards. Methods: The German Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales (HAWIE, HAWIE-R, WIE), the Multiple Choice Vocabulary Test (MWT-B), the German adaption and revision of the Benton Visual Retention Test (BT; 10-Item version, 20-Item version), and the d2 Test of attention (Test d2, d2-C, d2-R) were evaluated. A systematic search for relevant psychometric test publications in German language journals and textbooks was carried out. Three evaluation criteri a were considered: 1) theoretical foundation, 2) availability of actual test norms, 3) usual psychometric test validity and reliability criteria. Results: The theoretical foundation of all of the psychological tests under review was found to be very weak. The norm values of some of the tests are outdated. Most of the psychological tests do not fulfill high quality standards of psychometric testing. Conclusions: The examined psychological tests for the assessment of cognitive abilities of psychiatric patients only partly conform to current standards of psychological testing. It is likely that the test results are of limited value. Misleading or even incorrect clinical evaluations might be a frequent outcome."
23474990,Is it normal to be a principal mindreader? Revising theories of social cognition on the basis of schizophrenia and high functioning autism-spectrum disorders,Tom Froese,"Schizophrenia and high functioning autism-spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions that mainly impair social competence, while general intelligence (IQ) is spared. Both disorders have a strong ancillary role in theoretical research on social cognition. Recently the debate has started to be inflected by embodied and phenomenological approaches, which claim that the standard portrayal of all social understanding as so-called 'mindreading', i.e. the attribution of mental states to others in the service of explaining and predicting their behavior, is misguided. Instead it is emphasized that we normally perceive others directly as conscious and goal-directed persons, without requiring any theorizing and/or simulation. This paper evaluates some of the implications of abnormal experiences reported by people with schizophrenia and ASD for the current debate in cognitive science. For these people the practice of explicit mindreading seems to be a compensatory strategy that ultimately fails to compensate for - and may even exacerbate - their impairment of intuitive and interactive social understanding. Phenomenological psychopathology thereby supports the emerging view that 'mindreading' is not the principal form of normal social understanding."
23473622,Recognition memory and the medial temporal lobe: from monkey research to human pathology,M Meunier,"This review provides a historical overview of decades of research on recognition memory, the process that allows both humans and animals to tell familiar from novel items. The emphasis is put on how monkey research improved our understanding of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) role and how tasks designed for monkeys influenced research in humans. The story starts in the early 1950s. Back then, memory was not a fashionable scientific topic. It was viewed as a function of the whole brain and not of specialized brain areas. All that changed in 1957-1958 when Brenda Milner, a neuropsychologist from Montreal, described patient H.M. He forgot all events as he lived them despite a fully preserved intelligence. He had received a MTL resection to relieve epilepsy. H.M. (1926-2008) would become the most influential patient in brain science. Which structures among those included in H.M.'s large lesion were important for recognition memory could not be evaluated in humans. It was gradually understood only after the successful development of a monkey model of human amnesia by Mishkin in 1978. Selective lesions and two behavioral tasks, delayed nonmatching-to-sample and visual paired comparison, were used to distinguish the contribution of the hippocampus from that of adjacent cortical areas. Driven by findings in non-human primates, human research on recognition memory is now trying to solve the question of whether the different structures composing MTL contributes to familiarity and recollection, the two possible forms taken by recognition. We described in particular two French patients, FRG and JMG, whose deficits support the currently dominant model attributing to the perirhinal cortex a critical role in recognition memory. Research on recognition memory has implications for the clinician as it may help understanding the cognitive deficits observed in different diseases. An illustration of such approach, linking basic and applied research, is provided for Alzheimer's disease."
23472441,The nature of well-being: the roles of hedonic and eudaimonic processes and trait emotional intelligence,Navjot Bhullar,"The present study reconceptualized the role of hedonic (pleasure) and eudaimonic (engagement) functions as well-being processes and distinguished them from well-being outcomes. Well-being outcomes encompass life satisfaction, positive affect, psychological well-being, social well-being, subjective physical health, and absence of depression, anxiety, and stress. It was hypothesized that trait emotional intelligence (EI) would mediate the relationship between well-being processes and well-being outcomes. Participants (N = 370, mean age = 27.35 years, SD = 10.01) completed measures of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being processes, trait EI, and well-being outcome indices. Path analysis using structural equation modeling showed that trait EI fully mediated the relationship between hedonic and eudaimonic processes and well-being outcomes. Results demonstrated that engagement in meaningful activities as captured by hedonic and eudaimonic well-being processes may promote well-being outcomes."
23472304,Development of hybrid genetic-algorithm-based neural networks using regression trees for modeling air quality inside a public transportation bus,Akhil Kadiyala,"The present study developed a novel approach to modeling indoor air quality (IAQ) of a public transportation bus by the development of hybrid genetic-algorithm-based neural networks (also known as evolutionary neural networks) with input variables optimized from using the regression trees, referred as the GART approach. This study validated the applicability of the GART modeling approach in solving complex nonlinear systems by accurately predicting the monitored contaminants of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), 0.3-0.4 microm sized particle numbers, 0.4-0.5 microm sized particle numbers, particulate matter (PM) concentrations less than 1.0 microm (PM10), and PM concentrations less than 2.5 microm (PM2.5) inside a public transportation bus operating on 20% grade biodiesel in Toledo, OH. First, the important variables affecting each monitored in-bus contaminant were determined using regression trees. Second, the analysis of variance was used as a complimentary sensitivity analysis to the regression tree results to determine a subset of statistically significant variables affecting each monitored in-bus contaminant. Finally, the identified subsets of statistically significant variables were used as inputs to develop three artificial neural network (ANN) models. The models developed were regression tree-based back-propagation network (BPN-RT), regression tree-based radial basis function network (RBFN-RT), and GART models. Performance measures were used to validate the predictive capacity of the developed IAQ models. The results from this approach were compared with the results obtained from using a theoretical approach and a generalized practicable approach to modeling IAQ that included the consideration of additional independent variables when developing the aforementioned ANN models. The hybrid GART models were able to capture majority of the variance in the monitored in-bus contaminants. The genetic-algorithm-based neural network IAQ models outperformed the traditional ANN methods of the back-propagation and the radial basis function networks. Implications: The novelty of this research is the development of a novel approach to modeling vehicular indoor air quality by integration of the advanced methods of genetic algorithms, regression trees, and the analysis of variance for the monitored in-vehicle gaseous and particulate matter contaminants, and comparing the results obtained from using the developed approach with conventional artificial intelligence techniques of back propagation networks and radial basis function networks. This study validated the newly developed approach using holdout and threefold cross-validation methods. These results are of great interest to scientists, researchers, and the public in understanding the various aspects of modeling an indoor microenvironment. This methodology can easily be extended to other fields of study also."
23472077,Evaluation of epidemic intelligence systems integrated in the early alerting and reporting project for the detection of A/H5N1 influenza events,Philippe Barboza,"The objective of Web-based expert epidemic intelligence systems is to detect health threats. The Global Health Security Initiative (GHSI) Early Alerting and Reporting (EAR) project was launched to assess the feasibility and opportunity for pooling epidemic intelligence data from seven expert systems. EAR participants completed a qualitative survey to document epidemic intelligence strategies and to assess perceptions regarding the systems performance. Timeliness and sensitivity were rated highly illustrating the value of the systems for epidemic intelligence. Weaknesses identified included representativeness, completeness and flexibility. These findings were corroborated by the quantitative analysis performed on signals potentially related to influenza A/H5N1 events occurring in March 2010. For the six systems for which this information was available, the detection rate ranged from 31% to 38%, and increased to 72% when considering the virtual combined system. The effective positive predictive values ranged from 3% to 24% and F1-scores ranged from 6% to 27%. System sensitivity ranged from 38% to 72%. An average difference of 23% was observed between the sensitivities calculated for human cases and epizootics, underlining the difficulties in developing an efficient algorithm for a single pathology. However, the sensitivity increased to 93% when the virtual combined system was considered, clearly illustrating complementarities between individual systems. The average delay between the detection of A/H5N1 events by the systems and their official reporting by WHO or OIE was 10.2 days (95% CI: 6.7-13.8). This work illustrates the diversity in implemented epidemic intelligence activities, differences in system's designs, and the potential added values and opportunities for synergy between systems, between users and between systems and users."
23471309,"Global consensus theorem and self-organized criticality: unifying principles for understanding self-organization, swarm intelligence and mechanisms of carcinogenesis",Simon Rosenfeld,"Complex biological systems manifest a large variety of emergent phenomena among which prominent roles belong to self-organization and swarm intelligence. Generally, each level in a biological hierarchy possesses its own systemic properties and requires its own way of observation, conceptualization, and modeling. In this work, an attempt is made to outline general guiding principles in exploration of a wide range of seemingly dissimilar phenomena observed in large communities of individuals devoid of any personal intelligence and interacting with each other through simple stimulus-response rules. Mathematically, these guiding principles are well captured by the Global Consensus Theorem (GCT) equally applicable to neural networks and to Lotka-Volterra population dynamics. Universality of the mechanistic principles outlined by GCT allows for a unified approach to such diverse systems as biological networks, communities of social insects, robotic communities, microbial communities, communities of somatic cells, social networks and many other systems. Another cluster of universal laws governing the self-organization in large communities of locally interacting individuals is built around the principle of self-organized criticality (SOC). The GCT and SOC, separately or in combination, provide a conceptual basis for understanding the phenomena of self-organization occurring in large communities without involvement of a supervisory authority, without system-wide informational infrastructure, and without mapping of general plan of action onto cognitive/behavioral faculties of its individual members. Cancer onset and proliferation serves as an important example of application of these conceptual approaches. In this paper, the point of view is put forward that apparently irreconcilable contradictions between two opposing theories of carcinogenesis, that is, the Somatic Mutation Theory and the Tissue Organization Field Theory, may be resolved using the systemic approaches provided by GST and SOC."
23470840,Cognitive characteristics of PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes,Robyn M Busch,"Purpose: We sought to characterize cognition in individuals with germline PTEN mutations (n = 23) as well as in PTEN mutation-negative individuals with classic Cowden syndrome or Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (n = 2). Methods: Twenty-five individuals completed a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. One sample t-tests and effect sizes were used to examine differences in participant test scores compared with normal controls. Composite scores were created for each patient within each of the cognitive domains assessed and classified as above average, average, or below average according to normative standards. χ(2) analyses compared these classifications to expected proportions in normal control samples. Results: The mean intelligence quotient was in the average range, and the range of intellectual functioning was very wide (from extremely low to very superior). However, in a large subset of patients, scores were lower than expected on measures of motor functioning, executive functioning, and memory recall, suggesting disruption of frontal circuits in these participants. Conclusion: This is the first study to characterize cognition in individuals with PTEN mutations and associated syndromes using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Contrary to previous reports suggesting an association with intellectual disability, the mean intelligence quotient was average, and there was a broad range of intellectual abilities. Specific evidence of disruption of frontal circuits may have implications for treatment compliance and cancer surveillance, and further investigation is warranted."
23467498,Is later better or worse? Association of advanced parental age with offspring cognitive ability among half a million young Swedish men,Mikko Myrskylä,"Parental ages are increasing in the developed world, and postponed parenthood may have a negative association with the cognitive ability of offspring. There is, however, inconclusive evidence regarding the impact of both maternal and paternal ages. We have been able to reduce or eliminate unobserved confounding by using methods that account for fixed parental characteristics shared by brothers. Associations between parental age and intelligence quotient (IQ) among 565,433 Swedish males (birth cohorts 1951 to 1976) were analyzed, with IQ measured at conscription examinations (given between ages 17 and 20 years). When we accounted for the IQ time trend by adjusting for birth year, advanced paternal age showed no association with offspring IQ; however, maternal ages above 30 years were inversely associated with offspring IQ. For example, maternal ages 40-44 years were associated with an offspring IQ that was 0.07 standard deviations lower than that for maternal ages 25-29 years (P < 0.001). However, the IQ trend more than offset the impact of age, as without birth year adjustment, advanced maternal age was positively associated with IQ. Although the results confirmed that maternal age was negatively associated with offspring IQ, the association was small enough that delaying parenthood resulted in higher offspring IQ scores because of the positive IQ test score trend."
23466253,Questionnaire-based assessment of behavioral problems in Japanese children with epilepsy,Katsuhiro Kobayashi,"Behavioral problems in Japanese children with epilepsy were investigated by means of a questionnaire for parents consisting of three checklists: the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)/4-18 Japanese Edition, the High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), and the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS) for parents. The participants were the parents of 108 children aged 6-18 years with apparently normal intelligence. The CBCL indicated abnormal behavior in 10.5 to 35.6% of the children, and T scores on both the internalizing and externalizing scales had a significant positive relation with scores on the ASSQ and ADHD-RS. It was revealed through multivariate logistic regression analysis that the persistence of seizures was significantly related with abnormality on the externalizing scale of the CBCL (p=0.010, odds ratio: 3.48, 95% confidence interval: 1.34-9.02). Future studies are needed to determine whether seizure freedom improves behavior in children with epilepsy."
23462307,Effect of age at treatment on cognitive performance in patients with cystinosis,Lisa Viltz,"Objective: To determine whether early treatment with cysteamine affects cognitive functioning in patients with nephropathic cystinosis. Study design: Forty-six subjects aged 3-18 years with cystinosis underwent cognitive testing to determine intelligence, visual-spatial abilities, and visual-motor skills. An age-matched control group (n = 85; age 2-22 years) underwent the same tests. Age at diagnosis and age at initiation of treatment with cysteamine were recorded at the time of testing. Results: Patients with cystinosis treated at or after age 2 years (late-treatment group) scored significantly lower on verbal, performance, and full-scale IQ measures, as well as on a test of visual-spatial skills, compared with patients treated before age 2 years (early-treatment group) and controls. Both groups of subjects with cystinosis demonstrated impaired visual-motor skills compared with controls, with no difference between the early-treatment and late-treatment groups. Conclusion: Early treatment with cysteamine appears to improve intellectual function in patients with nephropathic cystinosis. However, the lack of improvement in visual-motor function with early cysteamine treatment suggests possibly different mechanisms underlying visual-motor performance compared with other areas of cognition in this disorder."
23462266,A neural computational model for animal's time-to-collision estimation,Ling Wang,"The time-to-collision (TTC) is the time elapsed before a looming object hits the subject. An accurate estimation of TTC plays a critical role in the survival of animals in nature and acts as an important factor in artificial intelligence systems that depend on judging and avoiding potential dangers. The theoretic formula for TTC is 1/τ≈θ'/sin θ, where θ and θ' are the visual angle and its variation, respectively, and the widely used approximation computational model is θ'/θ. However, both of these measures are too complex to be implemented by a biological neuronal model. We propose a new simple computational model: 1/τ≈Mθ-P/(θ+Q)+N, where M, P, Q, and N are constants that depend on a predefined visual angle. This model, weighted summation of visual angle model (WSVAM), can achieve perfect implementation through a widely accepted biological neuronal model. WSVAM has additional merits, including a natural minimum consumption and simplicity. Thus, it yields a precise and neuronal-implemented estimation for TTC, which provides a simple and convenient implementation for artificial vision, and represents a potential visual brain mechanism."
23460831,A diagnostic model incorporating P50 sensory gating and neuropsychological tests for schizophrenia,Jia-Chi Shan,"Objectives: Endophenotypes in schizophrenia research is a contemporary approach to studying this heterogeneous mental illness, and several candidate neurophysiological markers (e.g. P50 sensory gating) and neuropsychological tests (e.g. Continuous Performance Test (CPT) and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)) have been proposed. However, the clinical utility of a single marker appears to be limited. In the present study, we aimed to construct a diagnostic model incorporating P50 sensory gating with other neuropsychological tests in order to improve the clinical utility. Methods: We recruited clinically stable outpatients meeting DSM-IV criteria of schizophrenia and age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Participants underwent P50 sensory gating experimental sessions and batteries of neuropsychological tests, including CPT, WCST and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Third Edition (WAIS-III). Results: A total of 106 schizophrenia patients and 74 healthy controls were enrolled. Compared with healthy controls, the patient group had significantly a larger S2 amplitude, and thus poorer P50 gating ratio (gating ratio = S2/S1). In addition, schizophrenia patients had a poorer performance on neuropsychological tests. We then developed a diagnostic model by using multivariable logistic regression analysis to differentiate patients from healthy controls. The final model included the following covariates: abnormal P50 gating (defined as P50 gating ratio >0.4), three subscales derived from the WAIS-III (Arithmetic, Block Design, and Performance IQ), sensitivity index from CPT and smoking status. This model had an adequate accuracy (concordant percentage = 90.4%; c-statistic = 0.904; Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit Test, p = 0.64>0.05). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study to date using P50 sensory gating in subjects of Chinese ethnicity and the first to use P50 sensory gating along with other neuropsychological tests to develop a diagnostic model for schizophrenia. Further research to validate the predictive accuracy of this model by applying it on other samples is warranted."
23460690,Predictors of phrase and fluent speech in children with autism and severe language delay,Ericka L Wodka,"Objective: To examine the prevalence and predictors of language attainment in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and severe language delay. We hypothesized greater autism symptomatology and lower intelligence among children who do not attain phrase/fluent speech, with nonverbal intelligence and social engagement emerging as the strongest predictors of outcome. Methods: Data used for the current study were from 535 children with ASD who were at least 8 years of age (mean = 11.6 years, SD = 2.73 years) and who did not acquire phrase speech before age 4. Logistic and Cox proportionate hazards regression analyses examined predictors of phrase and fluent speech attainment and age at acquisition, respectively. Results: A total of 372 children (70%) attained phrase speech and 253 children (47%) attained fluent speech at or after age 4. No demographic or child psychiatric characteristics were associated with phrase speech attainment after age 4, whereas slightly older age and increased internalizing symptoms were associated with fluent speech. In the multivariate analyses, higher nonverbal IQ and less social impairment were both independently associated with the acquisition of phrase and fluent speech, as well as earlier age at acquisition. Stereotyped behavior/repetitive interests and sensory interests were not associated with delayed speech acquisition. Conclusions: This study highlights that many severely language-delayed children in the present sample attained phrase or fluent speech at or after age 4 years. These data also implicate the importance of evaluating and considering nonverbal skills, both cognitive and social, when developing interventions and setting goals for language development."
23459197,FITNESS BENEFITS OF COALITIONARY AGGRESSION IN MALE CHIMPANZEES,Ian C Gilby,"Coalitionary aggression occurs when at least two individuals jointly direct aggression at one or more conspecific targets. Scientists have long argued that this common form of cooperation has positive fitness consequences. Nevertheless, despite evidence that social bond strength (which is thought to promote coalition formation) is correlated with fitness in primates, cetaceans, and ungulates, few studies have directly examined whether coalitionary aggression improves reproductive success. We tested the hypothesis that among free-ranging chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii), participation in coalitionary aggression increases reproductive output. Using 14 years of genetic and behavioral data from Gombe National Park, Tanzania, we found that coalitionary aggression increased a male's chances of A) siring offspring, compared to other males of similar dominance rank, and B) ascending in rank, a correlate of future reproductive output. Because male chimpanzees form coalitions with many others within a complex network, we used social network analysis to identify the types of connections correlated with these fitness benefits. The beneficiaries of coalitionary aggression were males with the highest 'betweenness' - that is, those who tended to have coalition partners who themselves did not form coalitions with each other. This suggests that beyond simply recognizing third-party relationships, chimpanzees may use this knowledge to choose coalition partners. If so, this is a significant step forward in our knowledge of the adaptive value of social intelligence. Regardless of mechanism, however, this is the first evidence of genetic benefits of coalitionary aggression in this species, and therefore has important implications for understanding the evolution of cooperation."
23458547,The costs and benefits of mind-wandering: a review,Benjamin W Mooneyham,"Substantial evidence suggests that mind-wandering typically occurs at a significant cost to performance. Mind-wandering-related deficits in performance have been observed in many contexts, most notably reading, tests of sustained attention, and tests of aptitude. Mind-wandering has been shown to negatively impact reading comprehension and model building, impair the ability to withhold automatized responses, and disrupt performance on tests of working memory and intelligence. These empirically identified costs of mind-wandering have led to the suggestion that mind-wandering may represent a pure failure of cognitive control and thus pose little benefit. However, emerging evidence suggests that the role of mind-wandering is not entirely pernicious. Recent studies have shown that mind-wandering may play a crucial role in both autobiographical planning and creative problem solving, thus providing at least two possible adaptive functions of the phenomenon. This article reviews these observed costs and possible functions of mind-wandering and identifies important avenues of future inquiry."
23457906,Neurobehavioural functioning in school-aged children with a corrected septal heart defect,Iemke Sarrechia,"Objective: This cross-sectional study assesses neurobehavioural consequences after surgical treatment for acyanotic congenital heart defect at the age of 5 to 12 years. Methods and results: Fifteen school-aged children who underwent surgical intervention for a septal heart defect were examined with the short form Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-third Edition, Dutch Version (WISC-III-NL), and a neuropsychological assessment with the Nepsy. Performances were compared to a matched healthy control group. Parents completed the Child Behaviour Checklist and were interviewed to rate the child's cognitive and emotional functioning. Children older than eight years filled out a self-perception questionnaire. Analyses revealed significant differences between the study groups on several cognitive and behavioural domains. Estimated intelligence scores were in the average range. Domains of attention and fine motor skills, and the subtest level of language abilities, elicited significant group differences, with less favourable outcomes for the patient group. Parents of patients reported more withdrawn behaviour, social difficulties, thought problems, attentional shortcomings and lower competence for activities. These parents also indicated poor problem solving skills in everyday activities. Conclusions: Surgical patients displayed subtle neuropsychological difficulties concerning language and fine motor skills. Behavioural difficulties were common. Future research should address risk factors for adverse neurobehavioural manifestations in this patient group."
23454994,Building emotional intelligence: a strategy for emerging nurse leaders to reduce workplace bullying,Karen Bennett,"Bullying is one of the most concerning forms of aggression in health care organizations. Conceptualized as an emotion-based response, bullying is often triggered by today's workplace challenges. Unfortunately, workplace bullying is an escalating problem in nursing. Bullying contributes to unhealthy and toxic environments, which in turn contribute to ineffective patient care, increased stress, and decreased job satisfaction among health care providers. These equate to a poor workforce environment, which in turn increases hospital costs when nurses choose to leave. Nurse managers are in positions of power to recognize and address negative workplace behaviors, such as bullying. However, emerging leaders in particular may not be equipped with the tools to deal with bullying and consequently may choose to overlook it. Substantive evidence from other disciplines supports the contention that individuals with greater emotional intelligence are better equipped to recognize early signs of negative behavior, such as bullying. Therefore, fostering emotional intelligence in emerging nurse leaders may lead to less bullying and more positive workplace environments for nurses in the future."
23454987,Value-based resource management: a model for best value nursing care,Barbara A Caspers,"With the health care environment shifting to a value-based payment system, Catholic Health Initiatives nursing leadership spearheaded an initiative with 14 hospitals to establish best nursing care at a lower cost. The implementation of technology-enabled business processes at point of care led to a new model for best value nursing care: Value-Based Resource Management. The new model integrates clinical patient data from the electronic medical record and embeds the new information in care team workflows for actionable real-time decision support and predictive forecasting. The participating hospitals reported increased patient satisfaction and cost savings in the reduction of overtime and improvement in length of stay management. New data generated by the initiative on nursing hours and cost by patient and by population (Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups), and patient health status outcomes across the acute care continuum expanded business intelligence for a value-based population health system."
23454920,Intelligence and embodiment: a statistical mechanics approach,Alejandro Chinea,"Evolutionary neuroscience has been mainly dominated by the principle of phylogenetic conservation, specifically, by the search for similarities in brain organization. This principle states that closely related species tend to be similar because they have a common ancestor. However, explaining, for instance, behavioral differences between humans and chimpanzees, has been revealed to be notoriously difficult. In this paper, the hypothesis of a common information-processing principle exploited by the brains evolved through natural evolution is explored. A model combining recent advances in cognitive psychology and evolutionary neuroscience is presented. The macroscopic effects associated with the intelligence-like structures postulated by the model are analyzed from a statistical mechanics point of view. As a result of this analysis, some plausible explanations are put forward concerning the disparities and similarities in cognitive capacities which are observed in nature across species. Furthermore, an interpretation on the efficiency of brain's computations is also provided. These theoretical results and their implications against modern theories of intelligence are shown to be consistent with the formulated hypothesis."
23453550,Small for gestational age and intrauterine growth restriction decreases cognitive function in young adults,Gro C C Løhaugen,"Objective: To examine the effect on adult cognitive function of being born small for gestational age (SGA), and to evaluate whether cognitive function is related to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Study design: Fifty-nine SGA subjects (birth weight <10th percentile) and 81 controls (birth weight ≥10th percentile) born at term underwent cognitive assessment with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition at age 19-20 years. Repeated ultrasound measures of fetal growth were available for weeks 25, 33, and 37 in a subgroup of 29 SGA subjects and 75 control subjects, and these were data used to dichotomize the 29 SGA subjects into those with IUGR and those without IUGR. IUGR was defined as growth deviating more than -2 SD from the mean value of the control group. The effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy was considered as well. Group differences were analyzed using a general linear model, controlling for sex and socioeconomic status. Results: The SGA group had lower full IQ scores than the control group (mean difference, -6.3; 95% CI, -2.8 to -9.7; P = .001), including lower scores on 6 of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition subtests. In the SGA subgroup with repeated ultrasound measures, 6 of 29 subjects (21%) had IUGR, and these subjects also had a lower IQ compared with controls (mean difference, -14.0; 95% CI: -4.8 to -23.3; P = .003). Maternal smoking during pregnancy was related to lower IQ in the control group but not in the SGA group, independent of IUGR or non-IUGR status. Conclusion: IQ scores were lower in young adults born SGA compared with controls. Our analysis suggest that this outcome is related to IUGR."
23453546,The Global School Adaptation score: a new neurodevelopmental assessment tool for very preterm children at five years of age,Gérald Boussicault,"Objective: To determine the usefulness of a neurodevelopmental assessment tool consisting of a questionnaire administered to teachers to measure the Global School Adaptation (GSA) scores of very preterm children at the age of 5 years. Study design: A sample of 445 very preterm children (<35 weeks of gestation) was assessed at 5 years of age using GSA and IQ scores. According to the consistency between the scores, children were determined to be well classified, intermediately classified, or misclassified. The differences between groups were assessed through univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: The GSA score was highly or intermediately consistent with the IQ score for 89.2% of the children, and 10.8% were considered misclassified. Children with a higher GSA than IQ score had more autonomy and self-confidence (P < .01), and those with a lower GSA than IQ score had more behavioral problems (P < .01). Analysis by logistic regression showed that sex and gestational age significantly affected the consistency between the 2 scores. Thus, girls were less likely to have a lower GSA than IQ score (aOR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24-0.84; P = .01), and a lower gestational age significantly increased the likelihood of having a higher GSA than IQ score (for children born between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation: aOR = 2.70; 95% CI: 1.23-5.92; P = .01). Conclusions: The GSA score is a simple, inexpensive, and reliable screening tool for assessing neurodevelopment in very preterm children at 5 years of age."
23452685,Intrinsic functional connectivity of amygdala-based networks in adolescent generalized anxiety disorder,Amy K Roy,"Objective: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) typically begins during adolescence and can persist into adulthood. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this disorder remain unclear. Recent evidence from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) studies in adults suggests disruptions in amygdala-based circuitry; the present study examines this issue in adolescents with GAD. Method: Resting state fMRI scans were obtained from 15 adolescents with GAD and 20 adolescents without anxiety who were group matched on age, sex, scanner, and intelligence. Functional connectivity of the centromedial, basolateral, and superficial amygdala subdivisions was compared between groups. We also assessed the relationship between amygdala network dysfunction and anxiety severity. Results: Adolescents with GAD exhibited disruptions in amygdala-based intrinsic functional connectivity networks that included regions in medial prefrontal cortex, insula, and cerebellum. Positive correlations between anxiety severity scores and amygdala functional connectivity with insula and superior temporal gyrus were also observed within the GAD group. There was some evidence of greater overlap (less differentiation of connectivity patterns) of the right basolateral and centromedial amygdala networks in the adolescents with, relative to those without, GAD. Conclusions: These findings suggest that adolescents with GAD manifest alterations in amygdala circuits involved in emotion processing, similar to findings in adults. In addition, disruptions were observed in amygdala-based networks involved in fear processing and the coding of interoceptive states."
23452585,Tick-borne encephalitis carries a high risk of incomplete recovery in children,Åsa Fowler,"Objective: To examine long-term outcome after tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in children. Study design: In this population-based cohort, 55 children with TBE with central nervous system involvement infected during 2004-2008 were evaluated 2-7 years later using the Rivermead post-concussion symptoms questionnaire (n = 42) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning for parents and teachers (n = 32, n = 22, respectively). General cognitive ability was investigated in a subgroup (n = 20) using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition. Results: At long-term follow-up, two-thirds of the children experienced residual problems, the main complaints being cognitive problems, headache, fatigue, and irritability. More than one-third of the children were reported by parents or teachers to have problems with executive functioning on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning, mainly in areas involving initiating and organizing activities and working memory. Children who underwent Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition testing had a significantly lower working memory index compared with reference norms. Conclusion: A large proportion of children experience an incomplete recovery after TBE with central nervous system involvement. Cognitive problems in areas of executive function and working memory are the most prevalent. Even if mortality and severe sequelae are low in children after TBE, all children should be followed after TBE to detect cognitive deficits."
23451902,Subclinical ischemia verified by somatosensory evoked potential amplitude reduction during carotid endarterectomy: negative effects on cognitive performance,Tomohiro Inoue,"Object: Although the mechanisms underlying neurocognitive changes after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) are poorly understood, intraoperative ischemia and postoperative hemodynamic changes may play a role. Methods: Data from 81 patients who underwent unilateral CEA with routine shunt use for carotid artery stenosis were retrospectively evaluated. These patients underwent neuropsychological examinations (NPEs), including assessment by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised before and 6 months after CEA. results of NPEs were converted into z scores, from which pre- and postoperative cognitive composite scores (CSpre and CSpost) were obtained. The association between the change of CS between pre- and postoperative NPEs (that is, CSpost - CSpre [CSpost - pre]) and various variables was assessed. These latter variables included ischemic or hemodynamic parameters such as 1) intraoperative hypoperfusion detected by somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) change-that is, an SSEP amplitude reduction more than 50% and longer than 5 minutes (SSEP< 50%, > 5 min); 2) new lesions on postoperative diffusion-weighted imaging studies; and 3) preexisting hemodynamic impairment. Paired t-tests of the NPE scores were performed to determine the net effect of these factors on neurocognitive function at 6 months. Results: A significant CSpost - pre decrease was observed in patients with SSEP< 50%, > 5 min when compared with those without SSEP< 50%, > 5 min (-0.225 vs 0.018; p = 0.012). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that SSEP< 50%, > 5 min independently and negatively correlated with CSpost - pre (p = 0.0020). In the group-rate analysis, postoperative NPE scores were significantly improved relative to preoperative scores. Conclusions: Hypoperfusion during cross-clamping, as verified by SSEP amplitude reduction, plays a significant role in the subtle decline in cognition following CEA. However, this detrimental effect was small, and various confounding factors were present. Based on these observations and the group-rate analysis, the authors conclude that successful unilateral CEA with routine shunt use does not adversely affect postoperative cognitive function."
23451725,Higher order language competence and adolescent mental health,Nancy J Cohen,"Background: Clinic and community-based epidemiological studies have shown an association between child psychopathology and language impairment. The demands on language for social and academic adjustment shift dramatically during adolescence and the ability to understand the nonliteral meaning in language represented by higher order language becomes essential. Objectives: : This article reports on the association between difficulties in higher order language skills, reading, cognition, and social-emotional adjustment in adolescents. Method: : 144 clinic-referred and 186 comparison youth aged 12-18 years were administered a battery of standardized tests of intelligence, working memory, structural and higher order language, and reading achievement. Parent ratings on the Child Behavior Checklist were used as a measure of severity of social-emotional problems. Results: : Clinic-referred youth scored significantly lower than comparison youth on measures of structural and higher order language, working memory, and reading. Of the clinic-referred youth, 45% had some type of higher order language impairment, whereas this was the case for 15% of youth in the comparison group. Lower levels of nonverbal ability and working memory as well as lower level of mothers' education were associated with greater risk of having higher order language impairment. Conclusions: : Findings have implications for practitioners' seeking to understand and treat adolescents since therapeutic techniques rely on skills where higher order language is at play including the ability to discuss opinions flexibly and to weigh interpretations. Therapists must be aware that there are areas that have potential for miscommunication with some adolescents and where inaccurate inferences may be made about their behavior. Furthermore, educators must consider resources for youth who may increasingly struggle in high school because of such difficulties."
23451119,Community intelligence in knowledge curation: an application to managing scientific nomenclature,Lin Dai,"Harnessing community intelligence in knowledge curation bears significant promise in dealing with communication and education in the flood of scientific knowledge. As knowledge is accumulated at ever-faster rates, scientific nomenclature, a particular kind of knowledge, is concurrently generated in all kinds of fields. Since nomenclature is a system of terms used to name things in a particular discipline, accurate translation of scientific nomenclature in different languages is of critical importance, not only for communications and collaborations with English-speaking people, but also for knowledge dissemination among people in the non-English-speaking world, particularly young students and researchers. However, it lacks of accuracy and standardization when translating scientific nomenclature from English to other languages, especially for those languages that do not belong to the same language family as English. To address this issue, here we propose for the first time the application of community intelligence in scientific nomenclature management, namely, harnessing collective intelligence for translation of scientific nomenclature from English to other languages. As community intelligence applied to knowledge curation is primarily aided by wiki and Chinese is the native language for about one-fifth of the world's population, we put the proposed application into practice, by developing a wiki-based English-to-Chinese Scientific Nomenclature Dictionary (ESND; http://esnd.big.ac.cn). ESND is a wiki-based, publicly editable and open-content platform, exploiting the whole power of the scientific community in collectively and collaboratively managing scientific nomenclature. Based on community curation, ESND is capable of achieving accurate, standard, and comprehensive scientific nomenclature, demonstrating a valuable application of community intelligence in knowledge curation."
23449117,An automatic weighting system for wild animals based in an artificial neural network: how to weigh wild animals without causing stress,Diego Francisco Larios,"This paper proposes a novel and autonomous weighing system for wild animals. It allows evaluating changes in the body weight of animals in their natural environment without causing stress. The proposed system comprises a smart scale designed to estimate individual body weights and their temporal evolution in a bird colony. The system is based on computational intelligence, and offers valuable large amount of data to evaluate the relationship between long-term changes in the behavior of individuals and global change. The real deployment of this system has been for monitoring a breeding colony of lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni) in southern Spain. The results show that it is possible to monitor individual weight changes during the breeding season and to compare the weight evolution in males and females."
27757147,Maternal Body Mass Index during Pregnancy and Offspring Neurocognitive Development,Wendy Y Craig,"Background: This hypothesis generating study explores second trimester maternal body mass index (BMI) during pregnancy and offspring neurocognitive development. Methods: Mothers and offspring served as controls in two earlier studies: 101 children at age two years and 118 children at age eight years. Results: Frequency of maternal BMI ≥30 kg/m2 increased from 10% in 1987-1990 to 30% in 2004-2006 (P < 0.001); the socioeconomic gradient became more pronounced. At age two, one or more BSID-III (Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 3rd Edition) scores <85 were more frequent with higher maternal BMI (P = 0.029); regression analysis suggested an inverse relationship between language scores and BMI (P = 0.054). Among eight-year-olds, one or more WISC-III (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 3rd edition) scores <85 increased with maternal BMI (P = 0.017); regression analysis showed an inverse relationship between performance subscale IQ score and BMI (P = 0.023). Conclusion: Second trimester maternal obesity may be an independent risk factor for some aspects of children's neurocognitive development. Further study is indicated."

I suggest that a better approach might be to compare nations as well for their creativity and wisdom."
25632167,Hippocampal structure and human cognition: key role of spatial processing and evidence supporting the efficiency hypothesis in females,Roberto Colom,"Here we apply a method for automated segmentation of the hippocampus in 3D high-resolution structural brain MRI scans. One hundred and four healthy young adults completed twenty one tasks measuring abstract, verbal, and spatial intelligence, along with working memory, executive control, attention, and processing speed. After permutation tests corrected for multiple comparisons across vertices (p < .05) significant relationships were found for spatial intelligence, spatial working memory, and spatial executive control. Interactions with sex revealed significant relationships with the general factor of intelligence (g), along with abstract and spatial intelligence. These correlations were mainly positive for males but negative for females, which might support the efficiency hypothesis in women. Verbal intelligence, attention, and processing speed were not related to hippocampal structural differences."
23447455,"Six months of dance intervention enhances postural, sensorimotor, and cognitive performance in elderly without affecting cardio-respiratory functions",Jan-Christoph Kattenstroth,"During aging, sensorimotor, cognitive and physical performance decline, but can improve by training and exercise indicating that age-related changes are treatable. Dancing is increasingly used as an intervention because it combines many diverse features making it a promising neuroplasticity-inducing tool. We here investigated the effects of a 6-month dance class (1 h/week) on a group of healthy elderly individuals compared to a matched control group (CG). We performed a broad assessment covering cognition, intelligence, attention, reaction time, motor, tactile, and postural performance, as well as subjective well-being and cardio-respiratory performance. After 6 months, in the CG no changes, or further degradation of performance was found. In the dance group, beneficial effects were found for dance-related parameters such as posture and reaction times, but also for cognitive, tactile, motor performance, and subjective well-being. These effects developed without alterations in the cardio-respiratory performance. Correlation of baseline performance with the improvement following intervention revealed that those individuals, who benefitted most from the intervention, were those who showed the lowest performance prior to the intervention. Our findings corroborate previous observations that dancing evokes widespread positive effects. The pre-post design used in the present study implies that the efficacy of dance is most likely not based on a selection bias of particularly gifted individuals. The lack of changes of cardio-respiratory fitness indicates that even moderate levels of physical activity can in combination with rich sensorimotor, cognitive, social, and emotional challenges act to ameliorate a wide spectrum of age-related decline."
23447439,Slower processing speed after treatment for pediatric brain tumor and acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Lisa S Kahalley,"Background: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and brain tumor (BT) survivors are at risk for post-treatment IQ declines. The extent to which lower scores represent global cognitive decline versus domain-specific impairment remains unclear. This study examined discrepancies between processing speed and estimated IQ (EIQ) scores and identified clinical characteristics associated with score discrepancies in a sample of pediatric cancer survivors. Procedure: Survivors (50 ALL, 50 BT) ages 12-17 years completed cognitive testing. The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence provided an untimed measure of general reasoning ability (EIQ). The age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence Scale provided a Processing Speed Index (PSI) score. Scores were examined and compared. Results: Survivors' PSI scores were lower than their EIQ scores (BT t(45) =6.3, p<0.001; ALL t(49) =6.9, p<0.001). For BT survivors, lower PSI scores were associated with history of craniospinal irradiation, t(44) =3.3, p<0.01. For ALL survivors, lower PSI scores were associated with male gender, grade retention, and time since diagnosis, F(3, 46) =10.1, p<0.001. Clinically significant EIQ-PSI score discrepancies were identified in 41.3% of BT and 14.0% of ALL survivors. Conclusions: Many pediatric BT and ALL survivors exhibit slower processing speed than expected for age, whereas general reasoning ability remains largely intact. Risk factors associated with larger EIQ-PSI discrepancies include the following: BT diagnosis, craniospinal irradiation (BT only), male gender, and younger age at diagnosis (ALL only). Grade retention was frequent and associated with lower EIQ scores (both groups) and PSI scores (ALL only). Describing post-treatment cognitive declines using global measures of intellectual ability may underestimate dysfunction or fail to isolate specific underlying deficits contributing to impairment."
23446726,"High intellectual capacity, problem-solving and creativity]",Sylvia Sastre-Riba,"The aim of the study is focused on the characteristics and components of creativity as a multidimensional construct in the context of intelligence, divergent thinking and problem solving, and their incorporation into the definition and explanation of intellectual functioning of giftedness and talent. It shows the progress of the investigation from the initial postulates of Guilford about the nature and cognitive processes involved in the creative act, its features and components, development and differential expression in the high intellectual ability, and the neurological correlates neuropsychological research is beginning to show. We present the results obtained with 41 participants with high intellectual capacity profiles of giftedness or talent of 6 to 14 years. We measure their cognitive skills through BADyG or DAT tests, and creative skills by the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT), in two measuring points. Analyses show comparatively among high ability profiles: 1) the creative measurement stability between the two time points, 2) statistically significant differences between the creative components of fluency, flexibility and originality, related to the profiles of giftedness or talent (convergent or divergent), 3) the statistically significant changes among the scores of the creative components, at all ages studied."
23446456,Semen parameters can be predicted from environmental factors and lifestyle using artificial intelligence methods,Jose L Girela,"Fertility rates have dramatically decreased in the last two decades, especially in men. It has been described that environmental factors as well as life habits may affect semen quality. In this paper we use artificial intelligence techniques in order to predict semen characteristics resulting from environmental factors, life habits, and health status, with these techniques constituting a possible decision support system that can help in the study of male fertility potential. A total of 123 young, healthy volunteers provided a semen sample that was analyzed according to the World Health Organization 2010 criteria. They also were asked to complete a validated questionnaire about life habits and health status. Sperm concentration and percentage of motile sperm were related to sociodemographic data, environmental factors, health status, and life habits in order to determine the predictive accuracy of a multilayer perceptron network, a type of artificial neural network. In conclusion, we have developed an artificial neural network that can predict the results of the semen analysis based on the data collected by the questionnaire. The semen parameter that is best predicted using this methodology is the sperm concentration. Although the accuracy for motility is slightly lower than that for concentration, it is possible to predict it with a significant degree of accuracy. This methodology can be a useful tool in early diagnosis of patients with seminal disorders or in the selection of candidates to become semen donors."
23445719,The neuroanatomy of herophilus,J M S Pearce,"Herophilus (ca. 330 to ca. 260 BC) was one of Hellenistic -Alexandria's renowned scholars, a leading physician, often named the 'Father of Anatomy'. From cadaveric dissections and possibly vivisection Herophilus considered the ventricles to be the seat of the soul, intelligence and mental functions. Herophilus introduced the term rete mirabile found in ungulates but not in man, as opposed to Galen, who erroneously believed it a vital human network. A founder of the principles of observations in science, and an exponent of measurements in medicine, his accurate dissections resulted in original anatomical discoveries. He distinguished nerves that produce voluntary motion from blood vessels, and motor from sensory nerves; the nerves of the spinal cord were directly linked to the brain. He identified at least seven pairs of cranial nerves. Herophilus demonstrated the meninges, and ventricles, regarding the fourth as most important. His name is perpetuated by his accounts of the calamus scriptorius and the confluence of venous sinuses the torcular Herophili."
23444947,"A comparison of the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB) with ""traditional"" neuropsychological testing instruments",Patrick J Smith,"The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) is frequently used in research protocols and increasingly in clinical practice. Despite the frequency of its use, important aspects of its measurement validity have yet to be established in healthy adults. Two hundred and fifty-five individuals completed the CANTAB and traditional neuropsychological tests commonly used in clinical practice, including selected subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Animal Naming, Trail Making Tests A and B, the Stroop test, and the Green Story Recall test. Results showed that CANTAB subtests were modestly correlated with traditional subtests. Correlations between CANTAB subtests and traditional subtests were less consistent when age and education were controlled for. In conclusion, the CANTAB shows modest associations with traditional neuropsychological test measures."
23444345,Intellectual and academic outcome following two chemotherapy regimens and radiotherapy for average-risk medulloblastoma: COG A9961,M Douglas Ris,"Purpose: Assess the intellectual and academic outcomes as well as risk factors associated with treatment for average-risk medulloblastoma in childhood using 23.4 Gy of craniospinal radiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: From an overall sample of 379 enrolled in the parent study (COG A9961), 110 patients received a total of 192 assessments over more than 5 years with standardized IQ and academic achievement tests. Random coefficient models of the various outcomes were developed that incorporated covariates including chemotherapy regimen, age at diagnosis, sex, initial Full Scale IQ, and mutism. Results: Participants in this study were found to be comparable to the overall sample in all demographic, disease, and treatment factors, except there were more gross total resections in the subsample undergoing intellectual and academic assessment. Major findings include significant decline in both intellectual and academic domains over time that were greater in children who were younger at diagnosis and had higher initial intelligence test scores. Children with mutism were at higher risk for initial effects on intelligence. No effects of sex were found. Conclusion: These results show progressive decline over several years post-treatment in standardized intellectual and academic scores. Despite recent improvements in therapies for these children, most notably a decrease dose of craniospinal radiation, they remain at risk. The pursuit of less toxic treatments, particularly for younger children, should continue. Neuropsychological surveillance should be routine at centers treating children with brain tumors."
23444103,Pretibial linear vertical creases or indentations (shin dimples) associated with arthrogryposis,Judith G Hall,"Among 2,500 cases of arthrogryposis, 14 families and 17 individuals were identified that had a linear vertical crease (indentation/dimple) along the anterior tibia, usually bilaterally. Approximately half had developmental delay/intellectual disability and the others had normal intellectual development. There are generalized flexion contractures with the legs more severely affected than the arms. The ankles are flexed at birth suggesting a relationship of contraction of the anterior tibial compartment to the in utero development of the anterior tibial crease. Dislocated hips are seen in 60%. Hands open with physical therapy and become quite functional. Those with normal intelligence are ambulatory, often with a crouching stance. Three families had recurrence suggesting a recessive pattern of inheritance. All parents were normal. No affected individuals have had offspring. Several have had CGH arrays, which were normal. The presence of this crease in cases of arthrogryposis appears to be a helpful clinical observation and may even be pathognomonic."
23443820,WAIS-IV profile of cognition in schizophrenia,Natalie M Michel,"The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) has been used extensively to study impairment across a range of cognitive domains in schizophrenia. However, cognitive performance among those with the illness has yet to be examined using the newest edition of this measure. Hence, the current study aims first, to provide WAIS-IV normative data for Canadian individuals with schizophrenia of low average intelligence; second, to examine schizophrenia performance on all WAIS-IV subtest, index and general intelligence scores relative to healthy comparison subjects; and third, to revalidate the pattern of impairment identified in this clinical group using the WAIS-III, where processing speed (PS) was most affected, followed by working memory (WM), perceptual reasoning (PR) and verbal comprehension (VC). The WAIS-IV was administered to outpatients with schizophrenia and their performance compared with age, gender, and education matched controls. WAIS-IV schizophrenia performance data are provided. Analyses revealed significant impairment on several tasks, including the new Cancellation subtest and the VC supplemental subtest, Comprehension. At the index score level, group differences in PS were significantly larger than those observed in all other cognitive domains. Impairments were also observed in WM amid relatively preserved performance in VC, thereby confirming the pattern of impairment identified using the WAIS-III."
23443272,Associations between IQ and alcohol consumption in a population of young males: a large database analysis,Mario Müller,"Purpose: This study aimed at exploring the relationship between intelligence quotient (IQ) and alcohol consumption in a large sample of young males. This study explored whether IQ influences alcohol drinking and which pathways might be involved. We further hypothesized that IQ differences between lifetime abstainers and former drinkers exist, and that they primarily result from different group characteristics. Method: Within a psychiatric-epidemiological survey using a cross-sectional design IQ-tests were administered to approximately 50,000 Swiss conscripts at age of about 20 years. The sample was divided into four alcohol consumption categories (rare, occasional, moderate and daily drinking) and two non-drinker categories (former drinking and lifetime abstinence). Probabilities for different levels of consumption or former drinking against lifetime abstention in relation to IQ were estimated using multinomial logistic regression. Models were adjusted for education, disability pension, tobacco/cannabis use, migration, parental alcohol disorders, and mental health. Results: After adjusting for confounders full-scale IQ displayed positive associations with being a rare (OR 1.13; CI 95 % 1.07-1.19), occasional (OR 1.41; CI 95 % 1.33-1.48), and moderate drinker (OR 1.53; CI 95 % 1.45-1.62), and negative associations with being a former drinker (OR 0.85; CI 95 % 0.79-0.93). Daily drinking was positively associated only with the performance subscale IQ (OR 1.12; CI 95 % 1.02-1.22). Confounders contributed significantly to the IQ-alcohol association and, therefore, highlight the distinction of non-drinkers into lifetime abstainers and former drinkers. Conclusions: Our data confirmed the positive link between IQ and moderate drinking. Lower IQ in non-drinkers, however, seems to be related to earlier consumption and the presence of other risk factors."
23442984,Childhood clumsiness and peer victimization: a case-control study of psychiatric patients,Susanne Bejerot,"Background: Poor motor and social skills as well as peer victimization are commonly reported in both ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. Positive relationships between poor motor and poor social skills, and between poor social skills and peer victimization, are well documented, but the relationship between poor motor skills and peer victimization has not been studied in psychiatric populations. Method: 277 patients (133 males, 144 females), mean age 31 years, investigated for ADHD or autism spectrum disorder in adulthood and with normal intelligence, were interviewed about childhood peer victimization and examined for gross motor skills. The parents completed a comprehensive questionnaire on childhood problems, the Five to Fifteen. The Five to Fifteen is a validated questionnaire with 181 statements that covers various symptoms in childhood across eight different domains, one of them targeting motor skills. Regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between motor skills and the risk and duration of peer victimization, adjusted for sex and diagnosis. Results: Victims were described as more clumsy in childhood than their non-victimized counterparts. A significant independent association was found between reportedly poor childhood gross motor skills and peer victimization (adjusted odds ratio: 2.97 [95% confidence interval: 1.46-6.07], n = 235, p = 0.003). In adulthood, the victimized group performed worse on vertical jumps, a gross motor task, and were lonelier. Other factors that were expected to be associated with peer victimization were not found in this highly selected group. Conclusion: Poor gross motor skills constitute a strong and independent risk factor for peer victimization in childhood, regardless of sex, childhood psychiatric care and diagnosis."
23442277,Reliability of the ALPHA health-related fitness test battery in adolescents with Down syndrome,Carlos M Tejero-Gonzalez,"The Assessing Levels of Physical Activity (ALPHA) health-related fitness test battery is a set of reliable, valid, and feasible tests to assess health-related physical fitness in children and in adolescents. The aim of this study was to examine the reliability of this battery in adolescents with Down syndrome (DS). The extended ALPHA health-related fitness test battery was performed twice within 1 month in 17 apparently healthy adolescents, aged 12-18 years, with DS who had an intelligence quotient ≥ 35. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to determinate test-retest reliability, and nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare mean differences between measurements. With the exception of subscapular skinfold test, which obtained a moderate agreement (ICC = 0.64), all tests had a very high reliability: the 20-m shuttle-run test (ICC = 0.86), the right handgrip strength test (ICC = 0.86), the left handgrip strength test (ICC = 0.86), the standing broad jump test (ICC = 0.85), body mass index (ICC = 0.95), waist circumference (ICC = 0.98), triceps skinfold (ICC = 0.85), and the 4 × 10-m shuttle-run test (ICC = 0.92). There were no significant differences (all p > 0.05) in any of the tests. The ALPHA health-related fitness battery is reliable for measuring health-related components of fitness in adolescents with DS."
23440720,Executive functioning in older adults with hoarding disorder,Catherine R Ayers,"Background: Hoarding disorder (HD) is a chronic and debilitating psychiatric condition. Midlife HD patients have been found to have neurocognitive impairment, particularly in areas of executive functioning, but the extent to which this is due to comorbid psychiatric disorders has not been clear. Aims/method: The purpose of the present investigation was to examine executive functioning in geriatric HD patients without any comorbid Axis I disorders (n = 42) compared with a healthy older adult comparison group (n = 25). We hypothesized that older adults with HD would perform significantly worse on measures of executive functioning (Wisconsin Card Sort Task [Psychological Assessment Resources, Lutz, Florida, USA] ( Psychological Assessment Resources, 2003) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV digit span and letter-number sequencing tests [Pearson, San Antonio, TX, USA]). Results: Older adults with HD showed significant differences from healthy older controls in multiple aspects of executive functioning. Compared with healthy controls, older adults with HD committed significantly more total, non-perseverative errors and conceptual level responses on the Wisconsin Card Sort Task and had significantly worse performance on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV digit span and letter-number sequencing tests. Hoarding symptom severity was strongly correlated with executive dysfunction in the HD group. Conclusions: Compared with demographically-matched controls, older adults with HD have dysfunction in several domains of executive functioning including mental control, working memory, inhibition, and set shifting. Executive dysfunction is strongly correlated with hoarding severity and is not because of comorbid psychiatric disorders in HD patients. These results have broad clinical implications suggesting that executive functioning should be assessed and taken into consideration when developing intervention strategies for older adults with HD."
23440431,Association of the COMT Met¹⁵⁸ allele with trait impulsivity in healthy young adults,Márcio Gerhardt Soeiro-De-Souza,"Dopamine (DA) is considered to be an important neurotransmitter in the control of impulsive behavior, however, its underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a key enzyme in the catabolism of DA within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and has been suggested to play a role in the mediation of impulsive behavior. The COMT single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4680 (Val158Met) Met allele has been shown to decrease COMT enzyme activity and is associated with improved PFC cognitive function (intelligence and executive functions). Studies have associated the rs4680 genotype with impulsivity as a symptom in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and substance abuse. However, only a few studies have assessed the effects of rs4680 on impulsiveness in healthy subjects, the results of which remain controversial. The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) was applied to 82 healthy volunteers (including 42 females) who were genotyped for COMT rs4680. Subjects carrying the Met/Met genotype scored higher for the BIS-11 second-order factor Non-planning than carriers of the Val/Val genotype. No interaction between gender genotype was detected. Age, gender and education had no effect on the results. The COMT rs4680 Met/Met genotype was associated with higher impulsivity on the BIS-11 second-order factor Non-planning. These results suggest that COMT enzyme activity may be important in the regulation of impulsiveness among young adults. Further studies involving larger samples should be conducted to confirm the results of the present study."
23438160,Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 4th edition-Chinese version index scores in Taiwanese children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,Pinchen Yang,"Aim: The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 4th edition-Chinese version (WISC-IV-Chinese) has been in clinical use in Taiwan since 2007. Research is needed to determine how the WISC-IV, modified from its earlier version, will affect its interpretation in clinical practice in a Mandarin-speaking context. Methods: We attempted to use WISC-IV-Chinese scores to identify the cognitive strengths and weaknesses in 334 Taiwanese children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Comparison of cognitive profiles of WISC-IV-Chinese scores between subtypes of ADHD was also performed. Results: The results indicated that the four-factor model of the WISC-IV-Chinese fitted well for Taiwanese children with ADHD. The profiles showed that performance in the index score of the Processing Speed Index was the weakness domain for the Taiwanese children with ADHD, as confirmed by two different kinds of analytic methods. Cognitive profile analysis of ADHD subtypes revealed children with inattentive subtypes to have a greater weakness in processing speed performance. Conclusion: The implications of the profiles of the index scores on the WISC-IV-Chinese version for Taiwanese children with ADHD were explored."
23437778,Computer use and letter knowledge in pre-school children: a population-based study,Anne Castles,"Aim: To explore the link between pre-school children's general home computer use and their letter knowledge. Methods: As part of the Early Language in Victoria Study, a community cohort of 1539 four-year-old children was tested on letter knowledge as well as on non-verbal intelligence, oral language, articulation and phonological awareness. Performance on these measures was examined in relation to parent-questionnaire responses exploring home literacy environment and the amount of time children spent using the computer. Results: A positive correlation between computer use and letter knowledge was found, and this association was still evident after controlling for other cognitive and environmental factors known to predict the development of letter knowledge in young children. Conclusions: Greater computer use in pre-school children appears to have a positive association with emerging literacy development. Future research needs to examine the nature of that association."
23434917,Pitch discrimination without awareness in congenital amusia: evidence from event-related potentials,Patricia Moreau,"Congenital amusia is a lifelong disorder characterized by a difficulty in perceiving and producing music despite normal intelligence and hearing. Behavioral data have indicated that it originates from a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination, and is expressed by the absence of a P3b event-related brain response for pitch differences smaller than a semitone and a bigger N2b-P3b brain response for large pitch differences as compared to controls. However, it is still unclear why the amusic brain overreacts to large pitch changes. Furthermore, another electrophysiological study indicates that the amusic brain can respond to changes in melodies as small as a quarter-tone, without awareness, by exhibiting a normal mismatch negativity (MMN) brain response. Here, we re-examine the event-related N2b-P3b components with the aim to clarify the cause of the larger amplitude observed by Peretz, Brattico, and Tervaniemi (2005), by experimentally matching the number of deviants presented to the controls according to the number of deviants detected by amusics. We also re-examine the MMN component as well as the N1 in an acoustical context to investigate further the pitch discrimination deficit underlying congenital amusia. In two separate conditions, namely ignore and attend, we measured the MMN, the N1, the N2b and the P3b to tones that deviated by an eight of a tone (25 cents) or whole tone (200 cents) from a repeated standard tone. The results show a normal MMN, a seemingly normal N1, a normal P3b for the 200 cents pitch deviance, and no P3b for the small 25 cents pitch differences in amusics. These results indicate that the amusic brain responds to small pitch differences at a pre-attentive level of perception, but is unable to detect consciously those same pitch deviances at a later attentive level. The results are consistent with previous MRI and fMRI studies indicating that the auditory cortex of amusic individuals is functioning normally."
23434294,Cognitive outcome after epilepsy surgery in children,Monique M J Van Schooneveld,"The ultimate goal of epilepsy surgery in young children is to stop seizures, interrupt the downhill course of the epileptic encephalopathy, and improve developmental capacities. Postoperative outcome after childhood epilepsy surgery should therefore not only be expressed in terms of seizure freedom, cognitive outcome is an equally important outcome measure. Insight in the mutually dependent variables that can determine pre and postoperative cognitive developmental abilities will improve prediction of outcome and presurgical counseling of parents. The purpose of this review is to discuss the literature regarding cognitive outcome and the predictors of postoperative cognitive functioning after epilepsy surgery in children, particularly those with ""catastrophic"" epilepsy. There are only few studies in which the relation between possible determinants and cognitive outcome or change was statistically tested in a multivariable manner. Duration of epilepsy, presurgical Developmental Quotient (DQ) or Intelligence Quotient (IQ), and postoperative seizure freedom were the only factors reported in different studies to be independently related to eventual cognitive outcome after epilepsy surgery. Underlying etiology, gender, age at surgery, presurgical DQ/IQ, postoperative seizure freedom, cessation of antiepileptic medication, and follow-up interval have all been described in different surgical cohorts to be independently related to a postoperative change of IQ or DQ scores. To appreciate how each of the pre-epileptic, presurgical, and postoperative variables may independently influence eventual cognitive outcome and postoperative cognitive improvement, we need multicenter studies with large homogenous surgical populations, using standardized tests and multivariable analyses."
23432661,Sleep and cognition in preschool years: specific links to executive functioning,Annie Bernier,"This study investigated the prospective links between sleep in infancy and preschoolers' cognitive performance. Mothers of 65 infants completed a sleep diary when infants were aged 1 year, and children completed two subscales of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence at 4 years, indexing general cognitive ability and complex executive functioning. Consistent with hypotheses, children getting higher proportions of their sleep at night as infants were found to perform better on executive functions, but did not show better general cognition. Relations held after controlling for family socioeconomic status and prior cognitive functioning. These findings suggest that the special importance of sleep for higher order cognition, documented among adults, may appear very early in life."
23431661,Parting the cloud s: a vision of supervision of midwifery,Jen Leamon,"This paper describes a response to the evidence that midwives often have a limited view of the roles and responsibilities of the supervisor of midwives (SoM) and SoM team. Using a creative approach (word clouds) and midwife/SoM stories, the importance of relationships which are supportive of midwives, women and normality is highlighted. Emotional intelligence and interprofessional communication are also shown to be key aspects of the role. Supervision has an important role to play in supporting midwives' development, promoting normality and generally protecting midwives and the public. Reflection using creative media can contribute to this."
23431488,Positron emission tomography-computer tomography scan used as a monitoring tool following cellular therapy in cerebral palsy and mental retardation-a case report,Alok Sharma,"Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the non-progressive neurological diseases caused by damage to the brain tissue at birth, which leads to physical, cognitive and perceptive symptoms. Even after lifelong medical and therapeutic management there are residual deficits which affect the quality of life of the patients and their families. We examined a maximally rehabilitated, 20 year old male suffering from CP and Mental Retardation (MR). He had diplegic gait and Intelligence Quotient (IQ) score of 44 with affected fine motor activities, balance, speech and higher functions. Positron Emission Tomography-Computer Tomography (PET-CT) scan identified frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, left cerebellar lobes, amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampus as the affected areas. He was treated with cellular therapy of Autologous Bone Marrow Derived Mono-Nuclear Cells (MNCs) transplantation followed by multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Six months following therapy, PET-CT scan showed significant increase in metabolic activity in all four lobes, mesial temporal structures and left cerebellar hemisphere, also supported by clinical improvement in IQ, social behavior, speech, balance and daily functioning. These findings provide preliminary evidence to support the efficacy of cellular therapy for the treatment of CP with MR. PET-CT scan can also be viewed as an impressive tool to monitor the effects of cellular therapy."
23430043,"Semantics, pragmatics, and formal thought disorders in people with schizophrenia",Carlos Salavera,"Background: The aim of this study was to analyze how formal thought disorders (FTD) affect semantics and pragmatics in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: The sample comprised subjects with schizophrenia (n = 102) who met the criteria for the disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition Text Revision. In the research process, the following scales were used: Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for psychopathology measurements; the Scale for the Assessment of Thought, Language, and Communication (TLC) for FTD, Word Accentuation Test (WAT), System for the Behavioral Evaluation of Social Skills (SECHS), the pragmatics section of the Objective Criteria Language Battery (BLOC-SR) and the verbal sections of the Wechsler Adults Intelligence Scale (WAIS) III, for assessment of semantics and pragmatics. Results: The results in the semantics and pragmatics sections were inferior to the average values obtained in the general population. Our data demonstrated that the more serious the FTD, the worse the performances in the Verbal-WAIS tests (particularly in its vocabulary, similarities, and comprehension sections), SECHS, and BLOC-SR, indicating that FTD affects semantics and pragmatics, although the results of the WAT indicated good premorbid language skills. Conclusion: The principal conclusion we can draw from this study is the evidence that in schizophrenia the superior level of language structure seems to be compromised, and that this level is related to semantics and pragmatics; when there is an alteration in this level, symptoms of FTD appear, with a wide-ranging relationship between both language and FTD. The second conclusion is that the subject's language is affected by the disorder and rules out the possibility of a previous verbal impairment."
23429930,Software sensors for biomass concentration in a SSC process using artificial neural networks and support vector machine,Gonzalo Acuña,"The lack of sensors for some relevant state variables in fermentation processes can be coped by developing appropriate software sensors. In this work, NARX-ANN, NARMAX-ANN, NARX-SVM and NARMAX-SVM models are compared when acting as software sensors of biomass concentration for a solid substrate cultivation (SSC) process. Results show that NARMAX-SVM outperforms the other models with an SMAPE index under 9 for a 20 % amplitude noise. In addition, NARMAX models perform better than NARX models under the same noise conditions because of their better predictive capabilities as they include prediction errors as inputs. In the case of perturbation of initial conditions of the autoregressive variable, NARX models exhibited better convergence capabilities. This work also confirms that a difficult to measure variable, like biomass concentration, can be estimated on-line from easy to measure variables like CO₂ and O₂ using an adequate software sensor based on computational intelligence techniques."
23427776,Stability of WISC-IV process scores,Joseph J Ryan,"Forty-three students were administered on two occasions approximately 11 months apart the complete Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition, including the seven process components of Block Design No Time Bonus, Digit Span Forward (DSF), Digit Span Backward (DSB), Cancellation Random (CAR), Cancellation Structured (CAS), Longest Digit Span Forward (LDSF), and Longest Digit Span Backward (LDSB). Mean ages at first and second testing were 7.77 years (SD = 1.91) and 8.74 years (SD = 1.93), respectively. Mean Full-Scale IQ at initial testing was 111.63 (SD = 10.71). Process score stability coefficients ranged from .75 on DSF to .32 on CAS. Discrepancy score stabilities ranged from .45 on DSF minus DSB to .05 on CAS minus CAR. Approximately 21% of participants increased their LDSF on retest, and 16.3% showed a gain on LDSB. Caution must be exercised when interpreting process scores, and interpretation of discrepancy scores should probably be avoided."
23427770,Long-term cognitive sequelae: abused children without PTSD,Robert B Perna,"Many lines of research suggest that childhood abuse and neglect are associated with later developing psychiatric diagnoses, academic problems, cognitive difficulty, and possible brain changes as measured through brain imaging. Data were collected on children (N = 41) who completed a neuropsychological evaluation. Of those evaluated, 18 had a documented history of physical and/or emotional abuse or significant neglect and 23 had no history of abuse/neglect. When controlling for Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ), the abused children had significantly lower scores on measures of executive functioning (Wisconsin Card-Sorting Test-Categories, Maintenance of Set, and Perseveration and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition Working Memory), and effect sizes were large for these variables. Neither group had any test scores significantly lower than their FSIQ. Cross-tabulation analyses showed that the abused children were more likely to subsequently be diagnosed with a behavioral or emotional disorder. Consistent with psychobiological theories and imaging studies, our data are suggestive that childhood abuse and neglect are associated with later development of behavioral and emotional disorders and areas of cognitive weakness and possible impairment. Future research may be conducted to clarify these effects, the possibility of a dose-effect relationship, and timing of possible critical periods of brain vulnerability."
23426786,The value of enrichment to reintroduction success,Richard P Reading,"Reintroduction attempts have faced low, albeit improving, success rates, especially for threatened and endangered species reintroduced from captivity to the wild. This is not only a concern for conservation, as the low success of reintroduction also implies an animal welfare issue for the individuals concerned. Success rates are particularly low for species that live in complex social structures, require greater training during development, and exhibit higher levels of intelligence. Aside from mitigating the original cause of a species extirpation from an area, behavior factors arguably represent the most important aspect influencing an animal's survival following reintroduction. Indeed, we previously recommended using behavioral indicators for determining relative reintroduction success, especially as practitioners develop and compare protocols or if survivorship is difficult to gauge. Strategic enrichment programs targeted toward developing specific skills important for survival in the wild promise to improve reintroduction success by providing individuals with opportunities to develop and improve behavioral skills, such as avoiding predation, foraging (especially for predators and primates), interacting in social groups, courtship and mating, habitat selection, and learning movement and migration routes. Enrichment also improves the physical condition of most individuals, which should also increase reintroduction success. Last but not least, such programs offer the prospect of improved animal welfare both pre- and post-release. We explore how behavioral enrichment has influenced reintroduction success and welfare in a variety of different species."
23426257,Planform: an application and database of graph-encoded planarian regenerative experiments,Daniel Lobo,"Summary: Understanding the mechanisms governing the regeneration capabilities of many organisms is a fundamental interest in biology and medicine. An ever-increasing number of manipulation and molecular experiments are attempting to discover a comprehensive model for regeneration, with the planarian flatworm being one of the most important model species. Despite much effort, no comprehensive, constructive, mechanistic models exist yet, and it is now clear that computational tools are needed to mine this huge dataset. However, until now, there is no database of regenerative experiments, and the current genotype-phenotype ontologies and databases are based on textual descriptions, which are not understandable by computers. To overcome these difficulties, we present here Planform (Planarian formalization), a manually curated database and software tool for planarian regenerative experiments, based on a mathematical graph formalism. The database contains more than a thousand experiments from the main publications in the planarian literature. The software tool provides the user with a graphical interface to easily interact with and mine the database. The presented system is a valuable resource for the regeneration community and, more importantly, will pave the way for the application of novel artificial intelligence tools to extract knowledge from this dataset. Availability: The database and software tool are freely available at http://planform.daniel-lobo.com."
23425923,Plant intelligence and attention,Michael Marder,"This article applies the phenomenological model of attention to plant monitoring of environmental stimuli and signal perception. Three complementary definitions of attention as selectivity, modulation and perdurance are explained with reference to plant signaling and behaviors, including foraging, ramet placement and abiotic stress communication. Elements of animal and human attentive attitudes are compared with plant attention at the levels of cognitive focus, context and margin. It is argued that the concept of attention holds the potential of becoming a cornerstone of plant intelligence studies."
23425631,Choline intake during pregnancy and child cognition at age 7 years,Caroline E Boeke,"Animal models indicate that exposure to choline in utero improves visual memory through cholinergic transmission and/or epigenetic mechanisms. Among 895 mothers in Project Viva (eastern Massachusetts, 1999-2002 to 2008-2011), we estimated the associations between intakes of choline, vitamin B12, betaine, and folate during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy and offspring visual memory (measured by the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning, Second Edition (WRAML2), Design and Picture Memory subtests) and intelligence (measured using the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition (KBIT-2)) at age 7 years. Mean second-trimester intakes were 328 (standard deviation (SD), 63) mg/day for choline, 10.5 (SD, 5.1) µg/day for vitamin B12, 240 (SD, 104) mg/day for betaine, and 1,268 (SD, 381) µg/day for folate. Mean age 7 test scores were 17.2 (SD, 4.4) points on the WRAML 2 Design and Picture Memory subtests, 114.3 (SD, 13.9) points on the verbal KBIT-2, and 107.8 (SD, 16.5) points on the nonverbal KBIT-2. In a model adjusting for maternal characteristics, the other nutrients, and child's age and sex, the top quartile of second-trimester choline intake was associated with a child WRAML2 score 1.4 points higher (95% confidence interval: 0.5, 2.4) than the bottom quartile (P-trend = 0.003). Results for first-trimester intake were in the same direction but weaker. Intake of the other nutrients was not associated with the cognitive tests administered. Higher gestational choline intake was associated with modestly better child visual memory at age 7 years."
23425395,"Normative data for IQ, height and head circumference for children in Saudi Arabia",Adel A Batterjee,"Normative data are reported for intelligence, height and head circumference for a sample of 1553 6- to 15-year-olds in Saudi Arabia, and for the correlations between these variables. Intelligence was tested with the Standard Progressive Matrices, on which the Saudi sample obtained a British IQ of 76.2. There were no significant differences in means between boys and girls and differences in variability were inconsistent. The heights of the Saudi sample were generally lower than those of the American norms. The differences in head circumferences between the Saudi children and the American norms were inconsistent. Correlations between IQ and height were weaker than those found in other studies but correlations between IQ and head circumference were positive."
23423918,Risk factors for adverse neurocognitive outcomes in school-aged patients after the Fontan operation,Ai Sugimoto,"Objectives: As the surgical results for Fontan candidates improve, much attention has been given to the long-term cognitive outcomes. This study aimed to assess the neurocognitive outcomes after Fontan completion, and to determine the factors associated with an extremely low intelligence quotient (IQ <70). Methods: A total of 70 local eligible school-aged patients were enrolled in the study (hypoplastic left heart syndrome, 17; right atrial isomerism, 15 and others, 38). Fontan operations were performed at a median age of 1.8 (range, 0.5-8.9) years (primary Fontan, 4 of 70 [6%]). The Wechsler Intelligence Test was taken at a median age of 9 (range, 5.1-14.4) years for the purpose of neurocognitive evaluation. Patients' data were collected from medical records, and a retrospective analysis of potential predictors for an IQ <70 was performed. Results: The median full-scale IQ (FSIQ) for the entire cohort was 85 (range, 43-118). Of the lower order composites, the perceptual reasoning index and the working memory index were significantly lower in low-FSIQ patients (P < 0.05). Overall, 15 of 70 (21%) of the cohort had an IQ <70. Univariate analysis identified three significant risk factors for FSIQ <70 (15 of 70, 21%): body weight <2.5 kg at initial palliative surgery (P < 0.05), low 5-min Apgar score <4 (P < 0.05) and inter-stage events requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (P < 0.05). No other patient-specific factors (e.g. cardiac morphology) or modifiable surgical factors (e.g. the use of hypothermic cardiac arrest) were associated with FSIQ <70. Conclusions: Low body weight (<2.5 kg) at initial operation, low 5-min Apgar score (<4) and inter-stage CPR were significant risk factors for impaired neurocognitive outcomes. An evolving strategy for preventing inter-stage CPR may improve cognitive outcomes."
23423686,Predictive models in urology,Andrea Cestari,"Predictive modeling is emerging as an important knowledge-based technology in healthcare. The interest in the use of predictive modeling reflects advances on different fronts such as the availability of health information from increasingly complex databases and electronic health records, a better understanding of causal or statistical predictors of health, disease processes and multifactorial models of ill-health and developments in nonlinear computer models using artificial intelligence or neural networks. These new computer-based forms of modeling are increasingly able to establish technical credibility in clinical contexts. The current state of knowledge is still quite young in understanding the likely future direction of how this so-called 'machine intelligence' will evolve and therefore how current relatively sophisticated predictive models will evolve in response to improvements in technology, which is advancing along a wide front. Predictive models in urology are gaining progressive popularity not only for academic and scientific purposes but also into the clinical practice with the introduction of several nomograms dealing with the main fields of onco-urology."
23422941,The intellectual disability of trisomy 21: differences in gene expression in a case series of patients with lower and higher IQ,André Mégarbané,"Trisomy 21 (T21), or Down syndrome (DS), is the most frequent and recognizable cause of intellectual disabilities. The level of disability, as evaluated by the intelligence quotient (IQ) test, varies considerably between patients independent of other factors. To determine the genetic or molecular basis of this difference, a high throughput transcriptomic analysis was performed on twenty T21 patients with high and low IQ, and 10 healthy controls using Digital Gene Expression. More than 90 millions of tags were sequenced in the three libraries. A total of 80 genes of potential interest were selected for the qPCR experiment validation, and three housekeeping genes were used for normalizing purposes. HLA DQA1 and HLA DRB1 were significantly downregulated among the patients with a low IQ, the values found in the healthy controls being intermediate between those noted in the IQ+ and IQ- T21 patients. Interestingly, the intergenic region between these genes contains a binding sequence for the CCCTC-binding factor, or CTCF, and cohesin (a multisubunit complex), both of which are essential for expression of HLA DQA1 and HLA DRB1 and numerous other genes. Our results might lead to the discovery of genes, or genetic markers, that are directly involved in several phenotypes of DS and, eventually, to the identification of potential targets for therapeutic interventions."
23422865,The role of patient involvement in the diagnostic process in internal medicine: a cognitive approach,Claudio Lucchiari,"Much cognitive and clinical research has addressed clinical reasoning, pointing out that physicians often have difficulties in following a linear course when making accurate diagnoses. Some authors suspect that physicians make mistakes because they unknowingly fail to observe the laws of formal logic and that their reasoning becomes influenced by contextual factors. In this paper, we introduce some basic principles of the cognitive approach to medical decision making and we describe the cognitive balanced model. Then we discuss the relationship between construction of mental models, cognitive biases and patient involvement by the use of a clinical vignette. Medical decisions may be considered fundamentally biased since the use of judgment heuristics and a combination of cognitive-related and system-related factors limit physicians' rationality. While traditional understanding of clinical reasoning has failed to consider contextual factors, most techniques designed to avoid biases seem to fail in promoting sound and safer medical practice. In particular, we argue that an unbiased process requires the use of a cognitive balanced model, in which analytical and intuitive mind skills should be properly integrated. In order to improve medical decision making and thereby lessen incidence of adverse events, it is fundamental to include the patient perspective in a balanced model. Physicians and patients should improve their collective intelligence by sharing mental models within a framework of distributed intelligence."
23421857,School-age effects of the newborn individualized developmental care and assessment program for preterm infants with intrauterine growth restriction: preliminary findings,Gloria McAnulty,"Background: The experience in the newborn intensive care nursery results in premature infants' neurobehavioral and neurophysiological dysfunction and poorer brain structure. Preterms with severe intrauterine growth restriction are doubly jeopardized given their compromised brains. The Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program improved outcome at early school-age for preterms with appropriate intrauterine growth. It also showed effectiveness to nine months for preterms with intrauterine growth restriction. The current study tested effectiveness into school-age for preterms with intrauterine growth restriction regarding executive function (EF), electrophysiology (EEG) and neurostructure (MRI). Methods: Twenty-three 9-year-old former growth-restricted preterms, randomized at birth to standard care (14 controls) or to the Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program (9 experimentals) were assessed with standardized measures of cognition, achievement, executive function, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The participating children were comparable to those lost to follow-up, and the controls to the experimentals, in terms of newborn background health and demographics. All outcome measures were corrected for mother's intelligence. Analysis techniques included two-group analysis of variance and stepwise discriminate analysis for the outcome measures, Wilks' lambda and jackknifed classification to ascertain two-group classification success per and across domains; canonical correlation analysis to explore relationships among neuropsychological, electrophysiological and neurostructural domains at school-age, and from the newborn period to school-age. Results: Controls and experimentals were comparable in age at testing, anthropometric and health parameters, and in cognitive and achievement scores. Experimentals scored better in executive function, spectral coherence, and cerebellar volumes. Furthermore, executive function, spectral coherence and brain structural measures discriminated controls from experimentals. Executive function correlated with coherence and brain structure measures, and with newborn-period neurobehavioral assessment. Conclusion: The intervention in the intensive care nursery improved executive function as well as spectral coherence between occipital and frontal as well as parietal regions. The experimentals' cerebella were significantly larger than the controls'. These results, while preliminary, point to the possibility of long-term brain improvement even of intrauterine growth compromised preterms if individualized intervention begins with admission to the NICU and extends throughout transition home. Larger sample replications are required in order to confirm these results. Clinical trial registration: The study is registered as a clinical trial. The trial registration number is NCT00914108."
23421635,Profiles of cognitive functioning in a population-based sample of centenarians using factor mixture analysis,Adam Davey,"BACKGROUND/STUDY CONTEXT: The goal of the study was to identify and characterize latent profiles (clusters) of cognitive functioning in centenarians and the psychometric properties of cognitive measures within them. Methods: Data were collected from cross-sectional, population-based sample of 244 centenarians (aged 98 to 108, 15.8% men, 20.5% African American, 38.0% community-dwelling) from 44 counties in northern Georgia participating in the Georgia Centenarian Study (2001-2008). Measures included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III Similarities subtest (WAIS), Hand Tapping, Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale (BDS), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and Fuld Object Memory Evaluation (FOME). The Global Deterioration Rating Scale (GDRS) was used to independently evaluate criterion-related validity for distinguishing cognitively normal and impaired groups. Relevant covariates included directly assessed functional status for basic and instrumental activities of daily living (DAFS), race, gender, educational attainment, Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form (GDS), and vision and hearing problems. Results: Results suggest two distinct classes of cognitive performance in this centenarian sample. Approximately one third of the centenarians show a pattern of markedly lower cognitive performance on most measures. Group membership is independently well predicted (area under the curve [AUC] = .83) by GDRS scores (sensitivity 67.7%, specificity 82.4%). Membership in the lower cognitive performance group was more likely for individuals who were older, African Americans, had more depressive symptoms, lower plasma folate, carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, facility residents, and individuals who died in the 2 years following interview. Conclusions: In a population expected to have high prevalence of dementia, latent subtypes can be distinguished via factor mixture analysis that provide normative values for cognitive functioning. The present study allows estimates for normative cognitive performance in this age group."
23421402,Social judgment of aggressive language: effects of target and sender sex on the evaluation of slurs,Mons Bendixen,"We investigated the influence of the sex of the target and the sex of the sender on the judgment of slurs (verbal derogation). From previous research, we selected and clustered slurs into seven categories and respondents rated their degree of perceived insult in two consecutive questionnaire surveys (N = 281 and N = 224, respectively). Results confirm that slurs are generally judged as being more insulting when directed towards females than towards males. In comparison, differences in sex of sender were small. When directed towards females, slurs referring to ""being loose"" were rated as the most insulting. For both target sexes, remarks referring to homosexuality and physical unattractiveness were among those rated as the most insulting. Least insulting were slurs referring to unethical acts, lack of intelligence and cowardliness. A sex of respondent effect was found, suggesting that women rated slurs generally more insulting than men. The pattern of results showed considerable stability across surveys attesting for the reliability of the method for measuring the social evaluation of slurs."
23420272,Artificial intelligence techniques: An efficient new approach to challenge the assessment of complex clinical fields such as airway clearance techniques in patients with cystic fibrosis?,Titus Slavici,"Objective: To construct an artificial intelligence application to assist untrained physiotherapists in determining the appropriate physiotherapy exercises to improve the quality of life of patients with cystic fibrosis. Subjects: A total of 42 children (21 boys and 21 girls), age range 6-18 years, participated in a clinical survey between 2001 and 2005. Methods: Data collected during the clinical survey were entered into a neural network in order to correlate the health state indicators of the patients and the type of physiotherapy exercise to be followed. Cross-validation of the network was carried out by comparing the health state indicators achieved after following a certain physiotherapy exercise and the health state indicators predicted by the network. Results: The lifestyle and health state indicators of the survey participants improved. The network predicted the health state indicators of the participants with an accuracy of 93%. The results of the cross-validation test were within the error margins of the real-life indicators. Conclusion: Using data on the clinical state of individuals with cystic fibrosis, it is possible to determine the most effective type of physiotherapy exercise for improving overall health state indicators."
23419242,The influence of sex on cognitive insight and neurocognitive functioning in schizophrenia,Yu-Chen Kao,"Both impaired insight and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are core features of this disorder. Previous studies have demonstrated the complex relationships between neurocognition and cognitive insight, as well as the contribution of neurocognition in explaining cognitive insight. However, there is lack of research regarding the influences of sex on the relation of neurocognition and cognitive insight. The present study sought to elucidate sex differences in cognitive insight and neurocognition in schizophrenia. Seventy three outpatients (male=39) with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were enrolled in the cross-sectional study. The participants were assessed with cognitive insight using the Beck Cognitive Insight Scale, executive functions using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, sustained attention using the Conner's Continuous Performance Test (Second Edition), and intelligence using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third version, respectively. Sex differences in demographic and clinical variables were small; nevertheless, female patients had significantly later age of illness onset and higher levels of formal education than males (p<0.05). Poor cognitive insight was attributed to impairment in performance of executive function and sustained attention. Results from hierarchical regression analyses indicated sex as a moderator only in the association between cognitive insight and executive function. Our findings support an association between poor cognitive insight and neurocognitive impairment in outpatients with schizophrenia and suggest that the relationship may be sex-specific. This study highlights potential targets for effective intervention and rehabilitation in improving patients' insight toward mental illness."
23417586,"Short- and long-term outcomes at 2, 5 and 8 years old for neonates at borderline viability--an 11-year experience",Woei Bing Poon,"Introduction: Neurodevelopmental outcome of borderline viability neonates have lagged behind improvement in survival figures. Accurate figures based on local outcome allow us to better counsel parents and to prognosticate with greater accuracy on both short- and longterm outcomes. Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort study of 101 consecutively born neonates, born from 21 to 26 weeks gestation over an 11-year period from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 2005 was conducted. Long-term outcomes were assessed at 2, 5 and 8 years of age in terms of mental developmental index (MDI) or intelligence quotient (IQ) scores, hearing and visual impairments, handicaps and impairments, school placement and interventions required. Results: Survival rates were 20.0%, 60.9%, 70.4% and 73.2% for neonates born at 21 to 23, 24, 25 and 26 weeks gestation respectively. Factors that predicted increased mortality included higher alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (AaDO2) with odds ratio (OR) 1.005 and lower birth weight OR 0.993. Rates of severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (stage 3 or worse) were 100%, 57.1%, 42.1% and 26.7% for 21 to 23, 24, 25 and 26 weeks gestation respectively. Rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) were 100.0%, 57.1%, 63.2% and 60.0% respectively. Rates of severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) were 0%, 7.1%, 5.3% and 10.0% respectively. Moderate to severe disability rates at 2 years old were 100%, 44.4%, 33.3% and 30.4% respectively. At 5 years old, moderate to severe disability rates were 16.7%, 22.2% and 14.3% respectively for those born at 24, 25 and 26 weeks gestation. Interpretation at 8 years was limited by small numbers. Conclusion: Our results indicated that local figures for mortality and morbidity remained high at the limits of viability, although they were comparable to outcomes for large scale studies in advanced countries."
23417137,Relationship between poor sleep and daytime cognitive performance in young adults with autism,Élyse Limoges,"Poor sleep is a common feature in autism even though patients themselves do not necessarily complain. The impact of poor sleep on daytime cognitive functioning in autism is not well-known and we therefore investigated whether sleep in autism correlates with daytime cognitive performance. A battery of non-verbal tasks was administered, in the morning after a second night of sleep in the laboratory, to 17 young adults with autism and normal intelligence, and 14 typically developed individuals matched for age and IQ; none of the participants complained about sleep problems. Two dimensions of attention (sustained and selective) and 4 types of memory (working, declarative, sensory-motor and cognitive procedural) were tested. Individuals with autism showed clear signs of poor sleep. Their performance differed from the controls in response speed but not in accuracy. Signs of poor sleep in the autism group were significantly correlated with either normal performance (selective attention and declarative memory) or performance inferior to that of the controls (sensory-motor and cognitive procedural memories). Both groups presented a significant negative correlation between slow-wave sleep (SWS) and learning a sensory-motor procedural memory task. Only control participants showed a positive association between SWS duration and number of figures recalled on the declarative memory task. Correlation patterns differed between groups when sleep spindles were considered: they were negatively associated with number of trials needed to learn the sensory-motor procedural memory task in autism and with reaction time and number of errors on selective attention in the controls. Correlation between rapid eye movements (REMs) in REM sleep and cognitive procedural memory was not significant. We conclude that some signs reflecting the presence of poor sleep in adults with high-functioning autism correlate with various aspects of motor output on non-verbal performance tasks. The question is raised whether poor sleep in non-complaining persons with autism should be treated."
23416249,Long term neurocognitive impact of low dose prenatal methylmercury exposure in Hong Kong,Hugh Simon Lam,"Background: International studies suggest that low dose prenatal methylmercury exposure (>29 nmol/L) has long-term adverse neurocognitive effects. There is evidence that the majority of children in Hong Kong exceed this level as a result of high fish consumption of mothers during pregnancy. Objective: To study whether there are any associations between low-dose prenatal methylmercury exposure and neurocognitive outcomes in Hong Kong children. Materials and methods: All 1057 children from the original birth cohort were eligible for entry into the study, except children with conditions that would affect neurocognitive development, but were unrelated to methylmercury exposure. Subjects were assessed by a wide panel of tests covering a broad range of neurocognitive functions: Hong Kong Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (HK-WISC), Hong Kong List Learning Test (HKLLT), Tests of Everyday Attention for Children (TEACH), Boston Naming Test, and Grooved Pegboard Test. Results: 608 subjects were recruited (median age 8.2 years, IQR 7.3, 8.8; 53.9% boys). After correction by confounders including child age and sex, multivariate analysis showed that cord blood mercury concentration was significantly associated with three subtests: Picture Arrangement of HK-WISC (coefficient -0.944, P=0.049) and Short and Long Delay Recall Difference of the HKLLT (coefficient -1.087, P=0.007 and coefficient -1.161, P=0.005, respectively), i.e., performance worsened with increasing prenatal methylmercury exposure in these subtests. Conclusions: Small, but statistically significant adverse associations between prenatal methylmercury exposure and long-term neurocognitive effects (a visual sequencing task and retention ability of verbal memory) were found in our study. These effects are compatible with findings of studies with higher prenatal methylmercury exposure levels and suggest that safe strategies to further reduce exposure levels in Hong Kong are desirable."
23415589,Sheepskin effects of education in the 10-year Framingham risk of coronary heart disease,Sze Yan Liu,"While the association between education and adult health is well documented, it is unclear whether quantity (i.e. years of schooling) or credentials (i.e. degrees) drive this association. Individuals with degrees may have better health than their non-credentialed counterparts given similar years of schooling, the so-called ""sheepskin"" effect. This paper contributes to this line of inquiry by examining associations of educational degree and years of schooling with the Framingham Risk Score, a measure of 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), using data from a unique birth cohort (the New England Family Study; participants mean age 42 years) with prospective information on childhood health and intelligence quotient (IQ). According to our results, years of schooling were inversely associated with 10-year CHD risk in the unadjusted model but not in the fully adjusted models that included degree attainment. By contrast, associations between degree attainment and 10-year CHD risk remained significant in the fully adjusted models that included years of schooling. College degree holders had 10-year CHD risk 19% (95% CI: -33%, -2%) lower than individuals with HS degrees or less in the fully adjusted models. Subanalyses evaluating sheepskin effects on the individual components of the 10-year CHD risk algorithm showed the expected education gradient was generally noted for each of the individual components, with decreasing prevalence of ""high risk"" values associated with higher degree credentials. Our results suggest educational credentials provide an additional benefit to risk of coronary heart disease beyond schooling."
23415587,The scarring effect of unemployment throughout adulthood on psychological distress at age 50: estimates controlling for early adulthood distress and childhood psychological factors,M Daly,"Unemployment is an established predictor of psychological distress. Despite this robust relationship, the long-term impact of unemployment on human welfare has been examined in relatively few studies. In this investigation we test the association between the life-time duration of unemployment over a 34 year period from 1974 to 2008 and psychological distress at age 50 years in a sample of 6253 British adults who took part in the National Child Development Study (NCDS). In addition to adjusting for demographic characteristics, we account for the role of childhood psychological factors, which have been shown to predict adult occupational and mental health outcomes and may determine the connection between unemployment and distress. We find that intelligence and behavioral/emotional problems at age 11 predict both unemployment and psychological distress later in life. Furthermore, as predicted, the duration of unemployment throughout adulthood was associated with elevated levels of psychological distress at age 50, after adjusting for demographic characteristics including labor force status at age 50. The emotional impact of unemployment was only marginally attenuated by the inclusion of childhood factors and early-life distress levels in the analyses. Thus, unemployment may lead to worsening distress levels that persist over time and which cannot be attributed to childhood or early-life well-being or cognitive functioning early in life. Our analysis further supports the idea of psychological scarring from unemployment and the importance of employment outcomes for adult well-being."
23414618,Neurobehavioral and hemodynamic evaluation of Stroop and reverse Stroop interference in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,Akira Yasumura,"Failure of executive function (EF) is a core symptom of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, various results have been reported and sufficient evidence is lacking. In the present study, we evaluated the characteristics of children with ADHD using the Stroop task (ST) and reverse Stroop task (RST) that reflects the inhibition function of EF. We compared children with ADHD, typically developing children (TDC), and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is more difficult to discriminate from ADHD. A total of 10 children diagnosed with ADHD, 15 TDC, and 11 children diagnosed with ASD, all matched by age, sex, language ability, and intelligence quotient, participated in this study. While each subject performed computer-based ST and RST with a touch panel, changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) were measured in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to correlate test performance with neural activity. Behavioral performance significantly differed among 3 groups during RST but not during ST. The ADHD group showed greater color interference than the TDC group. In addition, there was a negative correlation between right lateral PFC (LPFC) activity and the severity of attention deficit. Children with ADHD exhibit several problems associated with inhibition of color, and this symptom is affected by low activities of the right LPFC. In addition, it is suggested that low hemodynamic activities in this area are correlated with ADHD."
23414525,A clinical study of the effects of lead poisoning on the intelligence and neurobehavioral abilities of children,Shuangxing Hou,"Background: Lead is a heavy metal and important environmental toxicant and nerve poison that can destruction many functions of the nervous system. Lead poisoning is a medical condition caused by increased levels of lead in the body. Lead interferes with a variety of body processes and is toxic to many organs and issues, including the central nervous system. It interferes with the development of the nervous system, and is therefore particularly toxic to children, causing potentially permanent neural and cognitive impairments. In this study, we investigated the relationship between lead poisoning and the intellectual and neurobehavioral capabilities of children. Methods: The background characteristics of the research subjects were collected by questionnaire survey. Blood lead levels were detected by differential potentiometric stripping analysis (DPSA). Intelligence was assessed using the Gesell Developmental Scale. The Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) was used to evaluate each child's behavior. Results: Blood lead levels were significantly negatively correlated with the developmental quotients of adaptive behavior, gross motor performance, fine motor performance, language development, and individual social behavior (P < 0.01). Compared with healthy children, more children with lead poisoning had abnormal behaviors, especially social withdrawal, depression, and atypical body movements, aggressions and destruction. Conclusion: Lead poisoning has adverse effects on the behavior and mental development of 2-4-year-old children, prescribing positive and effective precautionary measures."
23414440,"Cognitive, emotional and social markers of serial murdering",Alessandro Angrilli,"Although criminal psychopathy is starting to be relatively well described, our knowledge of the characteristics and scientific markers of serial murdering is still very poor. A serial killer who murdered more than five people, KT, was administered a battery of standardized tests aimed at measuring neuropsychological impairment and social/emotional cognition deficits. KT exhibited a striking dissociation between a high level of emotional detachment and a low score on the antisocial behavior scale on the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R). The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 showed a normal pattern with the psychotic triad at borderline level. KT had a high intelligence score and showed almost no impairment in cognitive tests sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Theory of Mind, Tower of London, this latter evidenced a mild impairment in planning performance). In the tests on moral, emotional and social cognition, his patterns of response differed from matched controls and from past reports on criminal psychopaths as, unlike these individuals, KT exhibited normal recognition of fear and a relatively intact knowledge of moral rules but he was impaired in the recognition of anger, embarrassment and conventional social rules. The overall picture of KT suggests that serial killing may be closer to normality than psychopathy defined according to either the DSM IV or the PCL-R, and it would be characterized by a relatively spared moral cognition and selective deficits in social and emotional cognition domains."
23413668,Quest for business intelligence in health care,Joe Van De Graaff,"In an era of reform, providers are examining more forward-thinking business intelligence strategies, according to a recent study. Enterprise business intelligence tool sets offer a breadth of design and functionality that often are capable of serving the enterprise. One limitation of broader tool sets is that they may lack needed application-specific functionality or prebuilt healthcare content for a specific department."
23411618,"High FSH decreases the developmental potential of mouse oocytes and resulting fertilized embryos, but does not influence offspring physiology and behavior in vitro or in vivo",Min Li,"Study question: Do different concentrations of FSH in the assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedure in vitro or in vivo affect the developmental competence of oocytes, the embryos and the offspring conceived from these embryos? Summary answer: Improper FSH treatment (200 IU/l in vitro, 10 IU/ml in vivo and 200 IU/ml in vivo) impairs the development competence of oocyte and embryo, but does not influence offspring physiology and behavior. What is known already: Exogenous FSH has been widely used in the field of ART. However, the effects of different concentrations of FSH on the developmental competence of oocytes, embryos and the offspring conceived from these embryos, are still unknown. Study design, size, duration: In a prospective study, a total of 45 mice at 8-10 weeks of age were primed in vivo with different dosages of FSH (9 mice in the 10 IU/ml, 10 mice in the 50 IU/ml, 10 mice in the 100 IU/ml and 16 mice in the 200 IU/ml groups). Fresh MII oocytes were retrieved from ovaries: this was designated as in vivo group. Thirty six mice at 8-10 weeks of age were sacrificed by cervical dislocation to obtain ovaries without FSH treatment (9 mice in the 0 IU/l, 9 mice in the 50 IU/l, 8 mice in the 100 IU/l and 10 mice in the 200 IU/l groups), and then the immature oocytes were collected from these ovaries and cultured in vitro matured medium supplemented with 0, 50, 100 and 200 IU/l FSH: this was designated as in vitro group. Materials, setting, methods: Spindle assembly of matured MII oocytes was stained via an immunofluorescence method and the oocytes ratio of normal spindle was analyzed. The developmental competence of the resulting fertilized embryos in the pre- and post-implantation stages was examined in in vitro and in vivo groups. Furthermore, physiological index, including reproductive potential and body weight, of the offspring was investigated by mating experiments and behavior index, including learning, memory, probing and intelligence, was tested by Morris water maze in in vitro and in vivo groups. Main results and the role of chance: In the in vitro groups, the oocyte maturation competence, normal spindle assembly, blastocyst formation and implantation, as well as viable pup production were all impaired in the group treated with 200 IU/l FSH (P < 0.05). No differences were observed among the other three groups (P > 0.05). In the in vivo groups, 10 IU/ml FSH but not 200 IU/ml treatment influenced blastocyst formation and viable pup production (P < 0.05), although the high proportion of spindle assembly abnormality was only observed in the 200 IU/ml FSH treatment group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in terms of physiological index (reproductive potential and body weight) and behavior index (learning, memory, probing and intelligence) in offspring from in vitro and in vivo groups (P > 0.05). Limitations, reasons for caution: The mouse model was used in this study. The results of the mouse follicle growth and oocyte development in responding to different concentrations of FSH are not 100% transferable to human, because of the physiological differences between mouse and human. Wider implications of the findings: The findings indicated that FSH application in the field of ART is safe to the resulted offspring, but it should be more carefully used for each women in ART cycles because the inappropriate FSH concentration would decrease the oocyte developmental competence. Study funding/competing interest(s): This work was partially supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China Grants (973 program; 2011CB944504), the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University of Ministry of Education of China (30825038), the National Natural Science Funds for Young Scholar (31000661) and by the Joint Research Fund for Overseas, Hong Kong and Marco Scholars (31128013/C120205).

23411126,An open clinical trial assessing a novel training program for social cognitive impairment in schizophrenia,Pamela Marsh,"Objective: Social cognition is profoundly impaired in patients with schizophrenia. This study describes 'Mental-State Reasoning Training for Social Cognitive Impairment' (SoCog-MSRT), a 5-week program developed to improve social cognition in patients with schizophrenia. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of implementing SoCog-MSRT in a rehabilitation setting and to evaluate whether our training methods produced improvements. METHOD The feasibility and benefits of SoCog-MSRT were evaluated in an open clinical trial with 14 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Training comprised 10 twice-weekly sessions, for 5 weeks, with a pre- and post-training assessment. Results: There were significant improvements on: (a) a classic false-belief test of Theory of Mind (ToM); (b) inferring complex mental states from the eyes; and (c) a self-reported measure of social understanding. Some of these improvements were associated with baseline levels of working memory and premorbid Intelligence Quotient (IQ). CONCLUSIONS SoCog-MSRT can improve ToM abilities and social understanding, but individuals with poorer working memory and lower premorbid IQ may be less able to benefit from this type of training."
23410598,Schizophrenia genetic variants are not associated with intelligence,A F Terwisscha van Scheltinga,"Background: Schizophrenia is associated with lower pre-morbid intelligence (IQ) in addition to (pre-morbid) cognitive decline. Both schizophrenia and IQ are highly heritable traits. Therefore, we hypothesized that genetic variants associated with schizophrenia, including copy number variants (CNVs) and a polygenic schizophrenia (risk) score (PSS), may influence intelligence. Method: IQ was estimated with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). CNVs were determined from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using the QuantiSNP and PennCNV algorithms. For the PSS, odds ratios for genome-wide SNP data were calculated in a sample collected by the Psychiatric Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) Consortium (8690 schizophrenia patients and 11 831 controls). These were used to calculate individual PSSs in our independent sample of 350 schizophrenia patients and 322 healthy controls. Results: Although significantly more genes were disrupted by deletions in schizophrenia patients compared to controls (p = 0.009), there was no effect of CNV measures on IQ. The PSS was associated with disease status (R 2 = 0.055, p = 2.1 × 10-7) and with IQ in the entire sample (R 2 = 0.018, p = 0.0008) but the effect on IQ disappeared after correction for disease status. Conclusions: Our data suggest that rare and common schizophrenia-associated variants do not explain the variation in IQ in healthy subjects or in schizophrenia patients. Thus, reductions in IQ in schizophrenia patients may be secondary to other processes related to schizophrenia risk."
23410240,Leadership training to improve nurse retention,Allan Wallis,"Aim: This paper discusses findings from an evaluation of a training programme designed to promote collaborative, team-based approaches to improve nurse retention within health care organizations. Background: A year-long leadership training programme was designed and implemented to develop effective teams that could address retention challenges in a diverse set of organizations in Colorado ranging from public, private to non-profit. Evaluation: An evaluation, based on a combination of participant observation, group interviews, and the use of standardized tests measuring individual emotional intelligence and team dynamics was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the training programme. Key issues: What role do the emotional intelligence of individual members and organizational culture play in team effectiveness? Conclusions: Out of five teams participating in the training programme, two performed exceptionally well, one experienced moderate success and two encountered significant problems. Team dynamics were significantly affected by the emotional intelligence of key members holding supervisory positions and by the existing culture and structure of the participating organizations. Implications for nursing management: Team approaches to retention hold promise but require careful development and are most likely to work where organizations have a collaborative problem-solving environment."
23410213,Correlations between motor and intellectual functions in normally developing children between 7 and 18 years,Oskar G Jenni,"The relationship between motor and intellectual functions was examined in 252 healthy children from 7 to 18 years using the Zurich Neuromotor Assessment and standardized intelligence tests. The magnitude of Spearman correlations between neuromotor and intellectual scores was generally weak (r = 0.15-0.37). The strongest correlations were found between performance in the pegboard task and visuomotor intelligence (r = 0.35) and between contralateral associated movements and intelligence in boys (r = 0.37). We conclude that specific connections between motor and intellectual functions may exist. However, because the magnitude of correlations is generally weak, we suggest that motor and intellectual domains in healthy children are largely independent."
23410008,Exploring leadership capability and emotional intelligence as moderators of workplace bullying,Marie Hutchinson,"Aim: This study aimed to explore the potential for emotionally intelligent leadership as a way to mitigate bullying behaviour within nursing workplace environments. Background: As the body of evidence about bullying continues to grow there is an increasing need for researchers to direct their attention to developing theoretical frameworks that explain how bullying and victimization occur, and the types of strategies that may address the problem. Evaluation: The narrative synthesis of the literature presented in this paper is forwarded as supporting the need for strengthening leadership capability, especially those capabilities associated with emotional intelligence, as a means of diminishing experienced bullying within nursing. Key issues: Stemming from our expanding understandings about bullying is an appreciation of the range of factors within organizations that influence the occurrence of bullying, and an awareness of the need to understand the expression, experience and management of emotions in the workplace. Conclusions: While both leadership and emotional intelligence capabilities offer real potential to mitigate bullying behaviour, disparity exits between clinical and managerial nurses toward preferred leadership styles and emotional intelligence is open to challenges towards its content validity. Implications for nursing management: Nursing management is challenged to build upon procedural responses to bullying to include a ground up approach to leadership enhancement capability, better responses to emotions in the workplace and supporting the interpersonal and intrapersonal capabilities of the nursing workforce."
23408267,Musical training intensity yields opposite effects on grey matter density in cognitive versus sensorimotor networks,Clara E James,"Using optimized voxel-based morphometry, we performed grey matter density analyses on 59 age-, sex- and intelligence-matched young adults with three distinct, progressive levels of musical training intensity or expertise. Structural brain adaptations in musicians have been repeatedly demonstrated in areas involved in auditory perception and motor skills. However, musical activities are not confined to auditory perception and motor performance, but are entangled with higher-order cognitive processes. In consequence, neuronal systems involved in such higher-order processing may also be shaped by experience-driven plasticity. We modelled expertise as a three-level regressor to study possible linear relationships of expertise with grey matter density. The key finding of this study resides in a functional dissimilarity between areas exhibiting increase versus decrease of grey matter as a function of musical expertise. Grey matter density increased with expertise in areas known for their involvement in higher-order cognitive processing: right fusiform gyrus (visual pattern recognition), right mid orbital gyrus (tonal sensitivity), left inferior frontal gyrus (syntactic processing, executive function, working memory), left intraparietal sulcus (visuo-motor coordination) and bilateral posterior cerebellar Crus II (executive function, working memory) and in auditory processing: left Heschl's gyrus. Conversely, grey matter density decreased with expertise in bilateral perirolandic and striatal areas that are related to sensorimotor function, possibly reflecting high automation of motor skills. Moreover, a multiple regression analysis evidenced that grey matter density in the right mid orbital area and the inferior frontal gyrus predicted accuracy in detecting fine-grained incongruities in tonal music."
23407275,Brain networks of social comparison,Gayannée Kedia,"Social comparison, that is, the process of comparing oneself to other people, is a ubiquitous social cognitive mechanism; however, so far its neural correlates have remained unknown. The present study tested the hypothesis that social comparisons are supported by partly dissociated networks, depending on whether the dimension under comparison concerns a physical or a psychological attribute. We measured brain activity with functional MRI, whereas participants were comparing their own height or intelligence to that of individuals they personally know. Height comparisons were associated with higher activity in a frontoparietal network involved in spatial and numerical cognition. Conversely, intelligence comparisons recruited a network of midline areas that have been previously implicated in the attribution of mental states to oneself and others (Theory of mind). These findings suggest that social comparisons rely on diverse domain-specific mechanisms rather than on one unitary process."
23407204,Mentalizing in female inpatients with major depressive disorder,Melitta Fischer-Kern,"Depression is associated with profound impairments in social and interpersonal functioning. However, little research has addressed deficits in mentalizing capacity that may underlie these impairments. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate the capacity for mentalization in female inpatients with depression in comparison with healthy controls. We assessed 46 inpatients with major depressive disorder with regard to psychiatric diagnoses, severity of depression, cognitive impairment, and verbal intelligence. In addition, 20 healthy controls matched for sex, age, and education were included. Mentalization was scored on the Adult Attachment Interview using the Reflective Functioning Scale. The female inpatients with depression showed a significantly lower capacity for mentalization compared with the healthy controls. Mentalization deficits were not restricted to depression-specific topics. Moreover, deficits in mentalizing capacity were related to illness duration, number of admissions, and cognitive impairment. The results indicate severe impairment in the ability of the female inpatients with depression to identify and interpret mental states of the self and others. Correlations with illness duration and number of admissions suggest that a chronic course of depression results in further mentalizing impairments. The investigation of mentalization may be of particular importance for the development of targeted psychotherapeutic interventions for depression."
23406546,The CACNA1C risk allele selectively impacts on executive function in bipolar type I disorder,M G Soeiro-de-Souza,"Objective: Calcium channels are important for converting electrical activity into biochemical events. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs1006737) in the CACNA1C gene has been strongly associated with increased risk for Bipolar disorder (BD) in genome-wide association studies. Recently, this same SNP has been reported to influence executive function in schizophrenia and controls, but it remains unclear whether this SNP affects behaviour, especially cognition in subjects with BD. Method: A total of 109 BD type I subjects and 96 controls were genotyped for CACNA1C rs1006737 and assessed with an executive function tests battery [Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III (WAIS-III) Letter-Number Sequence subtest (WAIS-LNS), digit span (WAISDS), trail making test (TMT), and WCST (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test)]. Results: In patients with BD, the CACNA1C genotype Met/Met was associated with worse performance on all four executive function tests compared to Val/Val. No influence of CACNA1C was observed in the cognitive performance of healthy controls. Conclusion: Our data indicate for the first time that the CACNA1C risk allele is likely associated with executive dysfunction as a trait in BD, as this association was found regardless the presence of mood symptoms. Larger studies should evaluate the potential influence of CACNA1C on other cognitive domains in BD."
23406482,Brain involvement in Alström syndrome,Valentina Citton,"Background: Alström Syndrome (AS) is a rare ciliopathy characterized by cone-rod retinal dystrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiomyopathy. Most patients do not present with neurological issues and demonstrate normal intelligence, although delayed psychomotor development and psychiatric disorders have been reported. To date, brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) abnormalities in AS have not been explored. Methods: We investigated structural brain changes in 12 genetically proven AS patients (mean-age 22 years; range: 6-45, 6 females) and 19 matched healthy and positive controls (mean-age 23 years; range: 6-43; 12 females) using conventional MRI, Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Results: 6/12 AS patients presented with brain abnormalities such as ventricular enlargement (4/12), periventricular white matter abnormalities (3/12) and lacune-like lesions (1/12); all patients older than 30 years had vascular-like lesions. VBM detected grey and white matter volume reduction in AS patients, especially in the posterior regions. DTI revealed significant fractional anisotropy decrease and radial diffusivity increase in the supratentorial white matter, also diffusely involving those regions that appeared normal on conventional imaging. On the contrary, axial and mean diffusivity did not differ from controls except in the fornix. Conclusions: Brain involvement in Alström syndrome is not uncommon. Early vascular-like lesions, gray and white matter atrophy, mostly involving the posterior regions, and diffuse supratentorial white matter derangement suggest a role of cilia in endothelial cell and oligodendrocyte function."
23406220,The role of abusive states of being in interrogation,Frank W Putnam,"Interrogation, the questioning of persons detained by police, military, or intelligence organizations, is designed to extract information that a subject may resist disclosing. Interrogation techniques are frequently predicated on inducing mental states of despair, dread, dependency, and debility that weaken an individual's resistance. Descriptions of techniques from 2 Central Intelligence Agency training manuals are illustrated by examples from interviews of and writings by Murat Kurnaz, who was held at Guantánamo Bay Detention Camp for 5 years. Interrogation techniques are designed to create a destabilizing sense of shock; undermine an individual's grasp on reality; and provoke internal psychological division, self-conflict, and confusion. The long-term effects of interrogation often include posttraumatic stress disorder as well as states of anxiety, depression, and depersonalization."
23406069,Bullying as workgroup manipulation: a model for understanding patterns of victimization and contagion within the workgroup,Marie Hutchinson,"Aim The aim of the present synthesis was to review the literature on bullying in the nursing workplace and develop an explanatory model for patterns of victimization and contagion within the workgroup. Background Although research has demonstrated that bullying can cause significant harm there has been little investigation or theorizing into the place of the workgroup as a vehicle for magnifying, transmitting or sustaining bullying. Evaluation Narrative synthesis of the literature on bullying in the nursing workplace. Key issues The putative model developed from a narrative synthesis of the available literature proposes four forms of bullying as workgroup manipulation. Conclusions The model provides insight into mechanisms for the contagion of bullying and victimization within workgroups and an explanatory mechanism for the way bullying can escalate to implicate patient care. Implications for Nurse Managers Recognizing workgroup manipulation processes and the patterns of victimization and contagion with the workgroup provides a deeper understanding of bullying and illustrates the place of intervention strategies which foster the emotional intelligence climate in nursing teams."

The beneficial effects of brain training games are expected to transfer to other cognitive functions. Yet in all honesty, beneficial transfer effects of the commercial brain training games in young adults have little scientific basis. Here we investigated the impact of the brain training game (Brain Age) on a wide range of cognitive functions in young adults. Methods: We conducted a double-blind (de facto masking) randomized controlled trial using a popular brain training game (Brain Age) and a popular puzzle game (Tetris). Thirty-two volunteers were recruited through an advertisement in the local newspaper and randomly assigned to either of two game groups (Brain Age, Tetris). Participants in both the Brain Age and the Tetris groups played their game for about 15 minutes per day, at least 5 days per week, for 4 weeks. Measures of the cognitive functions were conducted before and after training. Measures of the cognitive functions fell into eight categories (fluid intelligence, executive function, working memory, short-term memory, attention, processing speed, visual ability, and reading ability). Results and discussion: Our results showed that commercial brain training game improves executive functions, working memory, and processing speed in young adults. Moreover, the popular puzzle game can engender improvement attention and visuo-spatial ability compared to playing the brain training game. The present study showed the scientific evidence which the brain training game had the beneficial effects on cognitive functions (executive functions, working memory and processing speed) in the healthy young adults. Conclusions: Our results do not indicate that everyone should play brain training games. However, the commercial brain training game might be a simple and convenient means to improve some cognitive functions. We believe that our findings are highly relevant to applications in educational and clinical fields. Trial registration: UMIN Clinical Trial Registry 000005618."
23404798,Childhood intelligence and adult obesity,Satoshi Kanazawa,"Objective: Recent studies conclude childhood intelligence has no direct effect on adult obesity net of education, but evolutionary psychological theories suggest otherwise. Design and methods: A population (n = 17,419) of British babies has been followed since birth in 1958 in a prospectively longitudinal study. Childhood general intelligence is measured at 7, 11, and 16, and adult BMI and obesity are measured at 51. Results: Childhood general intelligence has a direct effect on adult BMI, obesity, and weight gain, net of education, earnings, mother's BMI, father's BMI, childhood social class, and sex. More intelligent children grow up to eat more healthy foods and exercise more frequently as adults. Conclusion: Childhood intelligence has a direct effect on adult obesity unmediated by education or earnings. General intelligence decreases BMI only in adulthood when individuals have complete control over what they eat."
23398552,Mothers' daily person and process praise: implications for children's theory of intelligence and motivation,Eva M Pomerantz,"This research examined if mothers' day-to-day praise of children's success in school plays a role in children's theory of intelligence and motivation. Participants were 120 children (mean age = 10.23 years) and their mothers who took part in a 2-wave study spanning 6 months. During the first wave, mothers completed a 10-day daily interview in which they reported on their use of person (e.g., ""You are smart"") and process (e.g., ""You tried hard"") praise. Children's entity theory of intelligence and preference for challenge in school were assessed with surveys at both waves. Mothers' person, but not process, praise was predictive of children's theory of intelligence and motivation: The more person praise mothers used, the more children subsequently held an entity theory of intelligence and avoided challenge over and above their earlier functioning on these dimensions."
23398524,Predictive value of neonatal brain MRI on the neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants by 5 years of age,Sirkku Setänen,"Aim: To study the prognostic value of MRI in preterm infants at term equivalent age for cognitive development at 5 years of age. Methods: A total of 217 very low birth weight/very low gestational age infants who all received brain MRI at term equivalent age were categorized into 4 groups based on the brain MRI findings. Cognitive development was assessed at 5 years of chronological age by using a short form of Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Revised. This information was combined with neurosensory diagnoses by 2 years of corrected age. Results: Of all infants 31 (17.0%) had Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) <85, 14 (6.5%) had cerebral palsy and 4 (1.8%) had severe hearing impairment. A total of 41 (22.0%) infants had some neurodevelopmental impairment at 5 years of age. Considering cognitive outcome (FSIQ <85), the positive predictive value of several major MRI pathologies was 43.8%, and the negative predictive value of normal finding or minor pathologies was 92.0% and 85.7%, respectively. Conclusion: The MRI of the brain at term equivalent age may be valuable in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants by 5 years of age. The findings should always be interpreted alongside the clinical information of the infant. Furthermore, MRI should not replace a long-term clinical follow-up for very preterm infants."
23398149,Investigating the structure of the WJ-III Cognitive at school age,Stefan C Dombrowski,"During its development, the Woodcock-Johnson, Third Edition Cognitive (WJ-III Cognitive; McGrew & Woodcock, 2001) was never subjected to structural analysis using exploratory and higher order factor analyses. Instead, confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on separate sets of WJ-III correlation matrices, yielding a seven-factor model across all age ranges. To see whether the structure holds for the WJ-III Cognitive, currently recognized best practice exploratory factor analysis (EFA) procedures were applied to two school-aged correlation matrices (ages 9-13; 14-19) from the normative sample. Using EFA and higher order factor analysis, four factors emerged at age 9 to 13 and three factors emerged at age 14 to 19. The results of this analysis indicated a robust manifestation of general intelligence (g) that exceeded the variance attributed to the lower order factors. An additional analysis was conducted that disregarded factor extraction rules and forced the seven-factor fit. The resulting solution was only partially aligned (i.e., Gc, Ga, and Gsm) with the theoretical structure posited in the WJ-III Technical Manual. Surprisingly, this study represents the first time to my knowledge that the WJ-III Cognitive has been subjected to EFA analyses given the instrument's significant use by practitioners and that it has served as the initial evidentiary base for Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory."
23398018,"Exploring the relationships among attachment, emotional intelligence and communication",M Gemma Cherry,"Objectives: Attachment style has been shown to influence both emotional intelligence (EI) and the clinical communication of medical students and doctors. No research has assessed the relationships among attachment, EI and clinical communication in medical students. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of EI on the relationship between medical students' attachment style and clinical communication. Methods: Medical students were invited to complete measures of attachment (using the Experiences in Close Relationships-Short Form [ECR-SF], a 12-item measure that provides attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety dimensional scores) and EI (using the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test [MSCEIT], a 141-item measure of the perception, use, understanding and management of emotions) at the end of Year 1, prior to a summative objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Clinical communication was assessed using OSCE scores. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to analyse a hypothetical model of the relationships among attachment style, EI and clinical communication. Results: A total of 200 of 358 (55.9%) students participated. Attachment avoidance was significantly negatively correlated with total EI scores (r=-0.28, p<0.01); total EI was significantly positively correlated with OSCE scores (r = 0.23, p < 0.01). A parsimonious SEM revealed that attachment avoidance accounted for 13% of the variance in students' total EI scores but did not directly predict OSCE scores, whereas total EI significantly predicted 7% of the variance in OSCE scores. Conclusions: Attachment is perceived to be stable from early adulthood, whereas the literature suggests that EI can be developed through the use of targeted interventions. This has potential implications for the training of medical students in clinical communication."
23397999,"Executive functions, depressive symptoms, and college adjustment in women",Jana Wingo,"Many students have difficulty adjusting to college, and the contribution of academic and relational factors have been considered in previous research. In particular, depression commonly emerges among college women at this time and could be related to poor adjustment to college. This study examined the relationship between executive functions, depressive symptoms, and college adjustment in college women. Seventy-seven female participants from a midsize urban university completed the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, College Adjustment Scale, Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version, and four subtests from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System: the Trail-Making Test, Design Fluency Test, Verbal Fluency Test, and Color-Word Interference Test. After controlling for IQ score, hierarchical regression analyses showed that subjective and objective measures of executive functioning and depressive symptoms were significantly related to college adjustment problems in academic, relational, and psychological areas. The current study provides evidence for a relationship between cognitive abilities, psychiatric symptoms, and college adjustment."
23397998,Factor structure of the Halstead-Reitan neuropsychological battery: a review and integration,Sylvia An Ross,"The Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Battery (HRNB) was the first factor-analyzed neuropsychological battery. It was based on a series of tests studied in Ward Halstead's laboratory at the University of Chicago, was accomplished in collaboration with a group of eminent statisticians, and was published in 1947 . Four factors were extracted based on Halstead's tests called central integrative field, abstraction, power, and directional and constituted what was described as biological intelligence. Since this original analysis, Reitan's additions to the battery, and the proposal of Reitan and Wolfson's model of neuropsychological functioning, this factor-analytic research continued. This article reviews factor-analytic research concluding that Halstead's analysis has held up reasonably well and there is support for the Reitan and Wolfson model. However, Reitan's revisions of the battery added tests that form a distinct language factor and the sensory-perceptual tests that generally form a separate factor. Other tests and scoring methods used in individual studies modified the core battery and produced somewhat differing solutions. The complexity of the tests prevents the HRNB from being a factorially pure battery, and simple structure is rarely, if ever, reached. Current versions of the HRNB appear to evaluate both ""biological"" and ""psychometric"" intelligence, which appear to load on separate factors."
23397994,WAIS-IV Digit Span variables: are they valuable for use in predicting TOMM and MSVT failure?,Kriscinda A Whitney,"The Digit Span (DS) task in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition differs substantially from earlier versions of the measure, with one of the major changes being the addition of a sequencing component. In the present investigation, the usefulness of the new sequencing task and other DS variables (i.e., DS Age-Scaled Score, DS Forward Total, DS Backward Total, and Reliable DS) was investigated with regard to the ability of these variables to predict negative response bias. Negative response bias was first defined and examined using below-cutoff performance on the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) (N = 99). Then, for comparison purposes, negative response bias was examined using below-cutoff performance on the Medical Symptom Validity Test (MSVT; N = 95). Study participants included primarily middle-aged outpatients at a Veterans Affairs medical center. Findings from this retrospective analysis showed that, regardless of whether the TOMM or the MSVT was used as the negative response bias criterion, of all the DS variables examined, DS Sequencing Total showed the best classification accuracy. Yet, due to its relatively low positive and negative predictive power, DS Sequencing Total is not recommended for use in isolation to identify negative response bias."
23397927,Long-term stability of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Fourth Edition,Marley W Watkins,"Long-term stability of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV; Wechsler, 2003) was investigated with a sample of 344 students from 2 school districts twice evaluated for special education eligibility at an average interval of 2.84 years. Test-retest reliability coefficients for the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI), Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI), Working Memory Index (WMI), Processing Speed Index (PSI), and the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) were .72, .76, .66, .65, and .82, respectively. As predicted, the test-retest reliability coefficients for the subtests (Mdn = .56) were generally lower than the index scores (Mdn = .69) and the FSIQ (.82). On average, subtest scores did not differ by more than 1 point, and index scores did not differ by more than 2 points across the test-retest interval. However, 25% of the students earned FSIQ scores that differed by 10 or more points, and 29%, 39%, 37%, and 44% of the students earned VCI, PRI, WMI, and PSI scores, respectively, that varied by 10 or more points. Given this variability, it cannot be assumed that WISC-IV scores will be consistent across long test-retest intervals for individual students."
23395328,Regular breakfast consumption is associated with increased IQ in kindergarten children,Jianghong Liu,"Background: Studies have documented a positive relationship between regular breakfast consumption and cognitive outcomes in youth. However, most of these studies have emphasized specific measures of cognition rather than cognitive performance as a broad construct (e.g., IQ test scores) and have been limited to Western samples of school-age children and adolescents. This study aims to extend the literature on breakfast consumption and cognition by examining these constructs in a sample of Chinese kindergarten-age children. Methods: This cross-sectional study consisted of a sample of 1269 children (697 boys and 572 girls) aged 6 years from the Chinese city of Jintan. Cognition was assessed with the Chinese version of the Wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence-revised. Breakfast habits were assessed through parental questionnaire. Analyses of variance and linear regression models were used to analyze the association between breakfast habits and IQ. Socioeconomic and parental psychosocial variables related to intelligence were controlled for. Results: Findings showed that children who regularly have breakfast on a near-daily basis had significantly higher full scale, verbal, and performance IQ test scores (all p<0.001) compared to children who ""sometimes"" have breakfast. This relationship persisted for VIQ (verbal IQ) and FIQ (full IQ) even after adjusting for gender, current living location, parental education, parental occupation, and primary child caregiver. Conclusion: Findings may reflect nutritional as well as social benefits of regular breakfast consumption on cognition, and regular breakfast consumption should be encouraged among young children."
23392844,Architecture of fluid intelligence and working memory revealed by lesion mapping,Aron K Barbey,"Although cognitive neuroscience has made valuable progress in understanding the role of the prefrontal cortex in human intelligence, the functional networks that support adaptive behavior and novel problem solving remain to be well characterized. Here, we studied 158 human brain lesion patients to investigate the cognitive and neural foundations of key competencies for fluid intelligence and working memory. We administered a battery of neuropsychological tests, including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the N-Back task. Latent variable modeling was applied to obtain error-free scores of fluid intelligence and working memory, followed by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to elucidate their neural substrates. The observed latent variable modeling and lesion results support an integrative framework for understanding the architecture of fluid intelligence and working memory and make specific recommendations for the interpretation and application of the WAIS and N-Back task to the study of fluid intelligence in health and disease."
23392179,Neuropsychological detection of the early stage of amnestic mild cognitive impairment without objective memory impairment,Norio Murayama,"Aim: We investigate the assessment method to detect the early stage of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) using Wechsler Memory Scale - Revised (WMS-R) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Third Edition (WAIS-III). Methods: Three groups (normal group, aMCI group, and early aMCI group), controlled for age and years of education, underwent brain (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET), WAIS-III, WMS-R, and other tests. The early aMCI group does not fulfill the clinical diagnostic criteria of aMCI because patients do not have objective memory impairment, but their clinical symptoms and results of (18)F-FDG PET indicate that they should be included in the category of aMCI. Results: The discrepancy of scores between Verbal IQ and General Memory had the highest accuracy in discriminating between normal and early aMCI groups. Conclusion: The cutoff point determined in this study is useful to detect an early stage of aMCI, which may be distinguished from aMCI using the current criteria."
23391504,Predictors of neuropsychological change in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome,Mary-Ellen Meadows,"This study examined the course of neuropsychological functioning in patients with chronic myelogeous leukemia (n = 91) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 15) who underwent standard treatment for their disease or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at baseline, 12 months, and 18 months post-treatment. At baseline, 23% of the participants (n = 75) in the longitudinal sample had Z-scores on at least one of the neuropsychological tests that were <1.4. Participants in the study showed improvement over baseline at the 12 and 18 months assessments. The average Z-scores for the six cognitive domains in the longitudinal data set over the course of the study ranged from -0.89 to 0.59. Significant predictors of change in neuropsychological test scores included age, with older participants showing less improvement over time. Other predictors included baseline cognitive domains (language, memory, and attention), previous cocaine use, disease status, intelligence quotient, and quality of life measures. Findings support previous studies in patients with hematological malignancies who showed cognitive impairments at baseline prior to HSCT. However, there was little evidence for further cognitive decline over the course of 18 months."
23390528,"Topological organization of functional brain networks in healthy children: differences in relation to age, sex, and intelligence",Kai Wu,"Recent studies have demonstrated developmental changes of functional brain networks derived from functional connectivity using graph theoretical analysis, which has been rapidly translated to studies of brain network organization. However, little is known about sex- and IQ-related differences in the topological organization of functional brain networks during development. In this study, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) was used to map the functional brain networks in 51 healthy children. We then investigated the effects of age, sex, and IQ on economic small-world properties and regional nodal properties of the functional brain networks. At a global level of whole networks, we found significant age-related increases in the small-worldness and local efficiency, significant higher values of the global efficiency in boys compared with girls, and no significant IQ-related difference. Age-related increases in the regional nodal properties were found predominately in the frontal brain regions, whereas the parietal, temporal, and occipital brain regions showed age-related decreases. Significant sex-related differences in the regional nodal properties were found in various brain regions, primarily related to the default mode, language, and vision systems. Positive correlations between IQ and the regional nodal properties were found in several brain regions related to the attention system, whereas negative correlations were found in various brain regions primarily involved in the default mode, emotion, and language systems. Together, our findings of the network topology of the functional brain networks in healthy children and its relationship with age, sex, and IQ bring new insights into the understanding of brain maturation and cognitive development during childhood and adolescence."
23390191,Serum folate but not vitamin B-12 concentrations are positively associated with cognitive test scores in children aged 6-16 years,Cathy T Nguyen,"Folate and vitamin B-12 are important for nervous system functioning at all ages, with important roles in functions such as neurotransmitter synthesis. Although studies suggest a relation between folate and vitamin B-12 and cognitive function in the elderly population, there is relatively less evidence regarding these vitamins and children's cognitive function. The purpose of the study was to examine the associations of serum folate and vitamin B-12 with cognitive performance in children 6-16 y old in the NHANES III, conducted from 1988 to 1994, prior to the implementation of folic acid fortification. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data on 5365 children 6-16 y old from NHANES III. Serum folate and vitamin B-12 concentrations were measured, along with performance, on the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised. Associations of B vitamins with cognitive performance were assessed using linear regression models adjusted for various covariates. Higher serum concentrations of folate were associated with higher reading and block design scores after adjusting for various covariates. For example, compared with the lowest quartile of folate, children in the highest quartile scored 3.28 points or 0.19 SD units higher on the reading test (P < 0.05). Vitamin B-12 was not associated with any of the test scores. In the largest study to date, higher folate concentrations were associated with better reading and block design scores. These associations appear to be biologically plausible and merit further study."
23390136,Homozygous and heterozygous disruptions of ANK3: at the crossroads of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders,Zafar Iqbal,"AnkyrinG, encoded by the ANK3 gene, is involved in neuronal development and signaling. It has previously been implicated in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia by association studies. Most recently, de novo missense mutations in this gene were identified in autistic patients. However, the causative nature of these mutations remained controversial. Here, we report inactivating mutations in the Ankyrin 3 (ANK3) gene in patients with severe cognitive deficits. In a patient with a borderline intelligence, severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism and sleeping problems, all isoforms of the ANK3 gene, were disrupted by a balanced translocation. Furthermore, in a consanguineous family with moderate intellectual disability (ID), an ADHD-like phenotype and behavioral problems, we identified a homozygous truncating frameshift mutation in the longest isoform of the same gene, which represents the first reported familial mutation in the ANK3 gene. The causality of ANK3 mutations in the two families and the role of the gene in cognitive function were supported by memory defects in a Drosophila knockdown model. Thus we demonstrated that ANK3 plays a role in intellectual functioning. In addition, our findings support the suggested association of ANK3 with various neuropsychiatric disorders and illustrate the genetic and molecular relation between a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders."
23388581,Associations of maternal weight gain in pregnancy with offspring cognition in childhood and adolescence: findings from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children,Suzanne H Gage,"An association of gestational weight gain (GWG) with offspring cognition has been postulated. We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a United Kingdom prospective cohort (1990 through the present) with a median of 10 maternal weight measurements in pregnancy. These were used to allocate participants to 2009 Institute of Medicine weight-gain categories and in random effect linear spline models. Outcomes were School Entry Assessment score (age, 4 years; n = 5,832), standardized intelligence quotient assessed by Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (age, 8 years; n = 5,191), and school final-examination results (age, 16 years; n = 7,339). Offspring of women who gained less weight than recommended had a 0.075 standard deviation lower mean School Entry Assessment score (95% confidence interval: -0.127, -0.023) and were less likely to achieve adequate final-examination results (odds ratio = 0.88, 95% confidence interval: 0.78, 0.99) compared with offspring of women who gained as recommended. GWG in early pregnancy (defined as 0-18 weeks on the basis of a knot point at 18 weeks) and midpregnancy (defined as 18-28 weeks on the basis of knot points at 18 and 28 weeks) was positively associated with School Entry Assessment score and intelligence quotient. GWG in late pregnancy (defined as 28 weeks onward on the basis of a knot point at 28 weeks) was positively associated with offspring intelligence quotient and with increased odds of offspring achieving adequate final-examination results in mothers who were overweight prepregnancy. Findings support small positive associations between GWG and offspring cognitive development, which may have lasting effects on educational attainment up to age 16 years."
23387365,"Apolipoprotein E, brain injury and neurodevelopmental outcome of children",M Korja,"Apolipoprotein E plays an important role in neurodegenerative processes in adulthood, whereas its neurodevelopmental role is uncertain. We aimed to study the effect of apolipoprotein E on neurodevelopment in a cohort liable to neurodevelopmental changes. The cohort consisted of very preterm (<32 gestational weeks) and/or very low birth weight (<1500 g) children, and the longitudinal follow-up protocol included sequential cranial ultrasounds during infancy, brain magnetic resonance imaging at term-equivalent age, neurological and cognitive assessment (Mental Developmental Index) at the corrected age of 2 years and cognitive and neuropsychological assessments (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence and Developmental NEuroPSYchological Assessment) at the chronological age of 5 years. Apolipoprotein E genotypes were determined from 322 children. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging data were available for 321 (99.7%) and 151 (46.9%) children, respectively. Neurodevelopmental assessment data were available for 138 (42.9%) to 171 (53.1%) children. Abnormal findings in ultrasounds and magnetic resonance imaging were found in 163 (50.8%) and 64 (42.4%) children, respectively. Mild cognitive delay at the corrected age of 2 years and the chronological age of 5 years was suspected in 21 (12.3%) of 171 and 19 (13.8%) of 138 children, respectively. In the Developmental NEuroPSYchological Assessment, 47 (32.6%) of 144 children had significantly impaired performances in more than one study subtest. No associations between the apolipoprotein E genotypes and imaging findings or measured neurodevelopmental variables were found. Apolipoprotein E genotypes do not appear to have major impact on brain vulnerability or neurodevelopment in children."
23386788,General versus executive cognitive ability in pupils with ADHD and with milder attention problems,Ulla Ek,"Background: The aim of this study was to analyze two main types of cognitive domains in school children with different types and severities of attention-related problems. The cognitive domains examined were general cognitive ability and executive abilities. Methods: Three different clinical samples of pupils with school problems were analyzed to assess their cognitive Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children profiles. In particular, the general cognitive ability index and the executive markers (ie, verbal memory index and processing speed index) were of interest. Of the total sample (n = 198), two main groups were contrasted; one met the full criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)/subthreshold ADHD, and one was comprised of those with milder attention problems, insufficient to meet the criteria for ADHD/subthreshold ADHD. Results: It could be demonstrated that both groups had a significantly higher score on the general cognitive ability index than on measures of working memory and processing speed. This difference was more pronounced for boys. Conclusion: These types of cognitive differences need to be considered in children with different kinds of learning, behavior, and attention problems; this is also true for children presenting with an average general intelligence quotient and with milder attention problems. Current educational expectations are demanding for children with mild difficulties, and such cognitive information will add to the understanding of the child's learning problems, hopefully leading to a better adapted education than that conventionally available."
23386252,Prognostic study of sevoflurane-based general anesthesia on cognitive function in children,Qing Fan,"Purpose: It is unclear whether volatile general anesthetics have sustained adverse effects on the immature brains of children. We performed a self-controlled study to evaluate the effects of strabismus surgery under sevoflurane-based general anesthesia on the cognitive function of pediatric patients. Methods: The study included 100 children of ages 4 to 7 years old scheduled to undergo strabismus correction under sevoflurane-based general anesthesia. Cognitive function was tested 1 day before the operation (T1), 1 month after the operation (T2), and 6 months after the operation by the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) (Third Edition) method, which consists of 150 items. The scores at T1 were compared with scores at T2 and T3. Results: Seventy-two children completed the three tests. At T1, they were 66.1 ± 7.7 months old and had a mean body weight of 21.6 ± 4.0 kg. The mean anesthesia time was 67.3 ± 9.8 min. The mean interval between T1 and T2 was 25.4 ± 6.8 days, and that between T1 and T3 was 182.1 ± 27.7 days. No statistically significant decrease in WPPSI scores was observed between T1 and T2, or between T1 and T3. Conclusion: These findings from our self-controlled study show that sevoflurane-based general anesthesia does not have significantly adverse effects on the cognitive function of 4- to 7-year-old children at 1 month and 6 months after strabismus surgery. Additional studies with a larger sample size are needed."
23384877,Borderline intellectual functioning: consensus and good practice guidelines,Luis Salvador-Carulla,"Introduction: The Borderline Intellectual Functioning (BIF) is conceptualized as the frontier that delimits ""normal"" intellectual functioning from intellectual disability (IQ 71-85). In spite of its magnitude, its prevalence cannot be quantified and its diagnosis has not yet been defined. Objectives: To elaborate a conceptual framework and to establish consensus guidelines. Method: A mixed qualitative methodology, including frame analysis and nominal groups techniques, was used. The literature was extensively reviewed in evidence based medical databases, scientific publications, and the grey literature. This information was studied and a framing document was prepared. Results: Scientific publications covering BIF are scarce. The term that yields a bigger number of results is ""Borderline Intelligence"". The Working Group detected a number of areas in which consensus was needed and wrote a consensus document covering the conclusions of the experts and the framing document. Conclusions: It is a priority to reach an international consensus about the BIF construct and its operative criteria, as well as to develop specific tools for screening and diagnosis. It is also necessary to define criteria that enable its incidence and prevalence. To know what interventions are the most efficient, and what are the needs of this population, is vital to implement an integral model of care centred on the individual."
23384737,Assessment of real-world daily-living skills in early-onset schizophrenia trough the Life Skills Profile scale,O Puig,"Background: Adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) have marked deficits in their functional outcome. However, few short and reliable instruments for assessing real-world functioning have been specifically validated in EOS. The Life Skills Profile (LSP) is a brief scale widely used in schizophrenia and considered one of the optimal instruments for assessing real-world daily living skills. The purpose of this study was to examine the usefulness and the feasibility of the LSP to assess daily living skills in EOS. Methods: The sample included 53 clinically and pharmacologically stabilized adolescent patients with EOS and 53 healthy adolescents. Content review of the scale and internal consistency analysis were conducted in the EOS group. A subgroup of 30 patients was re-assessed over a 10-day interval to establish the test-retest reliability. Measures of functional outcome were used to assess convergent validity, and measures of intelligence and symptoms were used to assess divergent validity. Discriminant validity was analyzed through logistic analysis and the receiver-operating characteristic curve. Results: The LSP and its subscales showed high reliability, adequate internal consistency and adequate convergent and divergent validity. The LSP was also found to be a sensitive instrument for detecting differences between patients and healthy adolescents, correctly classifying 84% of the sample. The estimated area under the curve was 0.925 (95% CI 0.875-0.976). Conclusions: The LSP showed adequate psychometric characteristics in adolescents with EOS and appeared to be a valid, reliable and time-efficient instrument for use in clinical practice and research settings to assess real-world daily-living skills in EOS."
23384475,Understanding and fighting the medicine counterfeit market,Klara Dégardin,"Medicine counterfeiting is a serious worldwide issue, involving networks of manufacture and distribution that are an integral part of industrialized organized crime. Despite the potentially devastating health repercussions involved, legal sanctions are often inappropriate or simply not applied. The difficulty in agreeing on a definition of counterfeiting, the huge profits made by the counterfeiters and the complexity of the market are the other main reasons for the extent of the phenomenon. Above all, international cooperation is needed to thwart the spread of counterfeiting. Moreover effort is urgently required on the legal, enforcement and scientific levels. Pharmaceutical companies and agencies have developed measures to protect the medicines and allow fast and reliable analysis of the suspect products. Several means, essentially based on chromatography and spectroscopy, are now at the disposal of the analysts to enable the distinction between genuine and counterfeit products. However the determination of the components and the use of analytical data for forensic purposes still constitute a challenge. The aim of this review article is therefore to point out the intricacy of medicine counterfeiting so that a better understanding can provide solutions to fight more efficiently against it."
23383111,No effect of genome-wide copy number variation on measures of intelligence in a New Zealand birth cohort,Andrew T M Bagshaw,"Variation in human intelligence is approximately 50% heritable, but understanding of the genes involved is limited. Several forms of genetic variation remain under-studied in relation to intelligence, one of which is copy number variation (CNV). Using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -based microarrays, we genotyped CNVs genome-wide in a birth cohort of 723 New Zealanders, and correlated them with four intelligence-related phenotypes. We found no significant association for any common CNV after false discovery correction, which is consistent with previous work. In contrast to a previous study, however, we found no effect on any cognitive measure of rare CNV burden, defined as total number of bases inserted or deleted in CNVs rarer than 5%. We discuss possible reasons for this failure to replicate, including interaction between CNV and aging in determining the effects of rare CNVs. While our results suggest that no CNV assayable by SNP chips contributes more than a very small amount to variation in human intelligence, it remains possible that common CNVs in segmental duplication arrays, which are not well covered by SNP chips, are important contributors."
23382934,Adolescents' functional numeracy is predicted by their school entry number system knowledge,David C Geary,"One in five adults in the United States is functionally innumerate; they do not possess the mathematical competencies needed for many modern jobs. We administered functional numeracy measures used in studies of young adults' employability and wages to 180 thirteen-year-olds. The adolescents began the study in kindergarten and participated in multiple assessments of intelligence, working memory, mathematical cognition, achievement, and in-class attentive behavior. Their number system knowledge at the beginning of first grade was defined by measures that assessed knowledge of the systematic relations among Arabic numerals and skill at using this knowledge to solve arithmetic problems. Early number system knowledge predicted functional numeracy more than six years later (ß = 0.195, p = .0014) controlling for intelligence, working memory, in-class attentive behavior, mathematical achievement, demographic and other factors, but skill at using counting procedures to solve arithmetic problems did not. In all, we identified specific beginning of schooling numerical knowledge that contributes to individual differences in adolescents' functional numeracy and demonstrated that performance on mathematical achievement tests underestimates the importance of this early knowledge."
23381484,Brief report: is cognitive rehabilitation needed in verbal adults with autism? Insights from initial enrollment in a trial of cognitive enhancement therapy,Shaun M Eack,"Cognitive rehabilitation is an emerging set of potentially effective interventions for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder, yet the applicability of these approaches for ""high functioning"" adults who have normative levels of intelligence remains unexplored. This study examined the initial cognitive performance characteristics of 40 verbal adults with autism enrolled in a pilot trial of Cognitive Enhancement Therapy to investigate the need for cognitive rehabilitation in this population. Results revealed marked and broad deficits across neurocognitive and social-cognitive domains, despite above-average IQ. Areas of greatest impairment included processing speed, cognitive flexibility, and emotion perception and management. These findings indicate the need for comprehensive interventions designed to enhance cognition among verbal adults with autism who have intact intellectual functioning."
23381483,Practice makes improvement: how adults with autism out-perform others in a naturalistic visual search task,Cleotilde Gonzalez,"People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often exhibit superior performance in visual search compared to others. However, most studies demonstrating this advantage have employed simple, uncluttered images with fully visible targets. We compare the performance of high-functioning adults with ASD and matched controls on a naturalistic luggage screening task. Although the two groups were equally accurate in detecting targets, the ASD adults improve in their correct elimination of target-absent bags faster than controls. This feature of their behavior is extremely important for many real-world monitoring tasks that require sustained attention for long time periods. Further analyses suggest that this improvement is attributable neither to the motor speed nor to the level of intelligence of the adults with ASD. These findings may have possible implications for employment opportunities of adult individuals with ASD."
23380810,Math anxiety differentially affects WAIS-IV arithmetic performance in undergraduates,Melissa T Buelow,"Previous research has shown that math anxiety can influence the math performance level; however, to date, it is unknown whether math anxiety influences performance on working memory tasks during neuropsychological evaluation. In the present study, 172 undergraduate students completed measures of math achievement (the Math Computation subtest from the Wide Range Achievement Test-IV), math anxiety (the Math Anxiety Rating Scale-Revised), general test anxiety (from the Adult Manifest Anxiety Scale-College version), and the three Working Memory Index tasks from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV Edition (WAIS-IV; Digit Span [DS], Arithmetic, Letter-Number Sequencing [LNS]). Results indicated that math anxiety predicted performance on Arithmetic, but not DS or LNS, above and beyond the effects of gender, general test anxiety, and math performance level. Our findings suggest that math anxiety can negatively influence WAIS-IV working memory subtest scores. Implications for clinical practice include the utilization of LNS in individuals expressing high math anxiety."
23380064,Automated shape annotation for illicit tablet preparations: a contour angle based classification from digital images,Martin Lopatka,"In order to facilitate forensic intelligence efforts in managing large collections of physical feature data pertaining to illicit tablets, we have developed an automated shape classification method. This approach performs categorical shape annotation for the domain of illicit tablets. It is invariant to scale, rotation and translation and operates on digital images of seized tablets. The approach employs two processing levels. The first (coarse) level is being based on comparing the contour curvature space of tablet pairs. The second (fine) level is a rule based approach, implemented as a classification tree, that exploits characteristic similarities of shape categories. Annotation is demonstrated over a collection of 169 tablets selected for their diverse shapes with an accuracy of 97.6% when 19 shape categories are defined."
23379982,The use of forensic case data in intelligence-led policing: the example of drug profiling,Marie Morelato,"To date, forensic science has predominantly focused on generating evidence for judicial proceedings. While many recognise its broader and important contribution to the initial stages of the forensic process, resources do not seem to be employed efficiently. It is often discovered retrospectively that necessary information was previously available in a database or within existing files. Such information could have been proactively used in order to solve a particular case, a number of linked cases or better understand the criminal activity as a whole. This article reviews this broader contribution of forensic science, with a particular emphasis on drug intelligence at the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in Australia. Using the AFP as a model organisation, an overview of the current situation and the contribution of physical and chemical profiling are first discussed. The situation in Europe, and in particular in Switzerland, is also presented. It is argued that a change of attitude towards a more intelligence-led perspective is required in forensic science in general, and in drug profiling in particular."
23378221,The adult seizure and social outcomes of children with partial complex seizures,Carol S Camfield,"Most intellectually normal children with focal epilepsy have partial complex or focal with secondary generalization seizures without a precise epilepsy syndrome. Their long-term outcome is largely unknown. Cases were identified from the population-based Nova Scotia Childhood Epilepsy cohort. Those eligible had seizure onset at 1 month to 16 years between 1977 and 1985, normal intelligence, ≥10 years of follow-up, only focal seizures and no benign epilepsy syndromes. There were 108 patients with partial complex with or without secondary generalization as the only seizure type(s) throughout (partial complex group) and 80 with secondary generalization as the only seizure type (secondary generalization group). Average age ± standard deviation at onset was 7.3 ± 4.5 years and follow-up was 27.9 ± 5.4 years. At follow-up, 57% of the partial complex group were in remission versus 81% of the secondary generalization group (P = 0.001). The partial complex group was more likely to be intractable or have undergone epilepsy surgery (36% versus 5%, P = 0.000). In the partial complex group, 28% had <5 years seizure free versus 5% in the secondary generalized group (P = 0.000). More patients in the partial complex group had undergone mental health assessments (59% versus 32%, P = 0.000), and 33% had a psychiatric diagnosis versus 15% in the secondary generalized group (P = 0.004). More patients with partial complex seizures had specific learning disorders (63% versus 45%, P = 0.03). Seven markers of poor social outcome were more common in patients with partial complex seizures (>2 markers: 34% versus 10%, P = 0.000). During 25-30 years of follow-up, >50% of intellectually normal patients with childhood-onset partial complex seizures had difficult-to-control seizures and learning and psychiatric/social problems. Most with secondary generalized seizures only had remission and better academic and psychiatric/social outcomes."
23374064,Maternal hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and mild cognitive limitations in the offspring,Ulla Heikura,"Background: It remains unclear whether maternal hypertensive disorders could impact cognitive development of the child. The aim of this study was to explore the association between hypertensive disorders and other maternal biological and social factors on the risk of mild cognitive limitations (intelligence quotient 50-85) in the offspring. Methods: An 11.5-year follow-up study of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (n = 9432) was utilised. The analysis included 8847 singleton children, of whom 198 had mild cognitive limitations. Gestational hypertension was defined as de novo hypertension (blood pressure ≥ 140/90), diagnosed mid-pregnancy in a previously normotensive woman. Data on intelligence level of the children were based on standardised intelligence test results. Results: Eleven per cent (n = 20) of mothers having a child with mild cognitive limitations had gestational hypertension. Maternal gestational hypertension was independently associated with increased odds of mild cognitive limitation in the offspring (odds ratio 2.4 [95% confidence interval 1.4, 3.9]). Other independent maternal risk factors for mild cognitive limitation were high pre-pregnancy body mass index (≥30 kg/m(2)), multiparity (≥4) and low education. In addition family's socio-economic status lower than professional, male gender and small birthweight-for-gestational age appeared as independent risk factors for mild cognitive limitation. Conclusions: Gestational hypertension should be considered as one of the adverse early risk factors that may predispose to impaired cognitive development in childhood."
23373683,Structural validity of the Dutch-language version of the WAIS-III in a psychiatric sample,Paul van der Heijden,"The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV; Wechsler, 2008 ) no longer provides the ""traditional"" Verbal IQ and Performance IQ deviation scores. In the current study, we investigated the structural validity of these scores in the scale's predecessor, the WAIS-Third Edition (WAIS-III; Wechsler, 1997c ), which is still widely used in clinical practice, especially outside the United States. Confirmative (CFA) and exploratory factor analyses (EFA) were performed on WAIS-III data from a Dutch sample of 247 psychiatric patients. Four competing models were tested in the CFA on 11 subtests. The model that fit the data best was a model in which subtests loaded on the four factor indexes (i.e., 3 Verbal Comprehension subtests, 3 Perceptual Organization subtests, 3 Working Memory subtests, and 2 Processing Speed subtests) as proposed by the manual (Wechsler, 1997b ). In the EFA on 13 subtests with four factors extracted, all subtests were found to load on the factors in accordance with the WAIS-III test manual. However, Picture Arrangement, Arithmetic, and Picture Completion showed only moderate loadings on the proposed factors. Implications for clinical practice are discussed."
23373679,Exploration of the Raven APM-National Adult Reading Test discrepancy as a measure of intellectual decline in older persons,Esther van den Berg,"Previous studies have shown that the discrepancy between performance on ""fluid"" and ""crystallized"" intelligence measures may serve as an indicator for intellectual decline. The validity of this procedure in older persons is unknown. The present study developed a multiple regression equation, to predict the Raven Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) score from the National Adult Reading Test (NART) score and demographic variables in a large sample of healthy older persons (n = 270). The discrepancy between the predicted and observed Raven APM scores was transformed into a percentile distribution as an indicator of intellectual decline, which can be used in clinical practice. The validity of the procedure was further examined by comparing the proportion of persons with a significant decline (at the -1 and -1.65 SD level) between two older patient samples (87 patients with cerebral stroke and 387 patients with diabetes mellitus) by means of χ(2) tests. There was a significantly higher rate of intellectual decline at the -1 SD (""below average"") and -1.65 SD (""impaired"") cutoff levels for patients with stroke compared with patients with diabetes (stroke, 34% and 14%; diabetes, 16% and 5%, p < .05). These findings suggest that the Raven APM-NART discrepancy may be a useful measure of intellectual decline in older persons."
23372271,Sleep spindle activity and cognitive performance in healthy children,Alex Chatburn,"Study objectives: To investigate the association between indices of sleep spindle activity and cognitive performance in a sample of healthy children. Design: Correlational. Intelligence (Stanford-Binet) and neurocognitive functioning (NEPSY) were assessed, with sleep variables being measured during overnight polysomnography. Setting: Hospital sleep laboratory. Participants: Twenty-seven healthy children (mean age 8.19 y; 14 female, 13 male). Interventions: N/A. Measurements and results: Participants underwent a single night of overnight polysomnography after completing measures of intelligence and neurocognitive functioning. Sleep spindles were visually identified by an experienced sleep scoring technician and separated algorithmically into fast (> 13 Hz) and slow spindle (< 13 Hz) categories. The number of fast spindles was significantly correlated with narrative memory (r(s) = 0.38) and sensorimotor functioning (-0.43). Mean central frequency of spindles was also significantly correlated with sensorimotor functioning (-0.41), planning ability (-0.41), and working memory (-0.54). Conclusions: Basal sleep spindle activity is associated with different aspects of cognitive performance in children. To the extent that these associations in a pediatric population are different from what is known in adult sleep may play an important role in development."
23372013,Emergent sensing of complex environments by mobile animal groups,Andrew Berdahl,"The capacity for groups to exhibit collective intelligence is an often-cited advantage of group living. Previous studies have shown that social organisms frequently benefit from pooling imperfect individual estimates. However, in principle, collective intelligence may also emerge from interactions between individuals, rather than from the enhancement of personal estimates. Here, we reveal that this emergent problem solving is the predominant mechanism by which a mobile animal group responds to complex environmental gradients. Robust collective sensing arises at the group level from individuals modulating their speed in response to local, scalar, measurements of light and through social interaction with others. This distributed sensing requires only rudimentary cognition and thus could be widespread across biological taxa, in addition to being appropriate and cost-effective for robotic agents."
23371512,"Ethics in actor networks, or: what Latour could learn from Darwin and Dewey",Katinka Waelbers,"In contemporary Science, Technology and Society (STS) studies, Bruno Latour's Actor Network Theory (ANT) is often used to study how social change arises from interaction between people and technologies. Though Latour's approach is rich in the sense of enabling scholars to appreciate the complexity of many relevant technological, environmental, and social factors in their studies, the approach is poor from an ethical point of view: the doings of things and people are couched in one and the same behaviorist (third person) vocabulary without giving due recognition to the ethical relevance of human intelligence, sympathy and reflection in making responsible choices. This article argues that two other naturalist projects, the non-teleological virtue ethics of Charles Darwin and the pragmatist instrumentalism of John Dewey can enrich ANT-based STS studies, both, in a descriptive and in a normative sense."
23371369,Hippocampal volume reduction in elderly patients at risk for postoperative cognitive dysfunction,Ming-hua Chen,"Purpose: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is a formidable public health issue, which would not only affect the quality of life among elderly patients but also lead to pulmonary infection and increased mortality. While, there is a lack of an effective indicator in predicting POCD. As one pivotal part of the limbic system in brain, hippocampus is associated with cognitive function. Hippocampal atrophy could indicate the degree of changes in cognitive function. Methods: Forty-one ASA II or III patients (23 male, 18 female) aged ≥65 years undergoing open gastrointestinal tract surgery were enrolled in this study. MRI was performed to measure the volume of hippocampal formation before surgery and the results were standardized according to individual intracranial volume. All patients underwent a battery of neuropsychological tests including sensitive tests on the Wechsler adult memory scale and Wechsler adult intelligence scale, trail making test and the grooved pegboard test. We used the Z score to identify POCD as recommended by ISPOCD. All patients were then divided into POCD group and non-POCD group according to the results of the neuropsychological tests. The results of the tests were correlated with the volume of hippocampal formation measured by MRI. The value of MRI measurement of hippocampal volume in predicting POCD was analyzed. Multivariate linear correlation analyses of compositive Z score using potential contributing factors such as age, duration of anesthesia, education and hippocampal volume was carried out. Results: Thirty-six patients completed the whole battery of neuropsychological tests after surgery. Thirteen of the 36 patients were found to have POCD (36 %) on the postoperative 4th day. The hippocampal volume was significantly smaller in POCD group (4.75 ± 0.23) than in non-POCD group (5.06 ± 0.31). Hippocampal volume had great influence on Z score, and had negative correlation with Z score. Conclusion: The MRI measurement of hippocampal volume is suggested to be valuable as a predictor of POCD in the elderly."
23368819,Genome-wide analysis of human hotspot intersected genes highlights the roles of meiotic recombination in evolution and disease,Tao Zhou,"Background: Meiotic recombination events are not randomly located, but rather cluster at hotspot regions. Recently, the fine-scale mapping of genome-wide human recombination hotspots was performed. Here, we systematically analyzed the evolutionary and disease-associated features of hotspots that overlapped with protein-coding genes. Results: In this study, we defined hotspot intersected genes as HI genes. We found that HI genes were prone to be located in the extracellular part and were functionally enriched in cell-to-cell communication. Tissue-specific genes and secreted protein encoding genes were overrepresented in HI genes, while housekeeping genes were underrepresented. Compared to slowly evolving housekeeping genes and random genes with lower recombination rates, HI genes evolved faster. The fact that brain and blood specific genes were overrepresented in HI genes indicates that they may be involved in the evolution of human intelligence and the immune system. We also found that genes related to disease were enriched in HI genes, especially genes with disease-associated chromosomal rearrangements. Hotspot sequence motifs were overrepresented in common sequences of HI genes and genes with disease-associated chromosomal rearrangements. We further listed repeat elements that were enriched both in hotspots and genes with disease-associated chromosomal rearrangements. Conclusion: HI genes are evolving and may be involved in the generation of key features of human during evolution. Disease-associated genes may be by-products of meiotic recombination. In addition, hotspot sequence motifs and repeat elements showed the connection between meiotic recombination and genes with disease-associated chromosomal rearrangements at the sequence level. Our study will enable us to better understand the evolutionary and biological significance of human meiotic recombination."
23364961,Health-related quality of life and cognitive functioning at on- and off-treatment periods in children aged between 6-13 years old with brain tumors: a prospective longitudinal study,Kyung Jin An,"Purpose: Our study aimed to examine the relationship between intelligence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children (6-13 years old) diagnosed as having a brain tumor. Materials and methods: We administered a Korean version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III, the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, version 4.0 (PedsQL), the Korean version of the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form, and the Korean Version of the Parenting Sense of Competence (K-PSOC) scale before or after initial radiotherapy (T1) and after treatment termination (T2). In total, 13 patients completed both the T1 and T2 interviews. Results: Scores significantly declined between T1 and T2 on the full-scale intelligence quotients (FIQ), verbal intelligence quotients (VIQ), performance intelligence quotients (PIQ), similarity and coding tests, as well as the K-PSOC, which measures parental anxiety. FIQ scores at T1 were correlated with the self-reported PedsQL total scores (r=0.739) and the parent proxy-report PedsQL scores for school functioning (r=0.706) at T2. Also, the FIQ scores at T2 were correlated with the self-reported PedsQL total scores (r=0.748) and scores for physical health (r=0.728) at T2. Conclusion: The cognitive ability and intelligence level of the patients significantly declined between on and off treatment periods, and higher intelligence functioning at both on and off treatment was correlated with long-term higher HRQOL. Further investigations that monitor intelligence, HRQOL and parenting stress over a longer period, using a greater number of participants, are needed."
23364510,Bitemporal intractable epilepsy: could it be surgically treatable?,Sozari A Chkhenkeli,"Background: The goal of this study is to retrieve the attention to the treatment opportunities for this cohort of intractable bitemporal epilepsy patients who in most cases are not considered optimal candidates for surgery. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that electrophysiologically guided precise surgeries on both temporal lobes can have a beneficial effect on seizures without additional cognitive decline. Methods: Twenty-one intractable bitemporal epilepsy patients [13 men, 8 women, mean age 21 years (range 6-43), mean duration of illness 17 years (range 3-31), frequency of seizures 6-55 per month] underwent stereotactic cryosurgery on both temporal lobes guided by chronic and intraoperative depth electrode studies. Results: Class I ('free of disabling seizures') outcome was achieved for 11/21 (52%), class II ('rare seizures') for 6/21 (29%), and class IV ('no worthwhile improvement') for 4/21 (19%) patients. No worsening of seizure or clinically significant cognitive or memory impairments were observed in this cohort of patients (follow-up 5-10 years). Conclusions: The minimally invasive precise surgeries on both temporal lobes confined to the removal/lesion of just the brain tissue that exhibited epileptic activity can have a beneficial effect on seizure frequency and severity without additional devastating declines in intelligence, learning and memory."
23364150,"Examining the relationship between alopecia areata, androgenetic alopecia, and emotional intelligence",Assaf Monselise,"Background: Emotional stress has been associated with the development of alopecia areata (AA) and androgenetic alopecia (AGA). Emotional intelligence (EI), a component of general intelligence, is thought to govern the recognition, expression, and control of stress and other emotions. People with low EI are unable to adequately control stress in everyday life. Objective: To investigate EI differences between AA and AGA patients and a control population. Methods: Thirty-five AGA patients and 42 AA patients, with patchy (n = 28), ophiasis (n = 5), totalis (n = 5), and universalis (n = 4) distribution of hair loss, completed a 133-item Emotional Quotient-Inventory (EQ-I ) psychometric assessment. Scores were compared between AA, AGA, and 77 control subjects obtained from the North American normative population sample on which the psychometric instrument was normed. Results: Statistically significant differences were found in EI between AA patients and controls with the EQ-I Stress Tolerance scale (p = .005). AGA patients also differed significantly from the controls but to a lesser degree compared toAA patients. In overall EI, there were no apparent differences between AGA and AA patients. Conclusions: AA and AGA patients exhibit a mild depressive reaction to their condition, with AA patients demonstrating a significantly stronger deficiency in coping with stress than AGA patients. The data support a psychosomatic contribution to AA. Referral of patients for EI assessment and psychosocial counseling could help reduce stress."
23364117,Borderline personality disorder and emotional intelligence,Mathell Peter,"The present study investigated emotional intelligence (EI) in borderline personality disorder (BPD). It was hypothesized that patients with BPD (n = 61) compared with patients with other personality disorders (PDs; n = 69) and nonpatients (n = 248) would show higher scores on the ability to perceive emotions and impairments in the ability to regulate emotions. EI was assessed with the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (Mayer, Salovey, and Caruso [New York: MHS, 2002]). As compared with the PD group and the nonpatient group, the patients with BPD displayed the anticipated deficits in their ability to understand, whereas no differences emerged with respect to their ability to perceive, use, and regulate emotions. In addition, a negative relationship was found between the severity of BPD and total EI score. However, this relationship disappeared when intelligence quotient was partialled out. These results suggest that BPD is associated with emotion understanding deficits, whereas temporary severity of BPD is associated with emotion regulation deficits."
23363537,Intraindividual neuropsychological test variability in healthy individuals with high average intelligence and educational attainment,Daniel J Heyanka,"Knowledge of patterns of neuropsychological performance among normal, healthy individuals is integral to the practice of clinical neuropsychology, because clinicians may not always account for intraindividual variability (IIV) before coming to diagnostic conclusions. The IIV was assessed among a sample of 46 healthy individuals with high average intelligence and educational attainment, utilizing a battery of neuropsychological tests, including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) and Wechsler Memory Scale, Fourth Edition (WMS-IV). The data indicated substantial variability in neurocognitive abilities. All participants were found to demonstrate scores considered impaired by at least 2 standard deviations (SDs). Despite adjusting for outliers, no participant produced a ""normal"" testing profile with an intraindividual maximum discrepancy (MD) of less than 1 SD in either direction. When WAIS-IV Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) was considered, participants generally demonstrated cognitive test scores ranging from 2 SDs less than to 1.5 SDs greater than their FSIQ. Furthermore, after demographic corrections, the majority (59%) of participants demonstrated at least 1 impaired cognitive test score, as defined by being 1 to 1.5 SDs below the mean. Overall, results substantiate the need for clinicians to consider FSIQ and educational attainment in interpretation of neuropsychological testing results, given the relevant commonality of ""abnormal"" test scores within this population. This may ultimately reduce the likelihood of making false-positive conclusions of impairment when educational attainment and intelligence are high, thus improving diagnostic accuracy."
23362804,Neurological and intellectual disabilities among adolescents within a custodial institution in South-West Nigeria,O Atilola,"A total of 67 adolescents from a juvenile remand home were matched with 67 other adolescents by age and gender, with a view to determine the prevalence and spectrum of neurological and intellectual disabilities. Intelligence quotient (IQ) was estimated using an adapted version of the Slosson's Intelligence Test and a full neurological evaluation was carried out. The mean IQ score for the remand home participants was significantly lower than the controls (77 ± 11 vs. 99 ± 14; t = 1.6, P = 0.001). Almost half (46.7%) of the participants in the remand home had intellectual disability of varying degrees, including borderline intellectual functioning, compared with only two (3.3%) of the comparison group (P < 0.001). Epilepsy and neurological deficits were significantly more prevalent among the remand home group, particularly those admitted as victims of neglect, compared with the comparison group (P ≤ 0.02). These findings and recent literature were used to speculate the possible underlying factors. Policy implications for child social welfare in Nigeria were suggested."
23361637,Effect of carotid endarterectomy on cognitive function in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis,Akiko Takaiwa,"Background: This study was conducted to determine if patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis show cognitive function decline, and if they experience any changes in cognitive function after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Method: Cognitive function was examined in 15 patients (12 males and three females, 70.0 ± 6.5 years) with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis before and 3 months after CEA. Cognitive function was assessed with the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), two subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R 2 subtests), and the Japanese version of National Adult Reading Test (JART). The patients' average scores were compared with the normal average by one-sample t-tests, and the before and after scores were compared with paired t-tests. Changes in each patient were calculated from difference before and after CEA using 95 % confidence intervals. Results: Before surgery, patients showed significant cognitive decline in RBANS total scale and immediate memory, language, and attention. At 3 months after CEA, the total scale and the immediate memory were not significantly different from the normal average. The average total scale score, the immediate memory and attention, and the WAIS-R 2 subtests scores were increased after treatment. Changes in each patient were calculated from the scores before and after CEA. At 3 months after CEA, the rate of increase in RBANS scores were 60.0 % of the patients for immediate memory, 26.7 % for visuospatial/constructional, 33.3 % for language and attention, 26.7 % for delayed memory, 47.7 % for total scale and 26.7 % for WAIS-R 2 subtests. Thus, so-called asymptomatic patients exhibit mild cognitive impairment before surgery, but after CEA, patients recover normal memory abilities. Conclusions: Our findings of mild cognitive dysfunction in asymptomatic patients suggest that they might be symptomatic after all."
23361519,Effects of methylphenidate on resting-state brain activity in normal adults: an fMRI study,Yihong Zhu,"Methylphenidate (MPH) is one of the most commonly used stimulants for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although several studies have evaluated the effects of MPH on human brain activation during specific cognitive tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), few studies have focused on spontaneous brain activity. In the current study, we investigated the effect of MPH on the intra-regional synchronization of spontaneous brain activity during the resting state in 18 normal adult males. A handedness questionnaire and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale were applied before medication, and a resting-state fMRI scan was obtained 1 h after medication (20 mg MPH or placebo, order counterbalanced between participants). We demonstrated that: (1) there were no significant differences in the performance of behavioral tasks between the MPH and placebo groups; (2) the left middle and superior temporal gyri had stronger MPHrelated regional homogeneity (ReHo); and (3) the left lingual gyrus had weaker MPH-related ReHo. Our findings showed that the ReHo in some brain areas changes with MPH compared to placebo in normal adults, even though there are no behavioral differences. This method can be applied to patients with mental illness who may be treated with MPH, and be used to compare the difference between patients taking MPH and normal participants, to help reveal the mechanism of how MPH works."
23360483,Emotional intelligence competencies provide a developmental curriculum for medical training,James K Stoller,"Since healthcare faces challenges of access, quality, and cost, effective leadership for healthcare is needed. This need is especially acute among physicians, whose demanding training focuses on scientific and clinical skills, eclipsing attention to leadership development. Among the competencies needed by leaders, emotional intelligence (EI) - defined as the ability to understand and manage oneself and to understand others and manage relationships - has been shown to differentiate between great and average leaders. In this context, teaching EI as part of the medical training curriculum is recommended. Furthermore, because physicians' developmental needs evolve over the course of prolonged training, specific components of EI (e.g., teambuilding, empathy, and negotiation) should be taught at various phases of medical training. Consistent with the concept of a spiral curriculum, such EI competencies should be revisited iteratively throughout training, with differing emphasis and increasing sophistication to meet evolving needs. For example, teamwork training is needed early in undergraduate medical curricula to prompt collaborative learning. Teamwork training is also needed during residency, when physicians participate with differing roles on patient care teams. Training in EI should also extend beyond graduate medical training to confer the skills needed by clinicians and by faculty in academic medical centers."
23360444,Word-finding difficulties confound performance on verbal cognitive measures in adults with intractable left temporal lobe epilepsy,Robyn M Busch,"This study sought to determine if word-finding difficulties (WFDs), which are common in adults with dominant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), are related to performance on verbal cognitive measures, including memory. One hundred six individuals with left TLE and pathologically confirmed mesial temporal sclerosis completed comprehensive preoperative neuropsychological evaluations. Patients were divided into two groups based on the degree of benefit received from phonemic cueing on a confrontation naming task. Cognitive performance was then compared between patients with greater and fewer WFDs. Patients with greater WFDs demonstrated poorer performance on many verbal cognitive measures compared to those with fewer WFDs. In contrast, there were no significant differences between groups on any of the nonverbal cognitive measures. Chi-square analyses indicated that below average verbal memory performance occurred at a significantly higher rate for patients with greater WFDs (42-46%) as compared to patients with fewer WFDs (18-24%). Results showed that WFDs confound performance on verbal cognitive measures in adult patients with left TLE, particularly on measures with high demands for lexical retrieval. This suggests that when patients have word-retrieval difficulties, measures of verbal memory and verbal intelligence may be underestimated and potentially lead to misinterpretation of test performance and misinformation regarding risk of declines after surgical resection."
23359579,Validation of rapid neurodevelopmental assessment for 2- to 5-year-old children in Bangladesh,Naila Z Khan,"Objective: Validate a tool to determine neurodevelopmental impairments (NDIs) in >2- to 5-year-old children in a country with limited child development expertise. Methods: Rapid Neurodevelopmental Assessment (RNDA) is a tool designed to detect functional status and NDIs across multiple neurodevelopmental domains. Validity was determined in 77 children enrolled by door-to-door sampling in Dhaka and who were administered the RNDA by 1 of 6 testers (4 developmental therapists, 2 special education teachers) and simultaneously administered a test of adaptive behavior (AB; Independent Behavior Assessment Scale) and intelligence quotient (IQ) tests (Bayley Scales of Infant Development II, Stanford Binet Intelligence Scale, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence) by psychologists. Results: Interrater reliability ranged from good to excellent. There were significant differences in AB in mean percentile scores on the Independent Behavior Assessment Scale for motor (P = .0001), socialization (P = .001), communication (P = .001), and full-scale (P = .001) scores in children with ≥1 NDI (""any NDI"") versus no NDI. Significant differences in those with versus those without ""any NDI"" were found on IQ scores. Sensitivity and specificity for ""significant difficulties"" (defined as AB z-scores < -2 SDs and/or IQ <70) and ""mild difficulties included"" (AB z-scores < -1SD and/or IQ <85) were 90% and 60% and 80% and 76%, respectively. Conclusions: The RNDA validity results are promising for use by child care professionals in field and clinical settings, but the tool needs further replication and refinement for assessment of specific impairments of vision, hearing, and seizures."
23359015,Creativity in cannabis-users and in drug addicts in maintenance treatment and in rehabilitation],Brigitta Bliem,"The main aim of this study was to investigate potential differences between different groups of drug addicts (patients in maintenance treatment, n = 14; patients in rehabilitation, n = 12) and Cannabis-Users (n = 13), along with a healthy control group (n = 18), with respect to verbal and figural creativity and general cognitive ability. Participants worked on different measures for the assessment of different facets of creativity, intelligence and experienced psychiatric symptoms. The results indicated that patients in maintenance and, to some extent Cannabis-Users scored higher regarding verbal creativity than patients in rehabilitation. With respect to figural creativity we observed no differences between the experimental groups. Concerning the Big Five personality traits, patients in maintenance treatment scored highest on Neuroticism while on a purely descriptive level Cannabis-Users achieved the highest scores with respect to openness to experience and extraversion."
23358157,DNA evidence for strong genetic stability and increasing heritability of intelligence from age 7 to 12,M Trzaskowski,"Two genetic findings from twin research have far-reaching implications for understanding individual differences in the development of brain function as indexed by general cognitive ability (g, aka intelligence): (1) The same genes affect g throughout development, even though (2) heritability increases. It is now possible to test these hypotheses using DNA alone. From 1.7 million DNA markers and g scores at ages 7 and 12 on 2875 children, the DNA genetic correlation from age 7 to 12 was 0.73, highly similar to the genetic correlation of 0.75 estimated from 6702 pairs of twins from the same sample. DNA-estimated heritabilities increased from 0.26 at age 7 to 0.45 at age 12; twin-estimated heritabilities also increased from 0.35 to 0.48. These DNA results confirm the results of twin studies indicating strong genetic stability but increasing heritability for g, despite mean changes in brain structure and function from childhood to adolescence."
23358156,"Childhood intelligence is heritable, highly polygenic and associated with FNBP1L",B Benyamin,"Intelligence in childhood, as measured by psychometric cognitive tests, is a strong predictor of many important life outcomes, including educational attainment, income, health and lifespan. Results from twin, family and adoption studies are consistent with general intelligence being highly heritable and genetically stable throughout the life course. No robustly associated genetic loci or variants for childhood intelligence have been reported. Here, we report the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) on childhood intelligence (age range 6-18 years) from 17,989 individuals in six discovery and three replication samples. Although no individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected with genome-wide significance, we show that the aggregate effects of common SNPs explain 22-46% of phenotypic variation in childhood intelligence in the three largest cohorts (P=3.9 × 10(-15), 0.014 and 0.028). FNBP1L, previously reported to be the most significantly associated gene for adult intelligence, was also significantly associated with childhood intelligence (P=0.003). Polygenic prediction analyses resulted in a significant correlation between predictor and outcome in all replication cohorts. The proportion of childhood intelligence explained by the predictor reached 1.2% (P=6 × 10(-5)), 3.5% (P=10(-3)) and 0.5% (P=6 × 10(-5)) in three independent validation cohorts. Given the sample sizes, these genetic prediction results are consistent with expectations if the genetic architecture of childhood intelligence is like that of body mass index or height. Our study provides molecular support for the heritability and polygenic nature of childhood intelligence. Larger sample sizes will be required to detect individual variants with genome-wide significance."
23357116,Working memory training is associated with lower prefrontal cortex activation in a divergent thinking task,O Vartanian,"Working memory (WM) training has been shown to lead to improvements in WM capacity and fluid intelligence. Given that divergent thinking loads on WM and fluid intelligence, we tested the hypothesis that WM training would improve performance and moderate neural function in the Alternate Uses Task (AUT)-a classic test of divergent thinking. We tested this hypothesis by administering the AUT in the functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner following a short regimen of WM training (experimental condition), or engagement in a choice reaction time task not expected to engage WM (active control condition). Participants in the experimental group exhibited significant improvement in performance in the WM task as a function of training, as well as a significant gain in fluid intelligence. Although the two groups did not differ in their performance on the AUT, activation was significantly lower in the experimental group in ventrolateral prefrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices-two brain regions known to play dissociable and critical roles in divergent thinking. Furthermore, gain in fluid intelligence mediated the effect of training on brain activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that a short regimen of WM training is associated with lower prefrontal activation-a marker of neural efficiency-in divergent thinking."
23357078,Neuroanatomic overlap between intelligence and cognitive factors: morphometry methods provide support for the key role of the frontal lobes,Roberto Colom,"Evidence from neuroimaging studies suggests that intelligence differences may be supported by a parieto-frontal network. Research shows that this network is also relevant for cognitive functions such as working memory and attention. However, previous studies have not explicitly analyzed the commonality of brain areas between a broad array of intelligence factors and cognitive functions tested in the same sample. Here fluid, crystallized, and spatial intelligence, along with working memory, executive updating, attention, and processing speed were each measured by three diverse tests or tasks. These twenty-one measures were completed by a group of one hundred and four healthy young adults. Three cortical measures (cortical gray matter volume, cortical surface area, and cortical thickness) were regressed against psychological latent scores obtained from a confirmatory factor analysis for removing test and task specific variance. For cortical gray matter volume and cortical surface area, the main overlapping clusters were observed in the middle frontal gyrus and involved fluid intelligence and working memory. Crystallized intelligence showed an overlapping cluster with fluid intelligence and working memory in the middle frontal gyrus. The inferior frontal gyrus showed overlap for crystallized intelligence, spatial intelligence, attention, and processing speed. The fusiform gyrus in temporal cortex showed overlap for spatial intelligence and attention. Parietal and occipital areas did not show any overlap across intelligence and cognitive factors. Taken together, these findings underscore that structural features of gray matter in the frontal lobes support those aspects of intelligence related to basic cognitive processes."
23356683,Exploratory and higher order factor analysis of the WJ-III full test battery: a school-aged analysis,Stefan C Dombrowski,"Development of the Woodcock-Johnson (3rd ed.; WJ-III; Woodcock, McGrew & Mather, 2001a) was guided in part by Carroll's (1993) 3-stratum theory of cognitive abilities and based on confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), even though Carroll used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to derive his theory. Using CFA, McGrew and Woodcock (2001) found a 9-factor model across all age ranges. To determine if the 9-factor structure holds for the full WJ-III battery, we applied currently recognized best practices in EFA to 2 school-aged 42-subtest correlation matrices (ages 9–13 and 14–19 years). Six factors emerged at the 9–13 age range, while 5 factors were indicated at the 14–19 age range. The resulting 1st-order factors displayed patterns of both convergence with and divergence from the WJ-III results presented in the Technical Manual. These results also revealed a robust manifestation of general intelligence (g) that dwarfed the variance attributed to the lower order factors. It is surprising that this study represents the first time the WJ-III full battery was subjected to EFA analyses given the instrument's significant use by practitioners and that it served as the initial evidentiary basis for Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory. The lack of confirmation of CFA results with EFA methods in the current study permits questioning of the structure of the WJ-III and its relationship with CHC theory. Additional independent, structural analyses are clearly indicated for the WJ-III full test battery before we can be confident in its structure."
23355497,Criminal thinking styles and emotional intelligence in Egyptian offenders,Ahmed M Megreya,"Background: The Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking Styles (PICTS) has been applied extensively to the study of criminal behaviour and cognition. Increasingly growing evidence indicates that criminal thinking styles vary considerably among individuals, and these individual variations appear to be crucial for a full understanding of criminal behaviour. Aims: This study aimed to examine individual differences in criminal thinking as a function of emotional intelligence. Methods: A group of 56 Egyptian male prisoners completed the PICTS and Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i). The correlations between these assessments were examined using a series of Pearson correlations coefficients, with Bonferroni correction. Results: General criminal thinking, reactive criminal thinking and five criminal thinking styles (mollification, cutoff, power orientation, cognitive indolence and discontinuity) negatively correlated with emotional intelligence. On the other hand, proactive criminal thinking and three criminal thinking styles (entitlement, superoptimism and sentimentality) did not associate with emotional intelligence. Conclusions: Emotional intelligence is an important correlate of individual differences in criminal thinking, especially its reactive aspects. Practical implications of this suggestion were discussed."
23354194,Assessing the intelligence of children with chronic kidney diseases,Mostafa Amr,"To evaluate the level of intelligence in children with chronic kidney diseases (CKDs), 12 children with CKD stage 5 on regular hemodialysis, 12 children in the predialysis stage, and 12 as controls were assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). Mean scores on the verbal, performance, and full scale IQ were significantly lower in the predialysis and dialysis children than in the healthy children, while the mean score on the arithmetic subtests was significantly lower in the predialysis children than in the dialysis group. In conclusion, a better understanding of the neurocognitive function in children with CKDs is a critical element to be ascertained early with proper assessment programs so as to design appropriate educational interventions for this handicapping illness."
23353660,Sleep and neurocognitive functioning in children with eczema,Danny Camfferman,"Sleep disruption in childhood is associated with clearly defined deficits in neurocognition and behaviour. Childhood eczema is also a potent cause of sleep disruption though it is unknown whether it too results in neurocognitive deficits. To test this hypothesis, neurocognitive (WISC-IV), parental-reported sleep quality (Sleep Disturbance Scale of Children (SDSC)) and overnight polysomnographic (PSG) data were collected in 21 children with eczema and 20 healthy controls (age range 6-16 years). Children with eczema had worse sleep quality on both PSG (notably increased nocturnal wakefulness, a higher number of stage shifts and a longer latency to REM onset) and parental report. In addition, they demonstrated significant neurocognitive deficits (especially verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning and to a lesser extent working memory) with a composite Full Scale IQ 16 points lower than controls. Parental reported sleep problems but not PSG parameters were correlated with reduced neurocognitive performance. However, hierarchical regression analyses revealed that eczema status was predictive while sleep fragmentation (parental or PSG) was not predictive of neurocognitive performance. As this is the first study to systematically examine neurocognitive functioning in children with eczema and given the finding of significant deficits it merits replication especially given the prevalence of the condition. The unanswered question is whether these cognitive deficits normalise with effective eczema treatment and if this is mediated by improvements in sleep architecture."
23352760,Does neonatal morphine use affect neuropsychological outcomes at 8 to 9 years of age?,Joke de Graaf,"Morphine is widely used to treat severe pain in neonatal intensive care unit patients. Animal studies suggest adverse long-term side effects of neonatal morphine, but a follow-up study of 5-year-old children who participated in a morphine-placebo controlled trial as newborns found no such effects on the child's general functioning. This study indicated that morphine may negatively affect response inhibition, a domain of executive functions. Therefore, we performed a second follow-up study in the same population at the age of 8 to 9 years, focused on the child's general functioning in terms of intelligence, visual motor integration, and behavior and on executive functions. Children in the morphine group showed significantly less externalizing problems according to the parents but more internalizing behavior according to the teachers, but only after adjustment for intelligence quotient (IQ), potential confounders using a propensity score, and additional open-label morphine. Morphine-treated children showed significantly fewer problems with executive functions in daily life as rated by parents for the subscales inhibition and organization of materials and for planning/organizing as rated by the teachers. After adjustment for IQ and the propensity score, executive functioning as rated by the parents remained statistically significantly better in the morphine-treated group. The influence of the additional morphine given was not of a significant influence for any of the outcome variables. Overall, the present study demonstrates that continuous morphine infusion of 10 μg/kg/h during the neonatal period does not harm general functioning and may even have a positive influence on executive functions at 8 to 9 years."
23352199,Fetal antiepileptic drug exposure and cognitive outcomes at age 6 years (NEAD study): a prospective observational study,Kimford J Meador,"Background: Many women of childbearing potential take antiepileptic drugs, but the cognitive effects of fetal exposure are uncertain. We aimed to assess effects of commonly used antiepileptic drugs on cognitive outcomes in children up to 6 years of age. Methods: In this prospective, observational, assessor-masked, multicentre study, we enrolled pregnant women with epilepsy on antiepileptic drug monotherapy (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, or valproate) between October, 1999, and February, 2004, at 25 epilepsy centres in the UK and the USA. Our primary outcome was intelligence quotient (IQ) at 6 years of age (age-6 IQ) in all children, assessed with linear regression adjusted for maternal IQ, antiepileptic drug type, standardised dose, gestational birth age, and use of periconceptional folate. We also assessed multiple cognitive domains and compared findings with outcomes at younger ages. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00021866. Findings: We included 305 mothers and 311 children (six twin pairs) in the primary analysis. 224 children completed 6 years of follow-up (6-year-completer sample). Multivariate analysis of all children showed that age-6 IQ was lower after exposure to valproate (mean 97, 95% CI 94-101) than to carbamazepine (105, 102-108; p=0·0015), lamotrigine (108, 105-110; p=0·0003), or phenytoin (108, 104-112; p=0·0006). Children exposed to valproate did poorly on measures of verbal and memory abilities compared with those exposed to the other antiepileptic drugs and on non-verbal and executive functions compared with lamotrigine (but not carbamazepine or phenytoin). High doses of valproate were negatively associated with IQ (r=-0·56, p<0·0001), verbal ability (r=-0·40, p=0·0045), non-verbal ability (r=-0·42, p=0·0028), memory (r=-0·30, p=0·0434), and executive function (r=-0·42, p=0·0004), but other antiepileptic drugs were not. Age-6 IQ correlated with IQs at younger ages, and IQ improved with age for infants exposed to any antiepileptic drug. Compared with a normative sample (173 [93%] of 187 children), right-handedness was less frequent in children in our study overall (185 [86%] of 215; p=0·0404) and in the lamotrigine (59 [83%] of 71; p=0·0287) and valproate (38 [79%] of 40; p=0·0089) groups. Verbal abilities were worse than non-verbal abilities in children in our study overall and in the lamotrigine and valproate groups. Mean IQs were higher in children exposed to periconceptional folate (108, 95% CI 106-111) than they were in unexposed children (101, 98-104; p=0·0009). Interpretation: Fetal valproate exposure has dose-dependent associations with reduced cognitive abilities across a range of domains at 6 years of age. Reduced right-handedness and verbal (vs non-verbal) abilities might be attributable to changes in cerebral lateralisation induced by exposure to antiepileptic drugs. The positive association of periconceptional folate with IQ is consistent with other recent studies."
23351106,The effectiveness of narrative therapy with young people with autism,Andrew Cashin,"Problem: The aim of this pilot study was to be the first step toward empirically determining whether narrative therapy is effective in helping young people with autism who present with emotional and behavioral problems. Autism is increasingly being recognized in young people with average and above intelligence. Because of the nature of autism, these young people have difficulty navigating the challenges of school and adolescence. Narrative therapy can help them with their current difficulties and also help them develop skills to address future challenges. Narrative therapy involves working with a person to examine and edit the stories the person tells himself or herself about the world. It is designed to promote social adaptation while working on specific problems of living. Method: This pilot intervention study used a convenience sample of 10 young people with autism (10-16 years) to evaluate the effectiveness of five 1 hr sessions of narrative therapy conducted over 10 weeks. The study used the parent-rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures were the Kessler-10 Scale of Psychological Distress (K-10), the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and a stress biomarker, the salivary cortisol to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) ratio. Findings: Significant improvement in psychological distress identified through the K-10 was demonstrated. Significant improvement was identified on the Emotional Symptoms Scale of the SDQ. The cortisol:DHEA ratio was responsive and a power analysis indicated that further study is indicated with a larger sample. Conclusion: Narrative therapy has merit as an intervention with young people with autism. Further research is indicated."
23347963,Intelligence and executive functions in frontotemporal dementia,María Roca,"Recently (Roca et al. (2010), we used the relationship with general intelligence (Spearman's g) to define two sets of frontal lobe or ""executive"" tests. For one group, including Wisconsin card sorting and verbal fluency, reduction in g entirely explained the deficits found in frontal patients. For another group, including tests of social cognition and multitasking, frontal deficits remained even after correction for g. Preliminary evidence suggested a link of the latter tasks to more anterior frontal regions. Here we develop this distinction in the context of behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a disorder which progressively affects frontal lobe cortices. In bvFTD, some executive tests, including tests of social cognition and multitasking, decline from the early stage of the disease, while others, including classical executive tests such as Wisconsin card sorting, verbal fluency or Trail Making Test part B, show deficits only later on. Here we show that, while deficits in the classical executive tests are entirely explained by g, deficits in the social cognition and multitasking tests are not. The results suggest a relatively selective cognitive deficit at mild stages of the disease, followed by more widespread cognitive decline well predicted by g."
23343011,Cognitive remediation in schizophrenia: efficacy and effectiveness in patients with early versus long-term course of illness,Christopher R Bowie,"Aim: We examined the efficacy and effectiveness (transfer to functional competence and everyday functioning) of cognitive remediation in early-course (within 5 years of first episode) and long-term (more than 15 years of illness) schizophrenia. Methods: Treatment lasted 12 weeks and included computerized exercises, strategic monitoring and methods to transfer cognition to behaviour. Assessments included a standard battery of neurocognition, performance-based measures of social and adaptive competence, and case manager ratings of real-world functional behaviour. Changes from baseline to post-treatment were examined with repeated measures analysis of variance and estimated premorbid intelligence and total months in hospital as covariates. Results: The early-course group had larger improvements in measures of processing speed and executive functions, as well as larger improvements in adaptive competence and real-world work skills. Duration of illness was inversely associated with improvement in neurocognition and real-world work skills. Conclusions: Treatment of cognitive impairments is feasible in both early-course and chronic schizophrenia, but the clinical meaningfulness and generalization to functioning appear to be more substantial when delivered early. Cognitive remediation should be considered a tool for early intervention in schizophrenia."
23337082,Process-based account for the effects of perceptual attention and executive attention on fluid intelligence: an integrative approach,Xuezhu Ren,"Perceptual attention and executive attention represent two higher-order types of attention and associate with distinctly different ways of information processing. It is hypothesized that these two types of attention implicate different cognitive processes, which are assumed to account for the differential effects of perceptual attention and executive attention on fluid intelligence. Specifically, an encoding process is assumed to be crucial in completing the tasks of perceptual attention while two executive processes, updating and shifting, are stimulated in completing the tasks of executive attention. The proposed hypothesis was tested by means of an integrative approach combining experimental manipulations and psychometric modeling. In a sample of 210 participants the encoding process has proven indispensable in completing the tasks of perceptual attention, and this process accounted for a considerable part of fluid intelligence that was assessed by two figural reasoning tests. In contrast, the two executive processes, updating and shifting, turned out to be necessary in performance according to the tasks of executive attention and these processes accounted for a larger part of the variance in fluid intelligence than that of the processes underlying perceptual attention."
23336440,Role of theory of mind and executive function in explaining social intelligence: a structural equation modeling approach,Zai-Ting Yeh,"Objectives: Social intelligence is the ability to understand others and the social context effectively and thus to interact with people successfully. Research has suggested that the theory of mind (ToM) and executive function may play important roles in explaining social intelligence. The specific aim of the present study was to test with structural equation modeling (SEM) the hypothesis that performance on ToM tasks is more associated with social intelligence in the elderly than is performance on executive functions. Methods: One hundred and seventy-seven participants (age 56-96) completed ToM, executive function, and other basic cognition tasks, and were rated with social intelligence scales. Results: The SEM results showed that ToM and executive function were strongly correlated (0.54); however, only the path coefficient from ToM to social intelligence, and not from executive function, was significant (0.37). Conclusions: ToM performance, but not executive function, was strongly correlated with social intelligence among elderly individuals. ToM and executive function might play different roles in social behavior during normal aging; however, based on the present results, it is possible that ToM might play an important role in social intelligence."
23334840,Predefined three tier business intelligence architecture in healthcare enterprise,Meimei Wang,"Business Intelligence (BI) has caused extensive concerns and widespread use in gathering, processing and analyzing data and providing enterprise users the methodology to make decisions. Different from traditional BI architecture, this paper proposes a new BI architecture, Top-Down Scalable BI architecture with defining mechanism for enterprise decision making solutions and aims at establishing a rapid, consistent, and scalable multiple applications on multiple platforms of BI mechanism. The two opposite information flows in our BI architecture offer the merits of having the high level of organizational prospects and making full use of the existing resources. We also introduced the avg-bed-waiting-time factor to evaluate hospital care capacity."
23334678,Rates and correlates of nonadherence to treatment in obsessive-compulsive disorder,Lívia Santana,"The goal of this cross-sectional study was to identify the rates and correlates of treatment refusal and/or dropout in a treatment-seeking sample of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Specifically, we investigated the relationships between treatment adherence and different OCD dimensions, intelligence, and insight into OCD. The study involved 60 patients with OCD who were being treated in a specialized university OCD clinic. The patients' adherence to standard treatment was assessed with the Treatment Adherence Survey-Patient Version. Patients were also evaluated with the following instruments: the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview 6.0, the Dimensional Yale-Brown ObsessiveCompulsive Scale-short version, the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Sheehan Disability Scale, and the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. The patients with OCD who refused to undertake CBT (46%) displayed greater rates of obsessions with aggressive/violent content. Among patients who started CBT (n=32), 51% withdrew before completing therapy. Patients who refused medication for OCD (52%) displayed greater severity of OCD (particularly hoarding), less insight into symptoms, and greater disability. Of the patients with OCD who were given drug therapy (n=58), 61% reported having taken their medication less frequently and/or at a smaller dose than prescribed or discontinuing the use of medication altogether. Treatment nonadherence is common among patients with OCD. This study found that aggressive/violent obsessions were associated with nonadherence to CBT, while greater severity of OCD (particularly hoarding) and poorer insight were associated with poorer adherence to drug therapy. Future research is needed to clarify whether these OCD phenotypes predict or are the consequence of treatment nonadherence."
23333415,Topological properties of large-scale structural brain networks in children with familial risk for reading difficulties,S M Hadi Hosseini,"Developmental dyslexia is a neurobiological deficit characterized by persistent difficulty in learning to read in children and adults who otherwise possess normal intelligence. Functional and structural connectivity data suggest that developmental dyslexia could be a disconnection syndrome. However, whether abnormalities in connectivity exist in beginning readers at-risk for reading difficulties is unknown. Using graph-theoretical analysis, we investigated differences in global and regional topological properties of structural brain networks in 42 beginning readers with (FH+) and without (FH-) familial risk for reading difficulties. We constructed separate structural correlation networks based on measures of surface area and cortical thickness. Results revealed changes in topological properties in brain regions known to be abnormal in dyslexia (left supramarginal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus) in the FH+ group mainly in the network constructed from measures of cortical surface area. We also found alterations in topological properties in regions that are not often advertised as dyslexia but nonetheless play important role in reading (left posterior cingulate, hippocampus, and left precentral gyrus). To our knowledge, this is the first report of altered topological properties of structural correlation networks in children at risk for reading difficulty, and motivates future studies that examine the mechanisms underlying how these brain networks may mediate the influences of family history on reading outcome."
23333410,Preschool neurological assessment in congenital diaphragmatic hernia survivors: outcome and perinatal factors associated with neurodevelopmental impairment,Enrico Danzer,"Objective: To evaluate the preschool neurodevelopmental outcome in CDH survivors between 2 and 5 years of age and to identify perinatal and postnatal factors that may be predictive of persistent neurological deficits. Methods: The study cohort consists of 60 CDH survivors that were enrolled in our prospective, follow-up program between January 2006 and September 2012. Developmental assessment of study participants between 2 and 3 years of age was performed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 3rd Edition (BSID-III). Cognitive outcomes of CDH children older than 3 years of age were evaluated using The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, 3rd Edition (WPPSI-III). Neurodevelopmental delay was defined by a score of ≤ 85 in any of the evaluated composite scores. Severe impairments were defined as a score of ≤ 69 in at least one domain tested. Results: Mean follow-up for children assessed by BSID-III (n=42) and WPPSI-III (n=18) was 28 ± 4.5 months and 58 ± 4.0 months, respectively. As a group, mean composite and subdomain BSID-III and WPPSI-III scores were within the expected normal range. For the BSID-III group, 9 (22%) had mild deficits in at least one domain, and 6 (14%) had severe deficits in at least one. Only 3 (7%) patients demonstrated severe neurological delays for all BSID-III composite scales. For the WPPSI-III group, 4 (22%) patients scored within the borderline-delayed range for at least one subscale and only one (6%) child had a WPPSI-III VIQ score in the severe delay range. Abnormal muscle tonicity was found in 35% (hypotonicity 33%, hypertonicity 2%). Need for ECMO, prolonged ventilation, hypotonicity, and other surrogate markers of disease severity (P<0.05) were associated with borderline or delayed neurological outcome. Conclusion: The majority of CDH children are functioning in the average range at early preschool and preschool age. Neuromuscular hypotonicity is common in CDH survivors. CDH severity appears to be predictive of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome."
23333116,Decreased fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is associated with lower IQ and earlier illness onset in patients with schizophrenia,Tamás Kovács,"The purpose of this study was to investigate Fragile X Syndrome (FXS)-related mechanisms in schizophrenia, including CGG triplet expansion, FMR1 mRNA, and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) levels in lymphocytes. We investigated 36 patients with schizophrenia and 30 healthy controls using Southern blot analysis, mRNA assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). General intellectual functions were assessed with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III, and the clinical symptoms were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Results revealed that, relative to healthy controls, CGG triplet size and FMR1 mRNA were unaltered in patients with schizophrenia. However, the FMRP level was significantly reduced in patients compared with controls. We found an association between lower FMRP levels, reduced IQ, and earlier illness onset in schizophrenia. Chlorpromazine-equivalent antipsychotic dose did not correlate with FMRP levels. These results raise the possibility of impaired translation of FMR1 mRNA, altered epigenetic regulation, or increased degradation of FMRP in schizophrenia, which may play a role in dysfunctional neurodevelopmental processes and impaired neuroplasticity."
23333061,Recovery of cognitive function after coronary artery bypass graft operations,Kathryn M Bruce,"Background: The effect of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operations on cognition was examined after controlling for the operation, emotional state, preexisting cognitive impairment, and repeated experience with cognitive tests. Methods: On-pump CABG patients (n=16), thoracic surgical patients (n=15), and a nonsurgical control group (n=15) were tested preoperatively, and at 1 and 8 weeks postoperatively, using a battery of cognitive tests and an emotional state assessment. Patient groups were similar in age, sex, level of education, and premorbid intelligence quotient score. Surgical group data were normalized against data from the nonsurgical control group before statistical analysis. Results: CABG patients performed worse on every subtest before the operation, and this disadvantage persisted after the operation. Anxiety, depression, and stress were associated with impaired cognitive performance in the surgical groups 1 week after the operation: 44% of CABG patients and 33% of surgical control patients were significantly impaired; yet, by 8 weeks, nearly all patients had recovered to preoperative levels, with 25% of CABG and 13% of surgical control patients improving beyond their preoperative performance. Conclusions: Stress, anxiety, and depression impair cognitive performance in association with CABG and thoracic operations. Most patients recover to, or exceed, preoperative levels of cognition within 8 weeks. Thus, after controlling for nonsurgical factors, the prospects of a tangible improvement in cognition after CABG are high."
23332576,Mood recognition in bipolar patients through the PSYCHE platform: preliminary evaluations and perspectives,Gaetano Valenza,"Background: Bipolar disorders are characterized by a series of both depressive and manic or hypomanic episodes. Although common and expensive to treat, the clinical assessment of bipolar disorder is still ill-defined. Objective: In the current literature several correlations between mood disorders and dysfunctions involving the autonomic nervous system (ANS) can be found. The objective of this work is to develop a novel mood recognition system based on a pervasive, wearable and personalized monitoring system using ANS-related biosignals. Materials and methods: The monitoring platform used in this study is the core sensing system of the personalized monitoring systems for care in mental health (PSYCHE) European project. It is comprised of a comfortable sensorized t-shirt that can acquire the inter-beat interval time series, the heart rate, and the respiratory dynamics for long-term monitoring during the day and overnight. In this study, three bipolar patients were followed for a period of 90 days during which up to six monitoring sessions and psychophysical evaluations were performed for each patient. Specific signal processing techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms were applied to analyze more than 120 h of data. Results: Experimental results are expressed in terms of confusion matrices and an exhaustive descriptive statistics of the most relevant features is reported as well. A classification accuracy of about 97% is achieved for the intra-subject analysis. Such an accuracy was found in distinguishing relatively good affective balance state (euthymia) from severe clinical states (severe depression and mixed state) and is lower in distinguishing euthymia from the milder states (accuracy up to 88%). Conclusions: The PSYCHE platform could provide a viable decision support system in order to improve mood assessment in patient care. Evidences about the correlation between mood disorders and ANS dysfunctions were found and the obtained results are promising for an effective biosignal-based mood recognition."
23331934,Working memory and intelligence are associated with victoria symptom validity test hard item performance in patients with intractable epilepsy,Therese A Keary,"Loring et al. (Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology, 2005:27;610–617) observed relationships between VSVT hard item performance and IQ and memory indices in epilepsy surgical candidates, with a potential confound of low FSIQ on VSVT performance. The present study replicated the Loring et al. study in a larger sample and extended their findings by examining the relationships among VSVT performance, FSIQ, and working memory. A total of 404 patients with medically intractable epilepsy completed a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Differences in WAIS-III and WMS-III performance were examined as a function of VSVT hard score categories as determined by Grote et al. (2000)--that is, valid, > 20/24; questionable, 18–20; or invalid, < 18. Quantile regression models were constructed to compare the strength of the relationship between FSIQ and VSVT at various points of the FSIQ distribution. Linear regression analyses examined working memory as a potential mediator between FSIQ and VSVT performance. The invalid group performed more poorly than the valid and questionable groups on multiple measures of intelligence and memory. The strength of the relationship between FSIQ and VSVT hard item performance decreased as FSIQ increased, and working memory mediated this relationship. Results suggest VSVT hard item scores may be impacted by working memory difficulties and/or low intellectual functioning."
23331285,Broader autistic phenotype in parents of children with autism: Autism Spectrum Quotient-Turkish version,Sezen Kose,"Aims: The Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) is a self-assessment screening instrument for measuring the degree to which an individual of normal intelligence shows autistic traits. Genetic factors could be responsible for the relatives of individuals with autism exhibiting higher than normal rates of autism-related impairments, referred to as the 'broader autism phenotype' (BAP). The aim of this study was to test whether there is a difference between the parents of autistic and those of typically developing children (TDC) on AQ scores in a Turkish sample. Method: The AQ total and subscale scores of the 100 parents (47 fathers, 53 mothers) of children with autistic disorder (AD) were compared with the 100 parents (48 fathers, 52 mothers) of TDC. Results: The parents of AD children scored significantly higher than the TDC parents on total AQ score, and two of five subscale scores; social skills, and communication. The other three subscales (attention to detail, attention switching, imagination) did not differentiate groups. There was no significant difference between mothers and fathers on any AQ scores, neither in the AD nor TDC group. The group × gender interaction was not significant on the total or the five subscale scores of AQ. Conclusion: Social skill and communication subscales differentiate AD parents more successfully, and are more sensitive, as reported in other studies. The present findings confirm that social skill and communication impairments in parents of children with autism spectrum disorders are indicators of BAP."
23328070,Maternal marginal iodine deficiency affects the expression of relative proteins during brain development in rat offspring,Yuhui Liu,"Marginal iodine deficiency is a major health problem in pregnant women, but its impact on nerve and intelligence development in offspring has been rarely reported. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of maternal marginal iodine deficiency on nerve and cognitive development in offspring and the related mechanisms. Marginal iodine-deficient rats were given 3 μg iodine per day, while normal control rats were given 4 μg iodine daily. Western blot was used to detect the amounts of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and early growth response protein 1 (EGR1) in the hippocampus of each group. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure c-jun and c-fos expression in the hippocampal CA1 region. Finally, the water maze method was used to measure spatial performance. Free thyroxine (FT₄) levels in marginal iodine-deficient rats decreased by about 30%. Seven days after birth, EGR1 and BDNF protein levels significantly decreased in the hippocampus of marginal iodine deficiency rats compared with the normal control group. In addition, c-jun and c-fos expression in the hippocampus of 40-day-old rats was decreased in marginal iodine-deficient rats, compared with control. The spatial learning and memory ability of 40-day-old marginal iodine-deficient rats had a downward trend compared with the normal control group. FT₄ significantly decreased after pregnancy in rats with marginal iodine deficiency, affecting the expression of related proteins in the brain of offspring."
23325731,Executive functioning and behavioral impulsivity of young women who binge eat,Nichole R Kelly,"Objective: To examine the link between binge eating, executive functioning, and behavioral impulsivity. Method: Fifty women who reported engaging in weekly binge eating in the absence of regular compensatory behaviors and 66 women with no history of binge eating completed several self-report questionnaires and a brief neuropsychological battery, including the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task and Conner's Continuous Performance Task. Results: Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that groups did not differ in executive functioning after controlling for depression, anxiety, body mass, general intelligence, and psychotropic medication use. Correlation analyses suggest that individuals who endorse more frequent binge eating might have greater difficulties thinking flexibly or shifting attention. Individuals who binge eats are also more likely to behave impulsively, but only for emotional reasons. Discussion: Although this study is unable to determine whether these cognitive and behavioral factors precede or follow binge-eating episodes, outcomes have implications for treatment and prevention."
23323838,Obesity and impaired cognitive functioning in the elderly: a population-based cross-sectional study (NEDICES),J Benito-León,"Background and purpose: Studies of high body mass index (BMI) and cognition in the elderly have shown conflicting results. While some studies have shown a detrimental effect of high BMI on cognitive function, others have observed beneficial effects on cognition. Our aim was to assess cognitive function in a large population-based sample of overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m(2) ) and obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2) ) community-dwelling elderly participants compared with their counterparts with BMI < 25 kg/m(2) (i.e. controls) living in the same population. Methods: One-thousand nine-hundred and forty-nine population-dwelling participants aged ≥ 65 years in central Spain [the Neurological Diseases in Central Spain study (NEDICES)] underwent a neuropsychological assessment, including tests of global cognitive performance [measured with a 37-item version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (37-MMSE)], psychomotor speed, verbal fluency, memory and pre-morbid intelligence. Results: There were 507 with BMI < 25 kg/m(2) , 850 overweight and 592 obese participants. In regression analyses that adjusted for age, gender, educational category, intake of medications that potentially affect cognition function, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dementia, ever smoker, ever drinker and waist circumference, we found that obese/overweight status was associated with the lowest quartiles of the 37-MMSE, Trail Making Test-A (number of errors; indeed more errors), verbal fluency, delayed free recall, immediate logical memory and pre-morbid intelligence. Conclusions: In this large population sample, overweight and obese participants performed poorer on formal neuropsychological tests than their counterparts with BMI < 25 kg/m(2) . These results support the hypothesis of a detrimental effect of high BMI on impaired cognition in the elderly."
23320575,Perinatal risk factors for neurocognitive impairments in preschool children born very preterm,Eva S Potharst,"Aim: This study aimed to compare a broad array of neurocognitive functions (processing speed, aspects of attention, executive functioning, visual-motor coordination, and both face and emotion recognition) in very preterm and term-born children and to identify perinatal risk factors for neurocognitive dysfunctions. Method: Children who were born very preterm (n=102; 46 males, 56 females), defined as a gestational age of less than 30 weeks and/or birthweight under 1000 g, and a comparison group of term-born children (n=95; 40 males, 55 females) were assessed at age 5 with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Stop Signal Task, several tasks of the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Tasks, and a Digit Span task. Results: When sociodemographic characteristics were taken into account, very preterm children scored worse than term-born children on all neurocognitive functions, except on tasks measuring inhibition and sustained attention, for which results were inconclusive. Effect sizes for group effects were small to medium (r(2) varying between 0.02 and 0.07). Principal component isolated four factors: visual-motor coordination, face/emotion recognition, reaction time/attention, and accuracy/attention. When sociodemographic and child characteristics at birth were accounted for, bronchopulmonary dysplasia was significantly negatively associated with all four components and also with working memory. Interpretation: Very preterm children are at risk for problems on a broad array of neurocognitive functions. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is an independent risk factor for impaired neurocognitive functioning."
23320462,"Plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, learning capacity and cognition in patients with first episode psychosis",Sonia Ruiz de Azua,"Background: Cognitive impairments are seen in first psychotic episode (FEP) patients. The neurobiological underpinnings that might underlie these changes remain unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate whether Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels are associated with cognitive impairment in FEP patients compared with healthy controls. Methods: 45 FEP patients and 45 healthy controls matched by age, gender and educational level were selected from the Basque Country area of Spain. Plasma BDNF levels were assessed in healthy controls and in patients. A battery of cognitive tests was applied to both groups, with the patients being assessed at 6 months after the acute episode and only in those with a clinical response to treatment. Results: Plasma BDNF levels were altered in patients compared with the control group. In FEP patients, we observed a positive association between BDNF levels at six months and five cognitive domains (learning ability, immediate and delayed memory, abstract thinking and processing speed) which persisted after controlling for medications prescribed, drug use, intelligence quotient (IQ) and negative symptoms. In the healthy control group, BDNF levels were not associated with cognitive test scores. Conclusion: Our results suggest that BDNF is associated with the cognitive impairment seen after a FEP. Further investigations of the role of this neurotrophin in the symptoms associated with psychosis onset are warranted."
23320447,The role of general cognitive ability in moderating the relation of adverse life events to emotional and behavioural problems,Eirini Flouri,"Previous studies have established the role of various measures of cognitive functioning in dampening the association between adverse life events ('life stress') and adolescents' emotional and behavioural problems. However, it is not yet clear if general cognitive ability ('intelligence') is a protective factor. In this study of 1,175 10- to 19-year-olds in five secondary schools in England, we explored this issue. We found that even after controlling for sex, age, family poverty, and special educational needs, the association of life stress with emotional, hyperactivity, and conduct problems was significant. General cognitive ability moderated the association between life stress and conduct problems; among adolescents with higher than average general cognitive ability, the association between life stress and conduct problems was non-significant."
23320445,Improving insight and non-insight problem solving with brief interventions,Ming-Ching Wen,"Developing brief training interventions that benefit different forms of problem solving is challenging. In earlier research, Chrysikou (2006) showed that engaging in a task requiring generation of alternative uses of common objects improved subsequent insight problem solving. These benefits were attributed to a form of implicit transfer of processing involving enhanced construction of impromptu, on-the-spot or 'ad hoc' goal-directed categorizations of the problem elements. Following this, it is predicted that the alternative uses exercise should benefit abilities that govern goal-directed behaviour, such as fluid intelligence and executive functions. Similarly, an indirect intervention - self-affirmation (SA) - that has been shown to enhance cognitive and executive performance after self-regulation challenge and when under stereotype threat, may also increase adaptive goal-directed thinking and likewise should bolster problem-solving performance. In Experiment 1, brief single-session interventions, involving either alternative uses generation or SA, significantly enhanced both subsequent insight and visual-spatial fluid reasoning problem solving. In Experiment 2, we replicated the finding of benefits of both alternative uses generation and SA on subsequent insight problem-solving performance, and demonstrated that the underlying mechanism likely involves improved executive functioning. Even brief cognitive- and social-psychological interventions may substantially bolster different types of problem solving and may exert largely similar facilitatory effects on goal-directed behaviours."
23320411,Hospitalisation with otitis media in early childhood and cognitive function in young adult life: a prevalence study among Danish conscripts,Marie Mortensen,"Background: Otitis media (OM) is a very common condition in children and occurs during years that are critical to the development of learning, literacy, and math skills. Therefore, among a large cohort of Danish conscripts, we aimed to examine the association between hospitalisation with OM in early childhood and cognitive function and educational level in early adulthood. Methods: We conducted a population-based prevalence study using linked data from healthcare databases and conscription records of Danish men born between 1977 and 1983. We identified all hospitalisations with OM before 8 years of age. Cognitive function was measured by the Boerge Prien validated group intelligence test (Danish Børge Prien Prøve, BPP). We adjusted for potential confounders with and without stratification by hearing impairment. Furthermore, we examined the association between hospitalisation with OM and the prevalence of having achieved a General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), stratified by quartiles of BPP scores. Results: Of the 18 412 eligible conscripts aged 18-25 years, 1000 (5.5%) had been hospitalised with OM before age 8. Compared with conscripts without such a record, the adjusted prevalence ratio (PR) for a BPP score in the bottom quartile was 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.33). There was no major difference in the proportion of men with a GCSE and those without among those hospitalised with OM in early childhood. For men in the bottom and upper quartiles of BPP scores, the PRs for early childhood hospitalisation with OM were 0.89 (95% CI: 0.59-1.33) and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.88-1.05), respectively. Among men with severe hearing impairment, the proportion with a BPP score in the bottom quartile did not differ between those with and without an OM hospitalisation [PR = 1.01 (95% CI: 0.78-1.34)]. Conclusions: Overall, we found that hospitalisation with OM in early childhood was associated with a slightly lower cognitive function in early adulthood. Hospitalisation for OM did not seem to influence the prevalence of GSCE when level of BPP was taken into account."
23315884,Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification detection of an unknown large deletion of the CREB-binding protein gene in a patient with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome,F Calì,"Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder characterized by postnatal growth retardation, psychomotor developmental delay, skeletal anomalies, peculiar facial morphology, and tumorigenesis. Mutations in the gene encoding the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB, also known as CREBBP or CBP) on chromosome 16p13.3 have been identified. In addition, some patients with low intelligence quotients and autistic features bear large deletions. Based on these observations, we used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification to search for large deletions affecting the CREBBP gene in a Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome patient. We identified a novel heterozygote deletion removing five exons (exons 17-21), encoding the histone acetyltransferase domain. We propose the use of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification as a fast, accurate and cheap test for detecting large deletions in the CREBBP gene in the sub-group of Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome patients with low intelligence quotients and autistic features."
23315684,Social inequalities in health expectancy and the contribution of mortality and morbidity: the case of Irish Travellers,Safa Abdalla,"Background: The health expectancy of Irish Travellers, a disadvantaged indigenous minority group in Ireland has not been previously estimated. This study aimed to examine health expectancy inequalities between Irish Travellers and the general population. Methods: We used Sullivan's life table method to construct healthy life expectancy (HLE) and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE). The All-Ireland Traveller Health Study provided Irish Traveller population's mortality and health data. Vital registration, census and comparable national survey health data were used for the general population. We calculated the absolute and relative life expectancy, HLE and DFLE gaps between Irish Travellers and the general population and decomposed the HLE and DFLE gaps into mortality and morbidity contributions. Results: Irish Travellers had consistently lower HLE and DFLE than the general population. The health expectancy gap displayed notable age and gender variations and was wider than the life expectancy gap. Mortality contributed more than morbidity to the health expectancy gap in men but not in women. Conclusions: This study illustrated the true extent of health inequalities experienced by an indigenous minority in Europe, clarifying the importance of reducing the burden of non-fatal disabling conditions for addressing these inequalities. The health expectancy measure used has application for other similar indigenous minorities elsewhere."
23314065,TeLPI performance in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease: a validation study,Lara Alves,"APA guidelines for the evaluation of age-related cognitive decline and dementia emphasize the need for baseline (premorbid) data against which current performance can be compared. As this information rarely exists, clinicians must rely on instruments especially designed for estimation of premorbid abilities. No such instrument was available in Portugal until the development of the TeLPI, an irregular words oral reading test. This study aims to examine TeLPI's validity as a measure of premorbid ability in the spectrum of aging cognitive decline, from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD), by the analysis of its stability in normal versus impaired samples. A total of 104 patients, classified into 2 clinical groups, MCI (n=53) and probable mild to moderate AD (n=51), were compared with a group of cognitively healthy controls (C_MCI: n=53; C_AD: n=51) and matched for sex, age, education, and residence. As expected, the Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment results were significantly different between the groups (AD<MCI<controls), reflecting the severity of cognitive impairment. TeLPI median scores of controls, MCI, and probable AD patients were comparable after correcting for years of education, revealing no significant effect of cognitive impairment on TeLPI performance, and suggesting its validity for estimating premorbid intelligence in subjects with cognitive decline and dementia."
23313751,A personal retrospective on the second half of the 20th century,K Nicholas Leibovic,"During the Second World War scientists and engineers were involved as never before in all technical phases of the war effort. It included intelligence, logistics and large scale automated computation. Much of this required team work which led to the adoption of interdisciplinary perspectives and found expression after the war in new fields of enquiry such as cybernetics, biophysics and artificial intelligence. While Europe was recovering from its devastation, the United States entered an unprecedented age of prosperity beginning in the 1940s and 50s. The political and budgetary environment was favorable for scientific research and it was felt in Europe as well as the U.S.A. I discuss some of these conditions and the figures associated with the work that became the foundation for advances throughout the second half of the 20th century and conclude with a few observations on quantitative neuroscience and the problem of representation."
23313513,Remarks on neurocybernetics and its links to computing science. To the memory of Prof. Luigi M. Ricciardi,Roberto Moreno-Díaz,"This paper explores the origins and content of neurocybernetics and its links to artificial intelligence, computer science and knowledge engineering. Starting with three remarkable pieces of work, we center attention on a number of events that initiated and developed basic topics that are still nowadays a matter of research and inquire, from goal directed activity theories to circular causality and to reverberations and learning. Within this context, we pay tribute to the memory of Prof. Ricciardi documenting the importance of his contributions in the mathematics of brain, neural nets and neurophysiological models, computational simulations and techniques."
23312690,Sustained developmental effects of the infant behavioral assessment and intervention program in very low birth weight infants at 5.5 years corrected age,Janeline W P Van Hus,"Objective: To evaluate the effect of the Infant Behavioral Assessment and Intervention Program (IBAIP) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants on cognitive, neuromotor, and behavioral development at 5.5 years corrected age (CA). Study design: In a randomized controlled trial, 86 VLBW infants received post discharge IBAIP intervention until 6 months CA, and 90 VLBW infants received standard care. At 5.5 years CA, cognitive and motor development, and visual-motor integration were assessed with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, third Dutch version, the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, second edition, and the Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration. Neurologic conditions were assessed with the neurologic examination according to Touwen, and behavior with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results: At 5.5 years CA, 69 children in the intervention and 67 children in the control group participated (response rate 77.3%). Verbal and performance IQ-scores<85 occurred significantly less often in the intervention than in the control group (17.9% vs 33.3%, P=.041, and 7.5% vs 21.2%, P=.023, respectively). However, after adjustment for differences, only the OR for performance IQ was significant: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.06-0.95. Adjusted mean scores on Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, third version subtasks block design and vocabulary, the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, second edition component aiming and catching, and the Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration were significantly better in the intervention group. No intervention effect was found on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Conclusion: The IBAIP leads, 5 years after the early neurobehavioral intervention, to improvements on performance IQ, ball skills, and visual-motor integration at 5.5 years CA."
23311971,Exploring the relationship between emotional intelligence and health-related quality of life in patients with cancer,Lourdes Rey,"This study examined the association between emotional intelligence (EI), personality, and its relation to health-related quality of life in 62 patients with cancer. Specially, the predictive and incremental validity of EI for predicting health-related quality of life beyond the level attributable to personality was examined. Emotional intelligence showed unique and significant variance in prediction of different health-related quality of life dimensions. These findings provide preliminary evidences that EI abilities are useful additions in the field of psycho-oncology. The potential value of including EI programs to complement current psychoeducational approaches aimed at preserving or improving cancer patient health-related quality of life is discussed."
23303735,Influence of gender and age on cognitive inhibition in late-onset depression: a case-control study,S Richard-Devantoy,"Objective: To compare cognitive inhibition performance between people with early-onset (EOD) or late-onset depression (LOD) and controls, and between women and men with LOD. Methods: On the basis of a case-control design, global executive performance (Frontal Assessment Battery); verbal (Hayling), attention (Stroop), and motor (Go/No-Go) components of cognitive inhibition; mental shifting (Trail Making Test parts A and B); and updating in working memory (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) were assessed in 40 participants (10 depressed women with LOD (i.e., ≥60 years old), 10 depressed women with EOD (i.e., <60 years old), 10 healthy women and 10 depressed men with LOD (i.e., ≥60 years old)). Results: Older depressed women, irrespective of age of depression onset, had greater cognitive inhibition impairments (attention and verbal component) compared with healthy women. LOD was significantly associated with the attention component of cognitive inhibition impairment, unlike EOD (p = 0.026). No executive differences were found regarding age of first-onset depression in older depressed women, and between women and men with LOD. Conclusion: Cognitive inhibition impairment, and more specifically its attention component, was the main characteristic of depression in the studied sample of older adults, independently of gender and age of depression onset. It is essential to perform similar studies in both genders in view of future tailor-made therapeutic modalities."
23302603,"Smoking, hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension as risk factors for cognitive impairment in older adults",Olaoluwa Okusaga,"Background: the prevalence of all types of cognitive impairment, including dementia, is increasing but knowledge of aetiological factors is still evolving. Objective: this study aimed to evaluate the association between cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive function in older persons. Design, setting and subjects: a population-based cohort design involving 2,312 men and women (aged 50-75) enrolled in the University of Edinburgh Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis trial. Methods: cognitive tests included the Mill Hill Vocabulary Scale, auditory verbal learning test (AVLT), digit symbol test, verbal fluency test (VFT), Raven's Progressive Matrices and the trail making test. A 'g' score (measure of general intelligence) was computed for each subject. Regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between relevant variables. Results: higher diastolic BP was negatively associated with AVLT (β = -0.153, P < 0.01), and with an estimated decline on AVLT (β = -0.125, P < 0.01). Smoking was negatively associated with all the cognitive variables except VFT. The total cholesterol level was not associated with cognitive function or estimated decline. Conclusions: smoking and elevated blood pressure may be risk factors for cognitive decline, and thus potential targets for preventive and therapeutic interventions."
23301902,"Comparison of the Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised and the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, 5th Edition, in children with autism spectrum disorders",Sabrina Nicole Grondhuis,"A review of hospital records was conducted for children evaluated for autism spectrum disorders who completed both the Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised (Leiter-R) and Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales, 5th Edition (SB5). Participants were between 3 and 12 years of age. Diagnoses were autistic disorder (n = 26, 55%) and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (n = 21, 45%). Analysis showed that the full sample received significantly higher scores on the Leiter-R than SB5 (mean discrepancy of 20.91 points), specific diagnosis was not a significant factor, and younger children had a larger discrepancy between tests. These analyses strongly suggest that the Leiter-R and the SB5 may not be equivalent measures of intellectual functioning in children with autism spectrum disorders, and that use of one or the other exclusively could lead to misclassification of intellectual capacity."
23300958,Aberrant whole-brain functional connectivity and intelligence structure in children with primary nocturnal enuresis,Bing Yu,"Aim: To assess the potential relationship between intelligence structure abnormalities and whole-brain functional connectivity in children with primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to provide insights into the association between these two seemingly unrelated conditions. Methods: Intelligence testing and fMRI data were obtained from 133 right-handed children, including 67 PNE children (M/F, 39:28; age, 10.5 ± 1.2 y) and 66 age-matched healthy controls (M/F, 37:29; age, 10.1 ± 1.1 y). All intelligence tests were performed using the China-Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (C-WISC). Each subject's full intelligence quotient (FIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ), and memory/caution (M/C) factor was measured and recorded. Resting state fMRI scans were performed on a 3.0-T MR scanner and post-processed using REST software. Comparisons of z-score correlation coefficients between distinct cerebral regions were used to identify altered functional connectivity in PNE children. Results: The PNE group had normal FIQ, VIQ, and PIQ values, indicating no significant variation from the control group. However, the M/C factor was significantly lower in the PNE group. Compared to the control group, PNE children exhibited overall lower levels of functional connectivity that were most apparent in the cerebello-thalamo-frontal pathway. The M/C factor significantly correlated with z-scores representing connectivity between Cerebellum_Crus1_L and Frontal_Mid_R. Conclusion: PNE children exhibit intelligence structure imbalance and attention deficits. Our findings suggest that cerebello-thalamo-frontal circuit abnormalities are likely to be involved in the onset and progression of attention impairment in PNE children."
23298794,A behavior genetic analysis of trait emotional intelligence and alexithymia: a replication,Holly M Baughman,"This replication study examines relations between alexithymia and trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) at the phenotypic, genetic, and environmental levels. A sample of 1,444 same-sex twin pairs (850 MZ pairs and 594 DZ pairs) completed the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20. A subset of 494 same-sex twin pairs (287 MZ pairs and 207 DZ pairs) had earlier completed the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire. Individual differences in alexithymia were attributable to genetic, non-shared environmental, and shared environmental factors. All but one of the facets of alexithymia were negatively and significantly correlated with the factors of trait EI, and these phenotypic correlations were entirely attributable to correlated genetic and correlated non-shared environmental factors. These bivariate results provide a valuable replication of those of Baughman et al. (Twin Research and Human Genetics, Vol. 14, 2011, pp. 539-543), which was conducted with substantially smaller samples of twins."
23298775,More than intelligence: distinct cognitive/behavioral clusters linked to adaptive dysfunction in children,Aimilia Papazoglou,"Impairments in adaptive functioning are frequently associated with intellectual disability (ID); however, adaptive dysfunction can be seen in many individuals with a variety of neurological conditions without ID. The extent to which other variables may be associated with adaptive dysfunction is unclear. In a mixed clinical sample of children (n = 348) consecutively referred for neuropsychological evaluation, the majority were rated as showing weak adaptive skills (ABAS-II, >1 SD below the mean; 71%), with a substantial proportion evidencing frank impairment (>2 SD below the mean, 45%). We examined patterns of scores on measures of intelligence (WISC-IV) and behavioral/affective dysregulation (BRIEF and BASC-2). Using hierarchical cluster analysis, a four cluster model yielded the most appropriate fit and adaptive functioning was subsequently examined across clusters. As expected, adaptive functioning was most intact in the cluster characterized by average IQ and minimal behavioral dysregulation. Other clusters were marked by adaptive dysfunction and distinguished by sub-average intellectual functioning and varying behavioral/emotional dysregulation. In contrast to traditional views associating low IQ with adaptive dysfunction, adaptive impairment was comparable between the cluster characterized by low intelligence and the cluster with average intelligence but significant behavioral dysregulation. These data suggest that adaptive functioning should be considered across various cognitive/behavioral conditions."
23298735,Decision making after traumatic brain injury: a temporal discounting paradigm,Rodger Ll Wood,"A temporal discounting paradigm was used to examine decision making for hypothetical monetary reward following traumatic brain injury (TBI). A case-control design compared individuals following moderate or severe TBI with a healthy control group matched for age and gender. The impact of intelligence, impulsivity, and mood on temporal discounting performance was examined. A within-subjects design for the TBI group determined the influence of a range of neuropsychological tests on temporal discounting performance. Both patients and controls demonstrated temporal discounting. However, the TBI group discounted more than controls, suggesting that their decision making was more impulsive, consistent with ratings on the impulsiveness questionnaire. Discounting performance was independent of neuropsychological measures of intelligence, memory, and executive function. There was no relationship between temporal discounting and ratings of everyday executive function made by patients' relatives. Low mood did not account for discounting performance. The results of this study suggest that temporal discounting may be a useful neuropsychological paradigm to assess decision making linked to monetary reward following TBI. Performance was relatively independent of intelligence, memory and standard tests of executive ability and may therefore assist when assessing a patient's mental capacity to manage their financial affairs."
23298085,Real-time automatic fiducial marker tracking in low contrast cine-MV images,Wei-Yang Lin,"Purpose: To develop a real-time automatic method for tracking implanted radiographic markers in low-contrast cine-MV patient images used in image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). Methods: Intrafraction motion tracking using radiotherapy beam-line MV images have gained some attention recently in IGRT because no additional imaging dose is introduced. However, MV images have much lower contrast than kV images, therefore a robust and automatic algorithm for marker detection in MV images is a prerequisite. Previous marker detection methods are all based on template matching or its derivatives. Template matching needs to match object shape that changes significantly for different implantation and projection angle. While these methods require a large number of templates to cover various situations, they are often forced to use a smaller number of templates to reduce the computation load because their methods all require exhaustive search in the region of interest. The authors solve this problem by synergetic use of modern but well-tested computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques; specifically the authors detect implanted markers utilizing discriminant analysis for initialization and use mean-shift feature space analysis for sequential tracking. This novel approach avoids exhaustive search by exploiting the temporal correlation between consecutive frames and makes it possible to perform more sophisticated detection at the beginning to improve the accuracy, followed by ultrafast sequential tracking after the initialization. The method was evaluated and validated using 1149 cine-MV images from two prostate IGRT patients and compared with manual marker detection results from six researchers. The average of the manual detection results is considered as the ground truth for comparisons. Results: The average root-mean-square errors of our real-time automatic tracking method from the ground truth are 1.9 and 2.1 pixels for the two patients (0.26 mm/pixel). The standard deviations of the results from the 6 researchers are 2.3 and 2.6 pixels. The proposed framework takes about 128 ms to detect four markers in the first MV images and about 23 ms to track these markers in each of the subsequent images. Conclusions: The unified framework for tracking of multiple markers presented here can achieve marker detection accuracy similar to manual detection even in low-contrast cine-MV images. It can cope with shape deformations of fiducial markers at different gantry angles. The fast processing speed reduces the image processing portion of the system latency, therefore can improve the performance of real-time motion compensation."
23297860,Cognitive impairment and cortical reorganization in children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes,Alexandre N Datta,"Purpose: Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is associated with mild cognitive deficits, especially language impairment. This study aimed to clarify whether children with BECTS with left- or right-hemispheric, or bilateral focus have specific neuropsychological language deficits when compared to healthy controls, whether these deficits correlate functionally with language network organization (typical vs. atypical), and whether cofactors such as duration, handedness, and medication have a relevant impact on language reorganization processes. Methods: Twenty-seven patients and 19 healthy controls were examined with several neuropsychological tests (German version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children [WISC-IV], Regensburger verbal fluency test [RWT], Corsiblock forward and backward and Hand-Dominanz-Test [HDT]) and with two language paradigms on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): silent reading of word-pairs and silent generation of simple sentences. Key findings: Although neuropsychological test results only differed by trend between BECTS patients and controls, language laterality indices (LIs) in fMRI were significantly lower in patients than in controls. In particular, the anterior language network with Broca's area and the supplementary motor area (SMA) revealed the lowest LIs and showed the most bilateral or right hemispheric activations in the sentence generation task. Medication and duration of epilepsy did not have any significant effect on language reorganization and patients' performances. Significance: Language reorganization in BECTS patients takes place in bilateral or right hemispheric language networks, with a strong focus in anterior language regions. These functional changes can be interpreted as important compensatory strategies of the central nervous system (CNS) to stabilize cognitive, especially language performance."
23295077,Expressive and receptive language in Prader-Willi syndrome: report on genetic subtype differences,Anastasia Dimitropoulos,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), most recognized for the hallmark hyperphagia and food preoccupations, is caused by the absence of expression of the paternally active genes in the q11-13 region of chromosome 15. Since the recognition of PWS as a genetic disorder, most research has focused primarily on the medical, genetic, and behavioral aspects of the syndrome. Extensive research has not been conducted on the cognitive, speech, and language abilities in PWS. In addition, language differences with regard to genetic mechanism of PWS have not been well investigated. To date, research indicates overall language ability is markedly below chronological age with expressive language more impaired than receptive language in people with PWS. Thus, the aim of the present study was to further characterize expressive and receptive language ability in 35 participants with PWS and compare functioning by genetic subtype using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-4 (CELF-IV). Results indicate that core language ability is significantly impaired in PWS and both expressive and receptive abilities are significantly lower than verbal intelligence. In addition, participants with the maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD) genetic subtype exhibit discrepant language functioning with higher expressive vs. receptive language abilities. Future research is needed to further examine language functioning in larger genetic subtype participant samples using additional descriptive measures. Further work should also delineate findings with respect to size of the paternal deletion (Type 1 and Type 2 deletions) and explore how overexpression of maternally expressed genes in the 15q11-13 region may relate to verbal ability. Learning outcomes: After reading this article, the reader will be able to: (1) summarize primary characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), (2) describe differentiating characteristics for the PWS genetic subtypes, (3) recall limited research regarding language functioning in PWS to date, (4) summarize potential genetic variations of language ability in Prader-Willi syndrome, and (5) summarize language ability in PWS with respect to adaptive functioning."
23294674,Training in empathic skills improves the patient-physician relationship during the first consultation in a fertility clinic,Désirée García,"Objective: To evaluate the effect of physician training in empathic skills on patients' satisfaction just after their first consultation in a private fertility clinic setting. Design: Prospective study. Setting: Private fertility clinic. Patient(s): Thirteen physicians were evaluated by 2,146 patients. Intervention(s): The empathic training of physicians was centered on emotional intelligence, communication elements, social styles and empathy, and practical workshops. After their first consultation with the physician, patients answered a self-rating questionnaire comprising five scales: information provided, dynamic of the visit, time dedicated, patient-physician interaction, and expertise. Main outcome measure(s): Patients' satisfaction scores after the empathic training of physicians. Result(s): For all five scales, the empathic training resulted in a significant change of the global scoring distribution with a shift toward higher scores. The intervention also resulted in a lower likelihood of low scoring (in the lower quartile) for all the items. Conclusion(s): Training in empathic skills of physicians resulted in higher patient satisfaction levels on the perceived information quality, communication skills, and time dedicated at first consultation for fertility treatment."
23291686,Clinical and serial MRI findings of a sialidosis type I patient with a novel missense mutation in the NEU1 gene,Yoshiki Sekijima,"The case of a Japanese sialidosis type I patient with a novel NEU1 gene mutation is described. The patient developed an unsteady gait at age 14 and was referred to our hospital at age 16. On admission, subnormal intelligence, dysarthria, myoclonus, intentional tremors, limb and gait ataxia, hyperreflexia and macular cherry-red spots were observed. An enzymological analysis revealed a primary deficiency of neuraminidase. An NEU1 gene analysis identified two heterozygous missense mutations: p.P80L and p.D135N. The p.D135N mutation is a novel mutation that is considered to be associated with the mild clinical phenotype of sialidosis. Serial brain MRI showed diffuse brain atrophy progressing rapidly over the 41-month observation period."
23289875,Economic benefits of methylmercury exposure control in Europe: monetary value of neurotoxicity prevention,Martine Bellanger,"Background: Due to global mercury pollution and the adverse health effects of prenatal exposure to methylmercury (MeHg), an assessment of the economic benefits of prevented developmental neurotoxicity is necessary for any cost-benefit analysis. Methods: Distributions of hair-Hg concentrations among women of reproductive age were obtained from the DEMOCOPHES project (1,875 subjects in 17 countries) and literature data (6,820 subjects from 8 countries). The exposures were assumed to comply with log-normal distributions. Neurotoxicity effects were estimated from a linear dose-response function with a slope of 0.465 Intelligence Quotient (IQ) point reduction per μg/g increase in the maternal hair-Hg concentration during pregnancy, assuming no deficits below a hair-Hg limit of 0.58 μg/g thought to be safe. A logarithmic IQ response was used in sensitivity analyses. The estimated IQ benefit cost was based on lifetime income, adjusted for purchasing power parity. Results: The hair-mercury concentrations were the highest in Southern Europe and lowest in Eastern Europe. The results suggest that, within the EU, more than 1.8 million children are born every year with MeHg exposures above the limit of 0.58 μg/g, and about 200,000 births exceed a higher limit of 2.5 μg/g proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). The total annual benefits of exposure prevention within the EU were estimated at more than 600,000 IQ points per year, corresponding to a total economic benefit between €8,000 million and €9,000 million per year. About four-fold higher values were obtained when using the logarithmic response function, while adjustment for productivity resulted in slightly lower total benefits. These calculations do not include the less tangible advantages of protecting brain development against neurotoxicity or any other adverse effects. Conclusions: These estimates document that efforts to combat mercury pollution and to reduce MeHg exposures will have very substantial economic benefits in Europe, mainly in southern countries. Some data may not be entirely representative, some countries were not covered, and anticipated changes in mercury pollution all suggest a need for extended biomonitoring of human MeHg exposure."
23288449,Childhood cognitive development after fetal growth restriction,E Llurba,"Objective: To examine the relationship between prenatal umbilical artery (UA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) Doppler findings and cognitive development at 3 and 6 years in low-birth-weight children. Methods: This was a study of 209 low-birth-weight (< 10(th) centile) children born after 28 gestational weeks with UA resistance index (RI) measured within 2 weeks before delivery. Children with normal UA- and ICA-RI were defined as small-for-gestational age (SGA) and those with abnormal UA or ICA Doppler findings as having fetal growth restriction (FGR). Cognitive ability at 3 and 6 years' corrected age was assessed using the fourth edition of the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (SBIS) and compared between SGA and FGR groups. An SBIS score < 85 was considered to indicate delayed development. Results: The median gestational age at diagnosis of abnormal fetal growth was 36.6 (range, 28-41) weeks. There were 87 (41.6%) children classified as having FGR and 122 (58.4%) as SGA. The mean global SBIS score at 3 years was 109.4 (SD, 22.8) and at 6 years it was 110.5 (SD, 13.9). Overall, 22 (10.5%) children had delayed development at 3 years. Total SBIS scores and individual domain scores did not differ between FGR and SGA groups at 3 or 6 years and similar proportions in each group had delayed development. Conclusion: Abnormal prenatal UA and ICA Doppler findings are not associated with lower developmental scores in low-birth-weight children delivered in the third trimester of pregnancy."
23287490,Artificial intelligence framework for simulating clinical decision-making: a Markov decision process approach,Casey C Bennett,"Objective: In the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding costs/complexity, the growing myriad of treatment options, and exploding information streams that often do not effectively reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose optimal treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to develop a general purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence (AI) framework to address these challenges. This framework serves two potential functions: (1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare policies, payment methodologies, etc., and (2) the basis for clinical artificial intelligence - an AI that can ""think like a doctor"". Methods: This approach combines Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical data and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential decision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic interactions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in partially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data) by maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an online agent that plans and re-plans as actions are performed and new observations are obtained. This framework was evaluated using real patient data from an electronic health record. Results: The results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach; such an AI framework easily outperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service models of healthcare. The cost per unit of outcome change (CPUC) was $189 vs. $497 for AI vs. TAU (where lower is considered optimal) - while at the same time the AI approach could obtain a 30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain AI model parameters could further enhance this advantage, obtaining approximately 50% more improvement (outcome change) for roughly half the costs. Conclusion: Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation framework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain environments. Future work is described that outlines potential lines of research and integration of machine learning algorithms for personalized medicine."
23283336,Individual differences in white matter diffusion affect sleep oscillations,Giovanni Piantoni,"The characteristic oscillations of the sleeping brain, spindles and slow waves, show trait-like, within-subject stability and a remarkable interindividual variability that correlates with functionally relevant measures such as memory performance and intelligence. Yet, the mechanisms underlying these interindividual differences are largely unknown. Spindles and slow waves are affected by the recent history of learning and neuronal activation, indicating sensitivity to changes in synaptic strength and thus to the connectivity of the neuronal network. Because the structural backbone of this network is formed by white matter tracts, we hypothesized that individual differences in spindles and slow waves depend on the white matter microstructure across a distributed network. We recorded both diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images and whole-night, high-density electroencephalography and investigated whether individual differences in sleep spindle and slow wave parameters were associated with diffusion tensor imaging metrics; white matter fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity were quantified using tract-based spatial statistics. Individuals with higher spindle power had higher axial diffusivity in the forceps minor, the anterior corpus callosum, fascicles in the temporal lobe, and the tracts within and surrounding the thalamus. Individuals with a steeper rising slope of the slow wave had higher axial diffusivity in the temporal fascicle and frontally located white matter tracts (forceps minor, anterior corpus callosum). These results indicate that the profiles of sleep oscillations reflect not only the dynamics of the neuronal network at the synaptic level, but also the localized microstructural properties of its structural backbone, the white matter tracts."
23279414,Emotional intelligence of pedodontics and preventive dentistry postgraduate students in India,D J Bhaskar,"Introduction: Whilst the corporate world seems to have embraced the concept of emotional intelligence (EI) as a predictor of worker success, its role in the dental profession needs to be explored; this study provides an Indian context. Hence, the EI of postgraduate (PG) students of Paedodontics and Preventive Dentistry was assessed. Aims: To measure EI amongst Paedodontics PG students in India, to assess any gender differences in EI and associated dimensions amongst them. Materials and methods: A total of 300 PG students from various dental institutions across India participating in their specialty national conference at I.T.S. Centre for Dental Studies and Research, Muradnagar, were included. EI was measured by the inventory developed by Singh (2004), based on Goleman's model (1998). Results: Overall, 240 questionnaires (80% response rate) were completed by 142 male and 98 female PG students and analysed. Results showed that 19% and 58% of the respondents had very high and high EI scores, respectively. None of the students had poor or very poor scores. Results indicated that both males and females had high EI scores of 230.4 (± 10.38) and 222.6 (± 12.04), respectively. However, males had higher scores for dimensions of self-awareness (P<0.01), social awareness (P<0.01) and social skills (P<0.001) than their female counterparts. Conclusions: Both male and female paedodontic postgraduate students in India had high EI scores. This study provides valuable baseline information on EI in an Indian context."
23278923,The COMT Val/Met polymorphism is associated with reading-related skills and consistent patterns of functional neural activation,Nicole Landi,"In both children and adults there is large variability in reading skill, with approximately 5-10% of individuals characterized as having reading disability; these individuals struggle to learn to read despite adequate intelligence and opportunity. Although it is well established that a substantial portion of this variability is attributed to the genetic differences between individuals, specifics of the connections between reading and the genome are not understood. This article presents data that suggest that variation in the COMT gene, which has previously been associated with variation in higher-order cognition, is associated with reading and reading-related skills, at the level of both brain and behavior. In particular, we found that the COMT Val/Met polymorphism at rs4680, which results in the substitution of the ancestral Valine (Val) by Methionine (Met), was associated with better performance on a number of critical reading measures and with patterns of functional neural activation that have been linked to better readers. We argue that this polymorphism, known for its broad effects on cognition, may modulate (likely through frontal lobe function) reading skill."
23278807,Predicting long-term growth in students' mathematics achievement: the unique contributions of motivation and cognitive strategies,Kou Murayama,"This research examined how motivation (perceived control, intrinsic motivation, and extrinsic motivation), cognitive learning strategies (deep and surface strategies), and intelligence jointly predict long-term growth in students' mathematics achievement over 5 years. Using longitudinal data from six annual waves (Grades 5 through 10; Mage = 11.7 years at baseline; N = 3,530), latent growth curve modeling was employed to analyze growth in achievement. Results showed that the initial level of achievement was strongly related to intelligence, with motivation and cognitive strategies explaining additional variance. In contrast, intelligence had no relation with the growth of achievement over years, whereas motivation and learning strategies were predictors of growth. These findings highlight the importance of motivation and learning strategies in facilitating adolescents' development of mathematical competencies."
23278393,Public health intelligence and the detection of potential pandemics,Martin French,"This article considers contemporary developments in public health intelligence (PHI), especially their focus on health events of pandemic potential. It argues that the sociological study of PHI can yield important insights for the sociology of pandemics. PHI aims to detect health events as (or even before) they unfold. Whilst its apparatuses envelope traditional public health activities, such as epidemiological surveillance, they increasingly extend to non-traditional public health activities such as data-mining in electronically mediated social networks. With a focus on non-traditional PHI activities, the article first situates the study of PHI in relation to the sociology of public health. It then discusses the conceptualisation and actualisation of pandemics, reflecting on how public health professionals and organisations must equip themselves with diverse allies in order to realise the claims they make about pandemic phenomena. Finally, using the analytic tools of actor-network theory, sites for future empirical research that can contribute to the sociology of pandemics are suggested."
23277023,"A potential ""tuning"" role for the outer hair cells in children with language disorders",Alfredo Durand-Rivera,"The cochlear outer hair cells serve a tuning function, and any dysfunction of their electromotile response can be reflected in language disorders. Otoacoustic emissions can be used to determine any dysfunction of these cells. A set of clinical records was established to register the neurological and auditory functioning in 42 children, followed by assessment with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), the Initial Language Test (ILT), the Auditory and Phonetic Discrimination Evaluation (APDE), tests for measuring Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential (BAEP) and Transient Otoacoustic Emissions (TOAE). Subjects were classified into 3 groups in this study: Control (C; n = 20), Syntactic Phonological Disorder (SPD; n = 17), and those with Phonological Disability (PD; n = 5). BAEP studies showed a clear response when all children were stimulated to 20 dB. TOAE responses displayed clear and significant differences with half-octave band reproducibility for both ears, the largest effect being observed in the right ear. The results that were compared using ANOVA tests, showed that cochlear processing affects the brain language function, playing a critical role in the language phonetic process."
23276271,Accuracy and consensus in judgments of trustworthiness from faces: behavioral and neural correlates,Nicholas O Rule,"Perceivers' inferences about individuals based on their faces often show high interrater consensus and can even accurately predict behavior in some domains. Here we investigated the consensus and accuracy of judgments of trustworthiness. In Study 1, we showed that the type of photo judged makes a significant difference for whether an individual is judged as trustworthy. In Study 2, we found that inferences of trustworthiness made from the faces of corporate criminals did not differ from inferences made from the faces of noncriminal executives. In Study 3, we found that judgments of trustworthiness did not differ between the faces of military criminals and the faces of military heroes. In Study 4, we tempted undergraduates to cheat on a test. Although we found that judgments of intelligence from the students' faces were related to students' scores on the test and that judgments of students' extraversion were correlated with self-reported extraversion, there was no relationship between judgments of trustworthiness from the students' faces and students' cheating behavior. Finally, in Study 5, we examined the neural correlates of the accuracy of judgments of trustworthiness from faces. Replicating previous research, we found that perceptions of trustworthiness from the faces in Study 4 corresponded to participants' amygdala response. However, we found no relationship between the amygdala response and the targets' actual cheating behavior. These data suggest that judgments of trustworthiness may not be accurate but, rather, reflect subjective impressions for which people show high agreement."
23276220,Effect of repetition lag on priming of unfamiliar visual objects in young and older adults,Leamarie T Gordon,"Across three experiments, we examined the effect of repetition lag on priming of unfamiliar visual objects in healthy young and older adults. Multiple levels of lag were examined, ranging from short (one to four intervening stimuli) to long (50 + intervening stimuli). In each experiment, subjects viewed a series of new and repeated line drawings of objects and decided whether they depicted structurally possible or impossible figures. Experiment 1 and 2 found similar levels of priming in young and older adults at short and medium lags. At the longer repetition lags (∼20 + intervening stimuli), older adults showed less overall priming, as measured by reaction time (RT) facilitation, than young adults. This indicates that older adults can rapidly encode unfamiliar three-dimensional objects to support priming at shorter lags; however, they cannot maintain these representations over longer intervals. In addition to repetition lag, we also explored the relationship between priming and cognitive reserve, as measured by education and verbal intelligence. In the older adults, higher levels of cognitive reserve were associated with greater RT priming, suggesting that cognitive reserve may mediate the relationship between aging and priming."
26462528,Honey Bees Inspired Optimization Method: The Bees Algorithm,Baris Yuce,"Optimization algorithms are search methods where the goal is to find an optimal solution to a problem, in order to satisfy one or more objective functions, possibly subject to a set of constraints. Studies of social animals and social insects have resulted in a number of computational models of swarm intelligence. Within these swarms their collective behavior is usually very complex. The collective behavior of a swarm of social organisms emerges from the behaviors of the individuals of that swarm. Researchers have developed computational optimization methods based on biology such as Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Ant Colony. The aim of this paper is to describe an optimization algorithm called the Bees Algorithm, inspired from the natural foraging behavior of honey bees, to find the optimal solution. The algorithm performs both an exploitative neighborhood search combined with random explorative search. In this paper, after an explanation of the natural foraging behavior of honey bees, the basic Bees Algorithm and its improved versions are described and are implemented in order to optimize several benchmark functions, and the results are compared with those obtained with different optimization algorithms. The results show that the Bees Algorithm offering some advantage over other optimization methods according to the nature of the problem."
26172250,How to Make a Young Child Smarter: Evidence From the Database of Raising Intelligence,John Protzko,"Can interventions meaningfully increase intelligence? If so, how? The Database of Raising Intelligence is a continuously updated compendium of randomized controlled trials that were designed to increase intelligence. In this article, the authors examine nearly every available intervention involving children from birth to kindergarten, using meta-analytic procedures when more than 3 studies tested similar methods and reviewing interventions when too few were available for meta-analysis. This yielded 4 meta-analyses on the effects of dietary supplementation to pregnant mothers and neonates, early educational interventions, interactive reading, and sending a child to preschool. All 4 meta-analyses yielded significant results: Supplementing infants with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, enrolling children in early educational interventions, reading to children in an interactive manner, and sending children to preschool all raise the intelligence of young children."
26069507,Intelligent system design for bionanorobots in drug delivery,Mark Fletcher,"A nanorobot is defined as any smart structure which is capable of actuation, sensing, manipulation, intelligence, and swarm behavior at the nanoscale. In this study, we designed an intelligent system using fuzzy logic for diagnosis and treatment of tumors inside the human body using bionanorobots. We utilize fuzzy logic and a combination of thermal, magnetic, optical, and chemical nanosensors to interpret the uncertainty associated with the sensory information. Two different fuzzy logic structures, for diagnosis (Mamdani structure) and for cure (Takagi-Sugeno structure), were developed to efficiently identify the tumors and treat them through delivery of effective dosages of a drug. Validation of the designed system with simulated conditions proved that the drug delivery of bionanorobots was robust to reasonable noise that may occur in the bionanorobot sensors during navigation, diagnosis, and curing of the cancer cells. Bionanorobots represent a great hope for successful cancer therapy in the near future."
25923392,"Translation, adaptation, and preliminary validation of the Brazilian version of the Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI-01)",Gisele da Silva Baraldi,"Introduction: Children with atypical development often present behavior problems that impair their psychosocial adaptation. Objective: To describe the cultural adaptation to Brazilian Portuguese of the Behavior Problems Inventory (BPI-01), as well as preliminary indicators of instrument reliability and validity. Methods: The process involved translation, back-translation, and cultural adaptation of the instrument. Psychometric properties (reliability and validity) were assessed comparing scores obtained with the BPI-01, the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children and Adults, the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 6-18 (CBCL/6-18), and the Autism Screening Questionnaire (ASQ). The sample comprised 60 children (30 typically developing and 30 atypically developing). Results: The cultural adaptation process was considered adequate. Internal consistency of the BPI-01 was satisfactory, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.65 for the self-injurious behavior scale, 0.82 for stereotyped behaviors, and 0.91 for aggressive/destructive behaviors. Considering a mean frequency of 0.5, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed 80% sensitivity and 3% specificity in the stereotyped behavior scale, 50 and 10% in aggressive/destructive behaviors, and 76 and 6% in self-injurious behaviors, respectively. Low-to-moderate correlations were observed between BPI-01, ASQ, and CBCL/6-18 scores. Conclusion: BPI-01 showed good psychometric properties, with satisfactory preliminary indicators of reliability, convergent validity, and sensitivity for the diagnosis of atypical development."
25649222,An Analytical Model / Emotional Intelligence Quotient and QOL in Mothers with Infants in Japan,Junko Ohashi,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the emotional intelligence quotient and health-related quality of life using structural equation modeling. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted among 1,911 mothers who visited the Health Center for an infant medical examination. A hypothetical model was constructed using variables of the emotional intelligence quotient, social support, coping, parenting stress, and perceived health competence. Result: There were a total of 1,104 valid responses (57.8%). Significant standardized estimates were obtained, confirming the goodness of fit issues with the model. The emotional intelligence quotient had a strong impact on physical and psychological quality of life, and showed the greatest association with coping. This study differed from previous studies in that, due to the inclusion of social support and explanatory variables in coping, an increase in coping strategies was more highly associated with emotional intelligence quotient levels than with social support. Conclusion: An enhanced emotional intelligence quotient should be considered a primary objective to promote the health of mothers with infant children."
25228484,The role of Emotional Intelligence in mental health and Type D personality among young adults,Paul Branscum,"The concept of Emotional Intelligence (EI) was developed as a way to evaluate and highlight the importance of emotional health as it relates to overall quality of life. This study examines the predictive nature of EI with standardized measures of mental health to create a model that can be utilized to create more effective health promotion interventions. Step-wise multiple regression was used to predict mental health (Kessler K-6 scale) and Type D personality (Denollett's Scale of Negative Affectivity and Social Inhibition) with five dimensions of EI. The results revealed that while not all of the dimensions of EI regressed significantly in each model, mood management was highly predictive of all mental health measures under investigation. Cut-off points for each scale were also helpful in interpreting the relatedness of EI to mental health."
25206008,Home based neuropsychological rehabilitation in severe traumatic brain injury: a case report,Manju Mohanty,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is the most common cause of death and disability in young people. The patients with TBI often suffer impairments in psycho motor speed, memory, attention, speed of information processing, executive functioning, fluid intelligence, language and visuo-spatial skills. These impairments need to be addressed as these have a significant impact on their social and occupational functioning. Neuropsychological rehabilitation has been found to be useful in improving cognitive and day to day functioning. It focuses on the improvement of basic abilities which in turn enhance cognitive functioning. The aim of the present study was to develop a home based neuropsychological rehabilitation programme and examine its usefulness in severe TBI. A single case study method was adopted. A detailed assessment was done at 1½ months (pre-assessment) and 9 months (post-intervention) to evaluate the changes. Post-intervention improvement was observed in her cognitive functions and day to day functioning. She had resumed her previous job also. Home based neuropsychological rehabilitation emerged to be useful in brain damaged patients."
25026762,Levels of emotional intelligence and types of attachment among third year students of the Faculty of Health Science and the Faculty of Medicine--a comparative analysis],Monika Tyszkiewicz-Bandur,"Introduction: For the purposes of this research attachment theory was incorporated into the concept of emotional intelligence. Material and method: The methodological starting point of this study was the assumption that the level of emotional intelligence and social competence is related to a steady feature, namely the type of attachment. Standardized questionnaires available in the Laboratory of Psychological Tests of the Polish Psychological Association were chosen to measure the level of emotional intelligence. However, the type of attachment was studied by Bartholomew's Self Description Test in my own translation. The study involved two groups of students, who were compared: 147 people from the Faculty of Health Sciences/Faculty of Nursing (nursing, midwifery, health promotion, cosmetology, emergency medicine, dietetics), and 181 people from the Faculty of Medicine (medicine), students in their second and third years of studies. A total of 328 people, aged 19-24, were tested. Results: On the basis of the results it was stated that students of the Faculty of Health Sciences/Faculty of Nursing, as compared to students of the Faculty of Medicine, received significantly higher scores on the scale of the social competence scale, which investigated the efficiency of their behaviour in intimate situations. Moreover, statistical analysis proved that students of the Faculty of Health Sciences showed significantly higher scores than those studying at the Faculty of Medicine in the following fields: KKS-I subscale assessing social competencies in--conditioning effective behaviour in intimate situations, emotional intelligence measured with the INTE questionnaire,--awareness of their own emotional states and understanding their causes (DINEMO-I),--ability to recognize emotions in other people and understanding the reasons for the reactions expressed by them (DINEMO-Others)--emotional intelligence measured with the DINEMO questionnaire (DINEMO-general score). Women from both faculties showed higher social competence than men in the KKS-I, and higher emotional intelligence according to the INTE questionnaire and DINEMO: the overall result, DINEMO-Others and DINEMO-I (in the last scale, at level 0.065). Male students, from both faculties, showed significantly higher social competence in conditioning effectiveness of behaviour in situations requiring assertiveness (KKS-A). Conclusion: Taking into consideration the results of this study, the answer to the question of whether it is reasonable and necessary to develop skills among the examined students seems to be obvious. Indeed, assertive behaviours should be trained for at the Faculty of Health Sciences. At the same time skills related to EI--such as perceiving and processing emotional information, awareness of one's own and others' emotions, and associated social competencies in conditioning effective behaviours in intimate situations--should be trained for at the Faculty of Medicine."
24837342,Recognition memory for faces and scenes,Wataru Sato,"Previous studies have suggested that face memory is unique; however, evidence is inconclusive. To further explore this issue, we investigated recognition memory for unfamiliar faces and scenes. Participants (n = 123) intentionally memorized the stimuli and then engaged in recognition tests. Recognition was measured following short (20 minutes) and long (3 weeks) retention intervals. Encoding strategies and intelligence were also measured. Recognition memory performance for faces was higher than that for scenes at both short and long intervals; however, the effect of retention interval was different between faces and scenes. A relationship between encoding strategies and memory performance was found for scenes but not for faces. The relationship between intelligence and memory performance also differed between faces and scenes. These results suggest that memory for faces is more robust and uses different cognitive mechanisms than memory for scenes."

""Delivering Geospatial Intelligence to Health Care Professionals (CHICA-GIS)"" (1R01LM010923-01) expands the medical application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) by integrating a geographic information system with CHICA. To provide knowledge management support for CHICA-GIS, three informationists at the Indiana University School of Medicine were awarded a supplement from the National Library Medicine. The informationists will enhance CHICA-GIS by: improving the accuracy and accessibility of information, managing and mapping the knowledge which undergirds the CHICA-GIS decision support tool, supporting community engagement and consumer health information outreach, and facilitating the dissemination of new CHICA-GIS research results and services."
24627784,A novel pseudoderivative-based mutation operator for real-coded adaptive genetic algorithms,Maxinder S Kanwal,"Recent development of large databases, especially those in genetics and proteomics, is pushing the development of novel computational algorithms that implement rapid and accurate search strategies. One successful approach has been to use artificial intelligence and methods, including pattern recognition (e.g. neural networks) and optimization techniques (e.g. genetic algorithms). The focus of this paper is on optimizing the design of genetic algorithms by using an adaptive mutation rate that is derived from comparing the fitness values of successive generations. We propose a novel pseudoderivative-based mutation rate operator designed to allow a genetic algorithm to escape local optima and successfully continue to the global optimum. Once proven successful, this algorithm can be implemented to solve real problems in neurology and bioinformatics. As a first step towards this goal, we tested our algorithm on two 3-dimensional surfaces with multiple local optima, but only one global optimum, as well as on the N-queens problem, an applied problem in which the function that maps the curve is implicit. For all tests, the adaptive mutation rate allowed the genetic algorithm to find the global optimal solution, performing significantly better than other search methods, including genetic algorithms that implement fixed mutation rates."
23274119,Significance of tuber size for complications of tuberous sclerosis complex,I Pascual-Castroviejo,"Introduction: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is one of the most frequent neurocutaneous disorders. Cortical tubers are the most common pathological changes in TSC and they are directly related to the disease's main clinical manifestations: seizures, mental retardation, and autistic behaviour. Objective: The aim of this study is to establish a correlation between tuber size and the severity of clinical features in TSC. Material and methods: We performed a retrospective study of the clinical and imaging findings from 45 TSC patients (22 females and 23 males) and compared the clinical features with the location, size, and number of the cortical tubers in each patient. Results: Four patients had voluminous tubers located in 1 or both cerebral hemispheres. All of these patients had intractable seizures and severe mental retardation; 3 of these cases also presented with autistic behaviour, despite tubers having been resected in all 4 patients. Thirteen patients had tubers of large-to-average size, and all patients in this group showed intractable seizures and mental retardation. Nine patients who had experienced infantile spasms during the first year of life presented autistic behaviour. Multiple tubers of small to average size were found in 28 patients. In general, this group had seizures that responded well to antiepileptic drugs and a low prevalence of autism. In 3 patients who all presented good seizure control and normal intelligence, single cortical/subcortical tubers were located in the frontal or occipital lobes. Of the total of 45 patients, 13 had cerebellar as well as cerebral tubers; these were generally present in cases with more severe clinical features. Conclusions: Although large tubers are less common than small to medium-sized ones, they are much more likely to be accompanied by severe clinical symptoms (seizures, mental retardation and autistic behaviour), even when the smaller tubers are quite numerous."
23273628,Reducing unnecessary lab testing in the ICU with artificial intelligence,F Cismondi,"Objectives: To reduce unnecessary lab testing by predicting when a proposed future lab test is likely to contribute information gain and thereby influence clinical management in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Recent studies have demonstrated that frequent laboratory testing does not necessarily relate to better outcomes. Design: Data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification were performed and an artificial intelligence tool, fuzzy modeling, was used to identify lab tests that do not contribute an information gain. There were 11 input variables in total. Ten of these were derived from bedside monitor trends heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, temperature, blood pressure, and urine collections, as well as infusion products and transfusions. The final input variable was a previous value from one of the eight lab tests being predicted: calcium, PTT, hematocrit, fibrinogen, lactate, platelets, INR and hemoglobin. The outcome for each test was a binary framework defining whether a test result contributed information gain or not. Patients: Predictive modeling was applied to recognize unnecessary lab tests in a real world ICU database extract comprising 746 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Main results: Classification accuracy of necessary and unnecessary lab tests of greater than 80% was achieved for all eight lab tests. Sensitivity and specificity were satisfactory for all the outcomes. An average reduction of 50% of the lab tests was obtained. This is an improvement from previously reported similar studies with average performance 37% by [1-3]. Conclusions: Reducing frequent lab testing and the potential clinical and financial implications are an important issue in intensive care. In this work we present an artificial intelligence method to predict the benefit of proposed future laboratory tests. Using ICU data from 746 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, and eleven measurements, we demonstrate high accuracy in predicting the likely information to be gained from proposed future lab testing for eight common GI related lab tests. Future work will explore applications of this approach to a range of underlying medical conditions and laboratory tests."
23270973,"Intelligence, temperament, and personality are related to over- or under-reporting of affective symptoms by patients with euthymic mood disorder",Eun Young Kim,"Background: Many patients with mood disorders report subjective indicators of depression that are inconsistent with clinicians' objective ratings. This study used the self-report Beck Depressive Inventory (BDI) and the observer-rated Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) to evaluate the extent to which temperament, personality traits, and clinical characteristics accounted for discrepancies between self-reports and clinician ratings of depressive symptoms in patients experiencing the euthymic period of a mood disorder. Method: The sample consisted of 100 individuals with bipolar disorder (n=72) or major depressive disorder (n=28). The HAMD and Young Mania Rating Scale were administered, and participants completed the BDI and Barratt Impulsivity Scale. Intelligence was assessed with the Korean Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Patients completed the Temperament Evaluation of the Memphis, Pisa, Paris, and San Diego Autoquestionnaire and the NEO-Five-Factor Inventory. Results: The BDI and HAMD were significantly but modestly correlated with each other (r=0.319, p<0.001). Lower intelligence and a less conscientious personality were independent contributors to differences between Z-scores for the BDI and the HAMD. Higher impulsivity and a more anxious temperament were also observed in the group that self-reported more symptoms than were noted by clinicians. Limitations: Generalizability of results can be limited in ethnic difference. Conclusions: Subjective and objective assessments of the depressive symptoms of patients with mood disorders in a euthymic mood state are frequently discordant. Clinicians should consider the subjective aspects of depressive symptoms along with objective information about the influence of intelligence and personality on patients' self-reports."
23269767,Developing emotional intelligence ability in oncology nurses: a clinical rounds approach,Estelle Codier,"Purpose/objectives: To explore the feasibility and impact of an emotional intelligence ability development program on staff and patient care. Design: A mixed method, pre/post-test design. Setting: A tertiary care hospital in urban Honolulu, HI. Rounds took place on a 24-bed inpatient oncology unit. Sample: 33 RNs in an oncology unit. Methods: After collection of baseline data, the emotional intelligence rounds were conducted in an inpatient oncology nursing unit on all shifts during a 10-month period. Main research variables: Demographic information, emotional intelligence scores, data from rounds, chart reviews of emotional care documentation, and unit-wide satisfaction and safety data. Findings: The ability to identify emotions in self and others was demonstrated less frequently than expected in this population. The low test response rate prevented comparison of scores pre- and postintervention. Conclusions: The staff's 94% participation in rounds, the positive (100%) evaluation of rounds, and poststudy improvements in emotional care documentation and emotional care planning suggest a positive effect from the intervention. Additional research is recommended over a longer period of time to evaluate the impact emotional intelligence specifically has on the staff's identification of emotions. Because the intervention involved minimal time and resources, feasibility for continuation of the intervention poststudy was rated ""high"" by the research team. Implications for nursing: Research in other disciplines suggests that improvement in emotional intelligence ability in clinical staff nurses may improve retention, performance, and teamwork in nursing, which would be of particular significance in high-risk clinical practice environments. Knowledge translation: Few research studies have explored development of emotional intelligence abilities in clinical staff nurses. Evidence from this study suggests that interventions in the clinical environment may be used to develop emotional intelligence ability. Impact from such development may be used in the future to not only improve the quality of nursing care, but also potentially limit the negative effects of high-stress environments on nurses."
23269527,Regulatory administrative databases in FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research: convergence toward a unified database,Jeffrey K Smith,"Regulatory administrative database systems within the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) are essential to supporting its core mission, as a regulatory agency. Such systems are used within FDA to manage information and processes surrounding the processing, review, and tracking of investigational and marketed product submissions. This is an area of increasing interest in the pharmaceutical industry and has been a topic at trade association conferences (Buckley 2012). Such databases in CBER are complex, not for the type or relevance of the data to any particular scientific discipline but because of the variety of regulatory submission types and processes the systems support using the data. Commonalities among different data domains of CBER's regulatory administrative databases are discussed. These commonalities have evolved enough to constitute real database convergence and provide a valuable asset for business process intelligence. Balancing review workload across staff, exploring areas of risk in review capacity, process improvement, and presenting a clear and comprehensive landscape of review obligations are just some of the opportunities of such intelligence. This convergence has been occurring in the presence of usual forces that tend to drive information technology (IT) systems development toward separate stovepipes and data silos. CBER has achieved a significant level of convergence through a gradual process, using a clear goal, agreed upon development practices, and transparency of database objects, rather than through a single, discrete project or IT vendor solution. This approach offers a path forward for FDA systems toward a unified database."
23268362,Long-term outcome of hemispheric surgery at different ages in 61 epilepsy patients,Anita Althausen,"Objective: Hemispheric neurosurgery is an established treatment for severe epilepsy caused by extended unilateral brain pathology. However, it is still an unresolved question at which age surgery should best be performed. In light of decreasing plasticity and the cumulative impact of seizures and anticonvulsants on neurodevelopment, early surgery appears preferable. Methods: We retrospectively investigated the medical, cognitive-behavioural and psychosocial long-term outcome (follow-up: 9.4 years (1.1-19.4)) of hemispherectomy as a function of age at surgery (early: <7 years/intermediate: 7-16 years/late: >16 years) based on a structured postal survey in a large patient sample (N=61/81, return rate: 75%). Results: At follow-up, 45 (74%) patients were seizure free. Presurgical levels of intelligence were below average in most patients (79%) and postsurgical cognition largely resembled the presurgical capacities. Best seizure outcome was obtained for early surgery patients (90% seizure free). Patients with late surgery, however, exhibited higher presurgical and postsurgical intelligence and better psychosocial achievements. Binary logistic regression identified better presurgical intelligence and higher age at surgery as positive predictors of postsurgical intelligence. Lower presurgical intelligence and postsurgical seizure freedom predicted intellectual pre-post improvements. Conclusions: Our data confirm the efficacy and cognitive safety of hemispheric surgeries performed at different ages. Eligible older and high functioning patients can be perfect candidates. Presurgical intelligence serves as indicator of the functional integrity of the contralateral hemisphere, which mainly determines postsurgical cognition and psychosocial outcome. Seizure freedom promotes cognitive improvement. As many unknown factors determined age at surgery, our retrospective data neither question early surgeries nor suggest postponing surgery."
23267224,Commentary: Recommendations and remaining questions for health care leadership training programs,James K Stoller,"Effective leadership is critical for optimizing cost, access, and quality in health care. Creating a pipeline of effective health care leaders requires developing leadership competencies that differ from the usual criteria of clinical and scientific excellence by which physicians have traditionally been promoted to leadership positions. Specific competencies that differentiate effective leaders from average leaders, especially emotional intelligence and its component abilities, are essential for effective leadership.Adopting a long-standing practice from successful corporations, some health care institutions, medical societies, and business schools now offer leadership programs that address these differentiating leadership competencies. The author draws on experience with such programs through the Cleveland Clinic Academy to provide recommendations for health care leadership training and to identify unanswered questions about such programs.The author recommends that such training should be broadly available to all health care leadership communities (i.e., nurses, administrators, and physicians). A progressive curriculum, starting with foundational concepts and extending to coaching and feedback opportunities through experiential learning, recognizes the challenge of becoming an effective leader and the long time line needed to do so. Linking leadership courses to continuing medical education and to graduate credit opportunities is appealing to participants. Other recommendations focus on the importance of current leaders' involvement in nominating emerging leaders for participation, embedding leadership development discussions in faculty's professional reviews, and blending discussion of frameworks and theory with practical, experiential lessons. The author identifies questions about the benefits of formal health care leadership training that remain to be answered."
23266476,Psychometric intelligence and P3 of the event-related potentials studied with a 3-stimulus auditory oddball task,Eligiusz Wronka,"Relationship between psychometric intelligence measured with Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices (RAPM) and event-related potentials (ERP) was examined using 3-stimulus oddball task. Subjects who had scored higher on RAPM exhibited larger amplitude of P3a component. Additional analysis using the Standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (sLORETA) revealed that this effect corresponds with stronger activity within the frontal cortex and the cingulate gyrus. High intelligence can also be linked with greater P3b response and stronger activity within the parietal cortex and the posterior cingulate gyrus. It may be concluded that the processes related to the initial stage of attention engagement as indexed by P3a, as well as the later stimulus evaluation and classification reflected in P3b, are more intense in subjects scoring higher on RAPM. The quality of mental abilities can therefore be related to differences of the activity in frontal and parietal brain regions."
23263563,"On folivory, competition, and intelligence: generalisms, overgeneralizations, and models of primate evolution",Ken Sayers,"Considerations of primate behavioral evolution often proceed by assuming the ecological and competitive milieus of particular taxa via their relative exploitation of gross food types, such as fruits versus leaves. Although this ""fruit/leaf dichotomy"" has been repeatedly criticized, it continues to be implicitly invoked in discussions of primate socioecology and female social relationships and is explicitly invoked in models of brain evolution. An expanding literature suggests that such views have severely limited our knowledge of the social and ecological complexities of primate folivory. This paper examines the behavior of primate folivore-frugivores, with particular emphasis on gray langurs (traditionally, Semnopithecus entellus) within the broader context of evolutionary ecology. Although possessing morphological characteristics that have been associated with folivory and constrained activity patterns, gray langurs are known for remarkable plasticity in ecology and behavior. Their diets are generally quite broad and can be discussed in relation to Liem's Paradox, the odd coupling of anatomical feeding specializations with a generalist foraging strategy. Gray langurs, not coincidentally, inhabit arguably the widest range of habitats for a nonhuman primate, including high elevations in the Himalayas. They provide an excellent focal point for examining the assumptions and predictions of behavioral, socioecological, and cognitive evolutionary models. Contrary to the classical descriptions of the primate folivore, Himalayan and other gray langurs-and, in actuality, many leaf-eating primates-range widely, engage in resource competition (both of which have previously been noted for primate folivores), and solve ecological problems rivaling those of more frugivorous primates (which has rarely been argued for primate folivores). It is maintained that questions of primate folivore adaptation, temperate primate adaptation, and primate evolution more generally cannot be answered by the frequent approach of broad characterizations, categorization models, crude variables, weakly correlative evidence, and subjective definitions. As a corollary, many current avenues of study are inadequate for explaining primate adaptation. A true understanding of primate ecology can only be achieved through the use of mainstream evolutionary ecology and thorough linkage of both proximate and ultimate mechanisms."
23263176,Cognitive function and neurodevelopmental outcomes in HIV-infected Children older than 1 year of age randomized to early versus deferred antiretroviral therapy: the PREDICT neurodevelopmental study,Thanyawee Puthanakit,"Background: We previously reported similar AIDS-free survival at 3 years in children who were >1 year old initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) and randomized to early versus deferred ART in the Pediatric Randomized to Early versus Deferred Initiation in Cambodia and Thailand (PREDICT) study. We now report neurodevelopmental outcomes. Methods: Two hundred eighty-four HIV-infected Thai and Cambodian children aged 1-12 years with CD4 counts between 15% and 24% and no AIDS-defining illness were randomized to initiate ART at enrollment (""early,"" n = 139) or when CD4 count became <15% or a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) category C event developed (""deferred,"" n = 145). All underwent age-appropriate neurodevelopment testing including Beery Visual Motor Integration, Purdue Pegboard, Color Trails and Child Behavioral Checklist. Thai children (n = 170) also completed Wechsler Intelligence Scale (intelligence quotient) and Stanford Binet Memory test. We compared week 144 measures by randomized group and to HIV-uninfected children (n = 319). Results: At week 144, the median age was 9 years and 69 (48%) of the deferred arm children had initiated ART. The early arm had a higher CD4 (33% versus 24%, P < 0.001) and a greater percentage of children with viral suppression (91% versus 40%, P < 0.001). Neurodevelopmental scores did not differ by arm, and there were no differences in changes between arms across repeated assessments in time-varying multivariate models. HIV-infected children performed worse than uninfected children on intelligence quotient, Beery Visual Motor Integration, Binet memory and Child Behavioral Checklist. Conclusions: In HIV-infected children surviving beyond 1 year of age without ART, neurodevelopmental outcomes were similar with ART initiation at CD4 15%-24% versus <15%, but both groups performed worse than HIV-uninfected children. The window of opportunity for a positive effect of ART initiation on neurodevelopment may remain in infancy."
23260803,Evaluation of intelligence in an adolescent bariatric population,Thao-Ly T Phan,"Background: The use of bariatric surgery as treatment for morbid obesity in adolescents has nearly tripled in recent years. Intelligence is an important component to a patient's assent of surgery and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle. The objective of this study was to describe the intelligence testing performance of a cohort of adolescents seeking laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). Twenty-nine patients (93% female, 62% white) with a mean age of 16 years and mean body mass index (BMI) of 49 kg/m(2) were enrolled in an adolescent bariatric program in the United States. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis, evaluating patient intelligence at a single preoperative time point using the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV or Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV. Intelligence quotient (IQ) scores were analyzed descriptively and in relationship to patient anthropometric measurements and characteristics. Results: Mean IQ was average for age (95, SD 16), although 21% of patients had an IQ<80 and no patients had an IQ>120. There was no significant association between IQ and BMI, weight, or waist circumference. Mean IQ was lower in patients who had failed a grade compared with those who had not failed a grade (P<.01) and in patients whose parents had not graduated college compared with those whose parents had (P< .05). Conclusion: In our cohort of adolescents seeking LAGB, mean IQ was average for age, suggesting capability to understand the procedure and healthy lifestyle concepts. Patients who exhibit deficits in intellect prior to surgery may benefit from educational resources and clinician support tailored to their reasoning abilities."
23260469,Selective attention in an insect visual neuron,Steven D Wiederman,"Animals need attention to focus on one target amid alternative distracters. Dragonflies, for example, capture flies in swarms comprising prey and conspecifics, a feat that requires neurons to select one moving target from competing alternatives. Diverse evidence, from functional imaging and physiology to psychophysics, highlights the importance of such ""competitive selection"" in attention for vertebrates. Analogous mechanisms have been proposed in artificial intelligence and even in invertebrates, yet direct neural correlates of attention are scarce from all animal groups. Here, we demonstrate responses from an identified dragonfly visual neuron that perfectly match a model for competitive selection within limits of neuronal variability (r(2) = 0.83). Responses to individual targets moving at different locations within the receptive field differ in both magnitude and time course. However, responses to two simultaneous targets exclusively track those for one target alone rather than any combination of the pair. Irrespective of target size, contrast, or separation, this neuron selects one target from the pair and perfectly preserves the response, regardless of whether the ""winner"" is the stronger stimulus if presented alone. This neuron is amenable to electrophysiological recordings, providing neuroscientists with a new model system for studying selective attention."
23258569,Exploring the relationship between anxiety and insistence on sameness in autism spectrum disorders,Katherine Gotham,"Elevated anxiety symptoms are one of the most common forms of psychopathology to co-occur with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The purpose of this study was to explore the association between anxiety and ASD symptoms, particularly the degree to which the relationship is explained by insistence on sameness (IS) behaviors and/or cognitive ability. The sample included 1429 individuals aged 5:8-18:0 years who participated in the Simons Simplex Collection, a genetic consortium study of ASD. Child Behavior Checklist Anxiety Problems T-scores and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised ""IS"" item raw totals were treated as both categorical and continuous measures of anxiety and IS, respectively. Chronological age, verbal intelligence quotient (IQ), and a variety of ASD phenotype-related and other behavioral variables were assessed for potential association with anxiety and IS. Anxiety and IS continuous variables were minimally, although significantly, associated with each other and with chronological age and verbal IQ. Neither anxiety nor IS was associated with other core autism diagnostic scores. Anxiety was associated with a variety of other psychiatric and behavioral symptoms in ASD, including irritability, attention problems, and aggression, while IS was not. Anxiety and IS appear to function as distinct constructs, each with a wide range of expression in children with ASD across age and IQ levels. Thus, both variables could be of use in ASD behavioral research or in dimensional approaches to genetic exploration. Unlike IS, however, anxiety is related to non-ASD-specific behavioral symptoms."
23258108,Epidemiologic evidence of health effects from long-distance transit of chemical weapons fallout from bombing early in the 1991 Persian Gulf War,Robert W Haley,"Background: Military intelligence data published in a companion paper explain how chemical fallout from US and Coalition bombing of Iraqi chemical weapons facilities early in the air campaign transited long distance, triggering nerve agent alarms and exposing US troops. We report the findings of a population-based survey designed to test competing hypotheses on the impact on chronic Gulf War illness of nerve agent from early-war bombing versus post-war demolition. Methods: The US Military Health Survey performed computer-assisted telephone interviews of a stratified random sample of Gulf War-era veterans (n = 8,020). Early-war exposure was measured by having heard nerve agent alarms and post-war exposure, by the computer-generated plume from the Khamisiyah demolition. Gulf War illness was measured by two widely published case definitions. Results: The OR (95% CI) for the association of alarms with the Factor case definition was 4.13 (95% CI 2.51-6.80) compared with 1.21 (95% CI 0.86-1.69) for the Khamisiyah plume. There was a dose-related trend for the number of alarms (p(trend) < 0.001) but not for the number of days in the Khamisiyah plume (p(trend) = 0.17). Conclusions: Exposure to low-level sarin nerve agent in fallout from bombing early in the air campaign contributed more to chronic illness than post-war demolition."
23257977,Meteorological and intelligence evidence of long-distance transit of chemical weapons fallout from bombing early in the 1991 Persian Gulf War,James J Tuite,"Background: Coalition bombings on the night of 18-19 January 1991, early in the Gulf War, targeted the Iraqi chemical weapons infrastructure. On 19 January 1991, nerve agent alarms sounded within Coalition positions hundreds of kilometers to the south, and the trace presence of sarin vapor was identified by multiple technologies. Considering only surface dispersion of plumes from explosions, officials concluded that the absence of casualties around bombed sites precluded long-distance transit of debris to US troop positions to explain the alarms and detections. Consequently, they were discounted as false positives, and low-level nerve agent exposure early in the air war was disregarded in epidemiologic investigations of chronic illnesses. Intelligence data: Newly assembled evidence indicates that plumes from those nighttime bombings of Iraqi chemical facilities would have traversed the stable nocturnal boundary layer and penetrated the residual layer where they would be susceptible to rapid transit by supergeostrophic winds. This explanation is supported by plume height predictions, available weather charts, weather satellite images showing transit of a hot air mass, effects of solar mixing of atmospheric layers, and observations of a stationary weather front and thermal inversion in the region. Conclusions: Current evidence supports long-distance transit. Epidemiologic studies of chronic postwar illness should be reassessed using veterans' reports of hearing nerve agent alarms as the measure of exposure."
23254631,Neuropsychological signs of Alzheimer's disease 8 years prior to diagnosis,Nicole S Schmid,"We investigated the earliest neuropsychological changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by comparing the baseline performance of 29 individuals who subsequently developed AD within an average of 7.91 ± 2.70 years with 29 pairwise-matched individuals who remained cognitively healthy (NC). We hypothesized that subtle, qualitative changes in cognition precede clinical AD by several years, and therefore examined subjective as well as standard quantitative measures of cognition, in addition to subjective estimates of mood and medical status. Participants were selected from the 825 members of the longitudinal BASEL study (BAsel Study on the ELderly), all of whom had been ApoE-genotyped and received comprehensive bi-annual neuropsychological assessments. Within 13 years, 29 were diagnosed with probable AD. Each individual who progressed to AD (AD-P) was pairwise matched to a NC participant based on age, education, demographic status, observation period, and, importantly, ApoE genotype. A regression analysis using the lasso technique identified which of 115 neuropsychological variables best discriminated baseline NC from baseline AD-P performance. This analysis yielded eleven neuropsychological variables that optimally discriminated the two groups (correct classification rate: 60.4%): 1) Intrusions and 2) response bias in verbal learning and memory tasks; 3) delayed figure recall; 4-6) three Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Block Design subtest variables; 7-8) number of errors and repetitions on letter fluency; and 9-11) self-report of memory problems, a feeling of sadness, and cardiac problems. These results suggest that the preclinical neuropsychological cascade to AD includes subtle but identifiable qualitative impairments in verbal and visual memory, visuospatial processing, error control, and subjective neuropsychological complaints."
23254452,Are age-related changes in cognitive function driven by age-related changes in sensory processing?,Larry E Humes,"Although there has been keen interest in the association among measures of sensory function and cognitive function for many years, in general, measures of sensory function have been confined to one or two senses and measures of threshold sensitivity (acuity). In this study, rigorous psychophysical measures of threshold sensitivity, temporal gap detection, temporal order identification, and temporal masking have been obtained, in hearing, vision, and touch. In addition, all subjects completed 15 subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition (WAIS-III). Data were obtained from 245 adults (18-87 years old) for the WAIS-III and for 40 measures of threshold sensitivity and temporal processing. The focus in this report is on individual differences in performance for the entire data set. Principal-components (PC) factor analysis reduced the 40 psychophysical measures to eight correlated factors, which were reduced further to a single global sensory processing factor. Similarly, PC factor analysis of the 15 WAIS-III scores resulted in three correlated factors that were further reduced to a single global cognitive function factor. Age, global sensory processing, and global cognitive function were all moderately and significantly correlated with one another. However, paired partial correlations, controlling for the third of these three measures, revealed that the moderate correlation between age and global cognitive function went to zero when global sensory processing was controlled for; the other two partial correlations remained intact. Structural models confirmed this result. These analyses suggest that the long-standing observation of age-related changes in cognitive function may be mediated by age-related changes in global sensory processing."
23253363,Benefits of training working memory in amnestic mild cognitive impairment: specific and transfer effects,Barbara Carretti,"Background: A growing number of studies are attempting to understand how effective cognitive interventions may be for patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), particularly in relation to their memory problems. Methods: The present study aimed to explore the benefits of a working memory (WM) training program in aMCI patients. Patients (N = 20) were randomly assigned to two training programs: the experimental group practiced with a verbal WM task, while the active control group conducted educational activities on memory. Results: Results showed that the aMCI patients completing the WM training obtained specific gains in the task trained with some transfer effects on other WM measures (visuospatial WM) and on processes involved in or related to WM, e.g. fluid intelligence (the Cattell test) and long-term memory. This was not the case for the aMCI control group, who experienced only a very limited improvement. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that WM training could be a valuable method for improving cognitive performance in aMCI patients, possibly delaying the onset of Alzheimer's disease."
23249814,Associations between TCF4 gene polymorphism and cognitive functions in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls,Xianghua Zhu,"The SNP rs2958182 was reported to be significantly associated with schizophrenia (SCZ) in Han Chinese. This study examined this SNP's associations with cognitive functions in 580 SCZ patients and 498 controls. Cognitive functions were assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-RC), the Attention Network Task (ANT), the Stroop task, the dot pattern expectancy (DPX), task and the N-back working memory task. Results showed significant or marginally significant interaction effects between genotype and diagnosis status on IQ (P=0.011) and attention-related tasks (ie, the forward digit span of WAIS-RC, P=0.005; the ANT conflict effect; P=0.020, and its ratios over mean reaction time (RT), P=0.036; the Stroop conflict effect, P=0.032, and its ratios over mean RT, P=0.062; and the DPX task's error rate under the BX condition, P<0.001, and the error rate of BX minus the error rate of AY (BX-AY), P=0.002). There were no such interaction effects on the measures of working memory (all P-values >0.05). Further analysis of the significant genotype-by-diagnosis interactions showed that the risk (T) allele was associated with better performance on cognitive tasks in patients but with worse performance in controls. These results seem to indicate that the association between this SNP and selected cognitive functions may be of an inverted U-shaped pattern. Future research is needed to replicate these results and to explore the biochemical mechanisms behind this association."
23249782,Sensorineural hearing loss and language development following neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation,Desiree van den Hondel,"Objectives: To determine the prevalence of hearing loss in school-age children who have undergone neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment and to identify any effects of hearing loss on speech- and language development [corrected] . Design: Prospective longitudinal follow-up study within the framework of a structured post-extracorporeal membrane oxygenation follow-up program. Setting: Outpatient clinic of a level III university hospital. Results: Tone audiometry was performed by standardized protocol in 136 children aged 5-12 yrs. Hearing loss was considered clinically significant when >20 dB. Hearing was normal in 75.7% of children. Five children (3.7%) had bilateral sensorineural or combined hearing loss; three of them received special audiological care (2.2% of total sample). Of the 24 children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, 19 (79.2%) had normal hearing and only two (8.3%) had mild sensorineural hearing loss, unilateral in one of them. Follow-up at 24 months of age had shown normal verbal and nonverbal developmental scores. Language development and intelligence median (range) scores at 5 yrs of age were also normal: receptive language development 104 (55-133), syntactical development 104 (68-132), and lexical development 101 (50-141) for 89 children; intelligence quotient 104 (68-132) for 106 children. Scores did not differ among those with normal hearing, mild hearing loss, and moderate-to-severe hearing loss (p = 0.800, p = 0.639, p = 0.876, and p = 0.886, for the respective developmental tests). Conclusions: We found normal language development and intelligence in a cohort of neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survivors. The prevalence of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was in accordance with that of a larger series in the United States-which exceeds the prevalence in the normal population."
23247822,A systematic review of the tools available for predicting survival and managing patients with urothelial carcinomas of the bladder and of the upper tract in a curative setting,Sarah J Drouin,"Objectives: To identify the predictive tools which have emerged recently in the field of urothelial carcinomas. Materials and methods: We performed a thorough MEDLINE literature review using a combination of the following keywords: urothelial carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, predictive tools, predictive models and nomograms. We found 117 articles, but only the relevant reports were selected. Results: The majority of available tools are prediction models, particularly nomograms. These models combine good performance accuracy with ease of use. They appear to be more accurate than risk grouping or tree modeling and are more suitable for clinicians than artificial intelligence. The most recent nomograms have been designed to be used in daily clinical practice and are even available as computer or smartphone applications. They focus on pathological outcomes or more frequently on survival statistics or recurrence risk after surgery. They provide an accurate prediction of disease evolution and may help clinicians to choose the most appropriate treatment option. However, these prediction tools still need to be validated and regularly utilized. Conclusion: Predictive tools represent very helpful clinical decision-making aids but need to be validated in larger populations."
23247749,Phoneme discrimination and dyslexia. Is the correlation gender-specific?],M Brunner,"Amongst pediatric phoniatry patients, the number of boys suspected of having dyslexia and/or an auditory processing disorder dominates over the number of girls. The aim of this study was to analyze whether there are different correlation patterns between phoneme discrimination and spelling ability in male and female children. Data from 253 children aged between 7 and 13 were analyzed retrospectively. Phoneme discrimination was assessed via the Heidelberg phoneme discrimination test and compared to the results of spelling and intelligence tests. We found a highly significant correlation between phoneme discrimination and spelling ability within the whole population (girls: r = 0.337; boys: r = 0.437) at an average IQ of 107. Results of the Heidelberg phoneme discrimination test were below the normal average value and showed no difference between the male and female populations. However, the correlation between phoneme discrimination and spelling ability was higher for the boys than for the girls. We conclude that female children are better able to compensate their deficits in speech processing than male children and perhaps employ other strategies for spelling."
23247523,Fuzzy-logic modeling of Fenton's strong chemical oxidation process treating three types of landfill leachates,Hanife Sari,"Three multiple input and multiple output-type fuzzy-logic-based models were developed as an artificial intelligence-based approach to model a novel integrated process (UF-IER-EDBM-FO) consisted of ultrafiltration (UF), ion exchange resins (IER), electrodialysis with bipolar membrane (EDBM), and Fenton's oxidation (FO) units treating young, middle-aged, and stabilized landfill leachates. The FO unit was considered as the key process for implementation of the proposed modeling scheme. Four input components such as H(2)O(2)/chemical oxygen demand ratio, H(2)O(2)/Fe(2+) ratio, reaction pH, and reaction time were fuzzified in a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system to predict the removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, color, and ammonia nitrogen. A total of 200 rules in the IF-THEN format were established within the framework of a graphical user interface for each fuzzy-logic model. The product (prod) and the center of gravity (centroid) methods were performed as the inference operator and defuzzification methods, respectively, for the proposed prognostic models. Fuzzy-logic predicted results were compared to the outputs of multiple regression models by means of various descriptive statistical indicators, and the proposed methodology was tested against the experimental data. The testing results clearly revealed that the proposed prognostic models showed a superior predictive performance with very high determination coefficients (R (2)) between 0.930 and 0.991. This study indicated a simple means of modeling and potential of a knowledge-based approach for capturing complicated inter-relationships in a highly non-linear problem. Clearly, it was shown that the proposed prognostic models provided a well-suited and cost-effective method to predict removal efficiencies of wastewater parameters prior to discharge to receiving streams."
23246789,Selling points: What cognitive abilities are tapped by casual video games?,Pauline L Baniqued,"The idea that video games or computer-based applications can improve cognitive function has led to a proliferation of programs claiming to ""train the brain."" However, there is often little scientific basis in the development of commercial training programs, and many research-based programs yield inconsistent or weak results. In this study, we sought to better understand the nature of cognitive abilities tapped by casual video games and thus reflect on their potential as a training tool. A moderately large sample of participants (n=209) played 20 web-based casual games and performed a battery of cognitive tasks. We used cognitive task analysis and multivariate statistical techniques to characterize the relationships between performance metrics. We validated the cognitive abilities measured in the task battery, examined a task analysis-based categorization of the casual games, and then characterized the relationship between game and task performance. We found that games categorized to tap working memory and reasoning were robustly related to performance on working memory and fluid intelligence tasks, with fluid intelligence best predicting scores on working memory and reasoning games. We discuss these results in the context of overlap in cognitive processes engaged by the cognitive tasks and casual games, and within the context of assessing near and far transfer. While this is not a training study, these findings provide a methodology to assess the validity of using certain games as training and assessment devices for specific cognitive abilities, and shed light on the mixed transfer results in the computer-based training literature. Moreover, the results can inform design of a more theoretically-driven and methodologically-sound cognitive training program."
23246616,Cognitive resources related to speech recognition with a competing talker in young and older listeners,H Meister,"Speech recognition in a multi-talker situation poses high demands on attentional and other central resources. This study examines the relationship between age, cognition and speech recognition in tasks that require selective or divided attention in a multi-talker setting. Two groups of normal-hearing adults (one younger and one older group) were asked to repeat utterances from either one or two concurrent speakers. Cognitive abilities were then inspected by neuropsychological tests. Speech recognition scores approached its ceiling and did not significantly differ between age groups for tasks that demanded selective attention. However, when divided attention was required, performance in older listeners was reduced as compared to the younger group. When selective attention was required, speech recognition was strongly related to working memory skills, as determined by a regression model. In comparison, speech recognition for tests requiring divided attention could be more strongly determined by neuropsychological probes of fluid intelligence. The findings of this study indicate that - apart from hearing impairment - cognitive aspects account for the typical difficulties of older listeners in a multi-speaker setting. Our results are discussed in the context of evidence showing that frontal lobe functions in terms of working memory and fluid intelligence generally decline with age."
23246381,DTI correlates of cognition in term children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy,Yogita Rai,"Background and aims: Presently, there is no published study that shows association between cognition and white matter injury in spastic cerebral palsy. We aimed to correlate cognitive functions with diffusion tensor imaging derived metrics in spastic diplegic children. Methods: Twenty-two term children with spastic diplegia and 22 healthy controls were recruited. All patients were graded on the basis of gross motor function. The Indian children intelligence Test was used to quantify cognition and diffusion tensor imaging was used to quantify microstructural changes in various white matter regions. Diffusion tensor imaging metrics were quantified by placing regions of interests in different white matter regions like corona radiata, anterior limb of internal capsule, posterior limb of internal capsule, mid brain, pons, medulla, genu, splenium, temporal white matter, parietal white matter, frontal white matter and occipital white matter. Results: Spastic diplegic children showed significantly lower neuropsychological test scores as compared to controls. A significantly decreased fractional anisotropy values were observed in corona radiata, anterior limb of internal capsule, posterior limb of internal capsule, mid brain, pons, medulla, genu, splenium and occipital white matter; however significantly increased mean diffusivity values were observed in corona radiata, anterior limb of internal capsule, posterior limb of internal capsule, mid brain, pons and genu in spastic diplegic as compared to controls. A significant positive correlation in fractional anisotropy and negative correlation in mean diffusivity was observed with neuropsychological test scores. Conclusion: These results suggest that these imaging metrics may be used as a biomarker of cognitive functions in term children with spastic diplegia."
23245284,Longitudinal investigation of adaptive functioning following conformal irradiation for pediatric craniopharyngioma and low-grade glioma,Kelli L Netson,"Purpose: Children treated for brain tumors with conformal radiation therapy experience preserved cognitive outcomes. Early evidence suggests that adaptive functions or independent-living skills may be spared. This longitudinal investigation prospectively examined intellectual and adaptive functioning during the first 5 years following irradiation for childhood craniopharyngioma and low-grade glioma (LGG). The effect of visual impairment on adaptive outcomes was investigated. Methods and materials: Children with craniopharyngioma (n=62) and LGG (n=77) were treated using conformal or intensity modulated radiation therapy. The median age was 8.05 years (3.21-17.64 years) and 8.09 years (2.20-19.27 years), respectively. Serial cognitive evaluations including measures of intelligence quotient (IQ) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) were conducted at preirradiation baseline, 6 months after treatment, and annually through 5 years. Five hundred eighty-eight evaluations were completed during the follow-up period. Results: Baseline assessment revealed no deficits in IQ and VABS indices for children with craniopharyngioma, with significant (P<.05) longitudinal decline in VABS Communication and Socialization indices. Clinical factors associated with more rapid decline included females and preirradiation chemotherapy (interferon). The only change in VABS Daily Living Skills correlated with IQ change (r=0.34; P=.01) in children with craniopharyngioma. Children with LGG performed below population norms (P<.05) at baseline on VABS Communication, Daily Living Indices, and the Adaptive Behavior Composite, with significant (P<.05) longitudinal decline limited to VABS Communication. Older age at irradiation was a protective factor against longitudinal decline. Severe visual impairment did not independently correlate with poorer adaptive outcomes for either tumor group. Conclusions: There was relative sparing of postirradiation functional outcomes over time in this sample. Baseline differences in functional abilities before the initiation of irradiation suggested that other factors influence functional outcomes above and beyond the effects of irradiation."
23245280,"Supratentorial ependymoma: disease control, complications, and functional outcomes after irradiation",Efrat Landau,"Purpose: Ependymoma is less commonly found in the supratentorial brain and has known clinical and molecular features that are unique. Our single-institution series provides valuable information about disease control for supratentorial ependymoma and the complications of supratentorial irradiation in children. Methods and materials: A total of 50 children with newly diagnosed supratentorial ependymoma were treated with adjuvant radiation therapy (RT); conformal methods were used in 36 after 1996. The median age at RT was 6.5 years (range, 1-18.9 years). The entire group was characterized according to sex (girls 27), race (white 43), extent of resection (gross-total 46), and tumor grade (anaplastic 28). The conformal RT group was prospectively evaluated for neurologic, endocrine, and cognitive effects. Results: With a median follow-up time of 9.1 years from the start of RT for survivors (range, 0.2-23.2 years), the 10-year progression-free and overall survival were 73% + 7% and 76% + 6%, respectively. None of the evaluated factors was prognostic for disease control. Local and distant failures were evenly divided among the 16 patients who experienced progression. Eleven patients died of disease, and 1 of central nervous system necrosis. Seizure disorders were present in 17 patients, and 4 were considered to be clinically disabled. Clinically significant cognitive effects were limited to children with difficult-to-control seizures. The average values for intelligence quotient and academic achievement (reading, spelling, and math) were within the range of normal through 10 years of follow-up. Central hypothyroidism was the most commonly treated endocrinopathy. Conclusion: RT may be administered with acceptable risks for complications in children with supratentorial ependymoma. These results suggest that outcomes for these children are improving and that complications may be limited by use of focal irradiation methods."
23244639,An alternative Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) factor structure of the WAIS-IV: age invariance of an alternative model for ages 70-90,Christopher R Niileksela,"The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale--Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) is by the far the most popular intelligence test for the assessment of adults in clinical and neuropsychological practice. Despite a number of studies examining the factor structure of the WAIS-IV from a Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) perspective (Benson, Hulac, & Kranzler, 2010; Ward, Bergman, & Hebert, 2012), a CHC interpretation of the WAIS-IV for individuals ages 70 and above has been absent from the literature. The exclusion of individuals ages 70 and above in previous research is likely due to the absence of several key supplemental subtests used to create a full CHC model. We provide an alternative five-factor CHC model of the WAIS-IV which includes only the subtests administered to individuals ages 70 and above in the standardization sample. Our results show (a) the alternative CHC model fits the data well; (b) this alternative CHC model met criteria for partial strict measurement invariance across the life span (only Similarities showed noninvariance) using strict criteria; (c) the five factors for ages 70-90 measure the same five CHC broad abilities identified in previous analyses reported for ages 16-69; and (d) the five-factor CHC solution for ages 70-90 is valid for the entire WAIS-IV age range and can be used whenever examiners administer the core battery but opt not to administer supplemental subtests."
23243117,Cognition and behavioural development in early childhood: the role of birth weight and postnatal growth,Cheng Huang,"Background: We evaluate the relative importance of birth weight and postnatal growth for cognition and behavioural development in 8389 Chinese children, 4-7 years of age. Method Weight was the only size measure available at birth. Weight, height, head circumference and intelligence quotient (IQ) were measured between 4 and 7 years of age. Z-scores of birth weight and postnatal conditional weight gain to 4-7 years, as well as height and head circumference at 4-7 years of age, were the exposure variables. Z-scores of weight at 4-7 years were regressed on birth weight Z-scores, and the residual was used as the measure of postnatal conditional weight gain. The outcomes were child's IQ, measured by the Chinese Wechsler Young Children Scale of Intelligence, as well as internalizing behavioural problems, externalizing behavioural problems and other behavioural problems, evaluated by the Child Behavior Checklist 4-18. Multivariate regressions were conducted to investigate the relationship of birth weight and postnatal growth variables with the outcomes, separately for preterm children and term children. Results: Both birth weight and postnatal weight gain were associated with IQ among term children; 1 unit increment in Z-score of birth weight (∼450 g) was associated with an increase of 1.60 [Confidence interval (CI): 1.18-2.02; P < 0.001] points in IQ, and 1 unit increment in conditional postnatal weight was associated with an increase of 0.46 (CI: 0.06-0.86; P = 0.02) points in IQ, after adjustment for confounders; similar patterns were observed when Z-scores of postnatal height and head circumference at age 4-7 years were used as alternative measurements of postnatal growth. Effect sizes of relationships with IQ were smaller than 0.1 of a standard deviation in all cases. Neither birth weight nor postnatal growth indicators were associated with behavioural outcomes among term children. In preterm children, neither birth weight nor postnatal growth measures were associated with IQ or behavioural outcomes. Conclusions: Both birth weight and postnatal growth were associated with IQ but not behavioural outcomes for Chinese term children aged 4-7 years, but the effect sizes were small. No relation between either birth weight or postnatal growth and cognition or behavioural outcomes was observed among preterm children aged 4-7 years."
23242760,A systematic analysis of genomic changes in Tg2576 mice,Lu Tan,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by intelligence decline, behavioral disorders and cognitive disability. The purpose of this study was to investigate gene expression in AD, based on published microarray data on Tg2576 mice. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Gene Ontology were employed to group genes together on the basis of their product characteristics and annotation data. Genes with prominent alterations were clustered into apoptosis and axon guidance pathways. Based on our findings and those of previous studies, we propose that the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway plays a crucial role in the neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction associated with AD. Furthermore, based on the findings of Positional Gene Enrichment analysis and Gene Set Enrichment analysis, we propose that the regulation of transcription of AD genes may be an important pathogenic factor in this neurodegenerative disease. Our results highlight the importance of genes that could subsequently be examined for their potential as prognostic markers for AD."
23240997,Global functional connectivity abnormalities in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders,Jeffrey R Wozniak,"Background: Previous studies, including those employing diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), have revealed significant disturbances in the white matter of individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Both macrostructural and microstructural abnormalities have been observed across levels of FASD severity. Emerging evidence suggests that these white matter abnormalities are associated with functional deficits. This study used resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to evaluate the status of network functional connectivity in children with FASD compared with control subjects. Methods: Participants included 24 children with FASD, ages 10 to 17, and 31 matched controls. Neurocognitive tests were administered including Wechsler Intelligence Scales, California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT), and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning. High-resolution anatomical MRI data and 6-minute resting-state fMRI data were collected. The resting-state fMRI data were subjected to a graph theory analysis, and 4 global measures of cortical network connectivity were computed: characteristic path length, mean clustering coefficient, local efficiency, and global efficiency. Results: Results revealed significantly altered network connectivity in those with FASD. The characteristic path length was 3.1% higher (p = 0.04, Cohen's d = 0.47), and global efficiency was 1.9% lower (p = 0.04, d = 0.63) in children with FASD compared with controls, suggesting decreased network capacity that may have implications for integrative cognitive functioning. Global efficiency was significantly positively correlated with cortical thickness in frontal (r = 0.38, p = 0.005), temporal (r = 0.28, p = 0.043), and parietal (r = 0.36, p = 0.008) regions. No relationship between facial dysmorphology and functional connectivity was observed. Exploratory correlations suggested that global efficiency and characteristic path length are associated with capacity for immediate verbal memory on the CVLT (r = 0.41, p = 0.05 and r = 0.41, p = 0.01, respectively) among those with FASD. Conclusions: Resting-state functional connectivity measures provide new insight into the integrity of brain networks in clinical populations such as FASD. Results demonstrate that children with FASD have alterations in core components of network function and that these aspects of brain integrity are related to measures of structure and cognitive functioning."
23239609,Behavior in preschool children with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,Petra Klaassen,"Children with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) are at an increased risk of psychiatric problems from pre-adolescence; little is known, however, about behavioral problems at a preschool age and the relationship between speech and behavior in this group. Parents of 90 children (aged 1.42-5.99 years) with 22q11DS filled out the Child Behavior Checklist, documenting behaviors including speech problems. Their profiles were compared with those of a comparison group consisting of 33 children with nonsyndromic orofacial clefts without 22q11DS, since both children with 22q11DS and children with clefts are expected to have speech problems. In the 22q11DS group, data on intelligence was acquired by means of formal tests. Parents of children with 22q11DS reported significantly higher mean scores on withdrawn behavior, affective problems and pervasive developmental problems compared to children with nonsyndromic clefts. Approximately 30% of children with 22q11DS had a score above the 97th percentile on at least one of the behavior subscales, indicating psychopathology. In children with 22q11DS, the reported behavioral problems were not associated with speech problems. Behavioral problems were found in 30% of young children with 22q11DS and were unlikely to be caused by speech problems. Within the 22q11DS group, behavioral problems were not related to the degree of cognitive impairment. This shows that many children with 22q11DS, known to be at an increased risk of psychiatric problems from pre-adolescence, already show behavioral problems before the age of 6 years."
23237024,Fronto-parietal white matter microstructural deficits are linked to performance IQ in a first-episode schizophrenia Han Chinese sample,Q Wang,"Background: Evidence shows that cognitive deficits and white matter (WM) dysconnectivity can independently be associated with clinical manifestations in schizophrenia. It is important to explore this triadic relationship in order to investigate whether the triplet could serve as potential extended endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Method: Diffusion tensor images and clinical performances were evaluated in 122 individuals with first-episode schizophrenia and 122 age- and gender-matched controls. In addition, 65 of 122 of the patient group and 40 of 122 controls were measured using intelligence quotient (IQ) testing. Results: The schizophrenia group showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) values than controls in the right cerebral frontal lobar sub-gyral (RFSG) WM. The schizophrenia group also showed a significant positive correlation between FA in the RFSG and performance IQ (PIQ) ; in turn, their PIQ score showed a significant negative correlation with negative syndromes. Conclusions: Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that WM deficits may be a core deficit that contributes to cognitive deficits as well as to negative symptoms."
23235994,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia with(out) ECMO: impaired development at 8 years,Marlous J Madderom,"Objective: To evaluate developmental and social-emotional outcomes at 8 years of age for children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), treated with or without neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) between January 1999 and December 2003. Design: Cohort study with structural prospective follow-up. Setting: Level III University Hospital. Patients: 35 children (ECMO: n=16; non-ECMO: n=19) were assessed at 8 years of age. Interventions: None. Main outcome measures: Intelligence and motor function. Concentration, behaviour, school performance, competence and health status were also analysed. Results: Mean (SD) intelligence for the ECMO group was 91.7 (19.5) versus 111.6 (20.9) for the non-ECMO group (p=0.015). Motor problems were apparent in 16% of all participants and differed significantly from the norm (p=0.015) without differences between treatment groups. For all participants, problems with concentration (68%, p<0.001) and with behavioural attention (33%, p=0.021) occurred more frequently than in reference groups, with no difference between treatment groups. School performance and competence were not affected. Conclusions: Children with CDH-whether or not treated with neonatal ECMO-are at risk for long-term morbidity especially in the areas of motor function and concentration. Despite their impairment, children with CDH have a well-developed feeling of self-competence."
23232546,An intelligent digital microfluidic system with fuzzy-enhanced feedback for multi-droplet manipulation,Jie Gao,"The complexity of droplet hydrodynamics on a digital microfluidic (DMF) system eventually weakens its potential for application in large-scale chemical/biological micro-reactors. We describe here an intelligent DMF technology to address that intricacy. A wide variety of control-engaged droplet manageability is proposed and demonstrated through the operation of our modular DMF prototype, which comprises: (i) rigid profiling ability of different droplet's hydrodynamics under a real-time trajectory track of droplet-derived capacitance, permitting accurate and autonomous multi-droplet positioning without visual setup and heavy image signal processing; (ii) fuzzy-enhanced controllability saving up to 21% charging time when compared with the classical approach, enhancing the throughput, fidelity and lifetime of the DMF chip, while identifying and renouncing those weakened electrodes deteriorated over time, and (iii) expert manipulability of multi-droplet routings under countermeasure decisions in real time, preventing droplet-to-droplet or task-to-task interference. Altogether, this work exhibits the first modular DMF system with built-in electronic-control software-defined intelligence to enhance the fidelity and reliability of each droplet operation, allowing future manufacturability of a wide range of life science analyses and combinatorial chemical screening applications."
23231531,Investment and intellect: a review and meta-analysis,Sophie von Stumm,"Cognitive or intellectual investment theories propose that the development of intelligence is partially influenced by personality traits, in particular by so-called investment traits that determine when, where, and how people invest their time and effort in their intellect. This investment, in turn, is thought to contribute to individual differences in cognitive growth and the accumulation of knowledge across the life span. We reviewed the psychological literature and identified 34 trait constructs and corresponding scales that refer to intellectual investment. The dispositional constructs were further classified into 8 related trait categories that span the construct space of intellectual investment. Subsequently, we sought to estimate the association between the identified investment traits and indicators of adult intellect, including measures of crystallized intelligence, academic performance (e.g., grade point average), college entry tests, and acquired knowledge. A meta-analysis of 112 studies with 236 coefficients and an overall sample of 60,097 participants indicated that investment traits were mostly positively associated with adult intellect markers. Meta-analytic coefficients ranged considerably, from 0 to .58, with an average estimate of .30. We concluded that investment traits are overall positively related to adult intellect; the strength of investment-intellect associations differs across trait scales and markers of intellect; and investment traits have a diverse, multifaceted nature. The meta-analysis also identified areas of inquiry that are currently lacking in empirical research. Limitations, implications, and future directions are discussed."
23231364,Developing doctoral scientists for drug discovery: pluridimensional education required,David R Janero,"Research universities continue to produce new scientists capable of generating knowledge with the potential to inform disease etiology and treatment. Mounting interest of doctoral-level experimental science students in therapeutics-related research careers is discordant with the widespread lack of direct drug-discovery and development experience, let alone commercialization success, among university faculty and administrators. Likewise, the archetypical publication- and grant-fueled, principal investigator (PI)-focused academic system (""PI-stan"") risks commoditization of science students pursuing their doctorates as a labor source, rendering them ill-prepared for career options related to therapeutics innovation by marginalizing their development of ""beyond-the-bench"" professional skills foundational to modern drug-discovery campaigns and career fluency. To militate against professionalization deficits in doctoral drug-discovery researchers, the author--a scientist-administrator-consultant with decades of discovery research and development (R&D), business, and educator experience in commercial and university settings--posits a critical need for pluridimensionality in graduate education and mentorship that extends well beyond thesis-related scientific domains/laboratory techniques to instill transferable operational-intelligence, project/people-management, and communication competencies. Specific initiatives are advocated to help enhance the doctoral science student's market competitiveness, adaptability, and navigation of the significant research, commercial, and occupational challenges associated with contemporary preclinical drug-discovery R&D."
23230066,Effects of iron supplementation of LBW infants on cognition and behavior at 3 years,Staffan K Berglund,"Objective: Low birth weight (LBW) infants are at increased risk of cognitive and behavioral problems and at risk for iron deficiency, which is associated with impaired neurodevelopment. We hypothesized that iron supplementation of LBW infants would improve cognitive scores and reduce behavioral problems. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, 285 marginally LBW (2000-2500 g) infants received 0, 1, or 2 mg/kg/day of iron supplements from 6 weeks to 6 months of age. At 3.5 years of age, these infants and 95 normal birth weight controls were assessed with a psychometric test (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence) and a questionnaire of behavioral problems (Child Behavior Checklist; CBCL). Results: There were no significant differences in IQ between the LBW groups or LBW infants versus controls. Mean (SD) full-scale IQ was 105.2 (14.5), 104.2 (14.7), and 104.5 (12.7) in the placebo, 1 mg, and 2 mg groups, respectively (P = .924). However, for behavioral problems, there was a significant effect of intervention. The prevalence of children with CBCL scores above the US subclinical cutoff was 12.7%, 2.9%, and 2.7% in the placebo, 1-mg, and 2-mg groups, respectively (P = .027), compared with 3.2% in controls. Relative risk (95% confidence interval) for CBCL score above cutoff in placebo-treated children versus supplemented was 4.5 (1.4-14.2). Conclusions: Early iron supplementation of marginally LBW infants does not affect cognitive functions at 3.5 years of age but significantly reduces the prevalence of behavioral problems. The study suggests a causal relation between infant iron deficiency and later behavioral problems."
23230008,Subjective quality of life of people with intellectual disabilities: the role of emotional competence on their subjective well-being,Lourdes Rey,"Background: For decades, the field of quality of life for people with intellectual disabilities has focused on the improving the external life conditions. However, scarce research has examined the contribution of person-related psychological resources such as emotional competence (EC) on well-being in this population. Materials and methods: Using a cross-sectional design, 139 adults with intellectual disabilities completed different measures: Subjective Happiness Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale and Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale. Results: Emotional competence shows a positive and significant association with life satisfaction and happiness. EC dimensions were predictors of well-being beyond socio-demographic variables and dispositional affectivity. Conclusions: Our findings provide preliminary evidence of the potential value of considering EC in the improvement in the quality of life of people with intellectual disabilities. Professionals interested in intellectual disabilities care might consider training programmes based on EC as an additional intervention strategy aimed at improving well-being."
23222751,Mentoring frontline managers: the vital force in stimulating innovation at the point of care,Laurie Shiparski,"Frontline managers in health care are the keepers of culture, the gateway to evoking a grass roots intelligence network, and they hold a pivotal role in advancing innovation at the point of care. Their roles are ever expanding and include knowledge and skills in managing the business, leading the people, and advancing their own leadership development. In all 3 areas, the impact of their leadership exponentially increases if they maximize innovative thinking and action. Health care executives need to establish the expectations for an innovative culture and the role of frontline managers. They must model the behaviors they promote and take the time to develop these frontline managers who are the hub for innovative success in the organization. This article offers insights and practical applications while exploring the innovation keystones of the following: creating an organizational culture of innovation, igniting collaboration that fuels diverse thinking and creativity, utilizing meaningful data to drive innovative decisions, and assessing and monitoring the ongoing climate and outcomes of innovation."
23221020,The emotionally intelligent decision maker: emotion-understanding ability reduces the effect of incidental anxiety on risk taking,Jeremy A Yip,"In two experiments, we examined how a core dimension of emotional intelligence, emotion-understanding ability, facilitates decision making. Individuals with higher levels of emotion-understanding ability can correctly identify which events caused their emotions and, in particular, whether their emotions stem from events that are unrelated to current decisions. We predicted that incidental feelings of anxiety, which are unrelated to current decisions, would reduce risk taking more strongly among individuals with lower rather than higher levels of emotion-understanding ability. The results of Experiment 1 confirmed this prediction. In Experiment 2, the effect of incidental anxiety on risk taking among participants with lower emotion-understanding ability, relative to participants with higher emotion-understanding ability, was eliminated when we informed participants about the source of their anxiety. This finding reveals that emotion-understanding ability guards against the biasing effects of incidental anxiety by helping individuals determine that such anxiety is irrelevant to current decisions."
23220453,Risk factors for spatial memory impairment in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy,Jana Amlerova,"At present, the risk factors for world-centered (allocentric) navigation impairment in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) are not known. There is some evidence on the importance of the right hippocampus but other clinical features have not been investigated yet. In this study, we used an experimental human equivalent to the Morris water maze to examine spatial navigation performance in patients with drug-refractory unilateral TLE. We included 47 left-hemisphere speech dominant patients (25 right sided; 22 left sided). The aim of our study was to identify clinical and demographic characteristics of TLE patients who performed poorly in allocentric spatial memory tests. Our results demonstrate that poor spatial navigation is significantly associated with younger age at epilepsy onset, longer disease duration, and lower intelligence level. Allocentric navigation in TLE patients was impaired irrespective of epilepsy lateralization. Good and poor navigators did not differ in their age, gender, or preoperative/postoperative status. This study provides evidence on risk factors that increase the likelihood of allocentric navigation impairment in TLE patients. The results indicate that not only temporal lobe dysfunction itself but also low general cognitive abilities may contribute to the navigation impairment."
23220223,The effects of Kiaa0319 knockdown on cortical and subcortical anatomy in male rats,Caitlin E Szalkowski,"Developmental dyslexia is a disorder characterized by a specific deficit in reading despite adequate overall intelligence and educational resources. The neurological substrate underlying these significant behavioral impairments is not known. Studies of post mortem brain tissue from male and female dyslexic individuals revealed focal disruptions of neuronal migration concentrated in the left hemisphere, along with aberrant symmetry of the right and left the planum temporale, and changes in cell size distribution within the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (Galaburda et al., 1985; Humphreys et al., 1990). More recent neuroimaging studies have identified several changes in the brains of dyslexic individuals, including regional changes in gray matter, changes in white matter, and changes in patterns of functional activation. In a further effort to elucidate the etiology of dyslexia, epidemiological and genetic studies have identified several candidate dyslexia susceptibility genes. Some recent work has investigated associations between some of these genetic variants and structural changes in the brain. Variants of one candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene, KIAA0319, have been linked to morphological changes in the cerebellum and functional activational changes in the superior temporal sulcus (Jamadar et al., 2011; Pinel et al., 2012). Animal models have been used to create a knockdown of Kiaa0319 (the rodent homolog of the human gene) via in utero RNA interference in order to study the gene's effects on brain development and behavior. Studies using this animal model have demonstrated that knocking down the gene leads to focal disruptions of neuronal migration in the form of ectopias and heterotopias, similar to those observed in the brains of human dyslexics. However, further changes to the structure of the brain have not been studied following this genetic disruption. The current study sought to determine the effects of embryonic Kiaa0319 knockdown on volume of the cortex and hippocampus, as well as midsagittal area of the corpus callosum in male rats. Results demonstrate that Kiaa0319 knockdown did not change the volume of the cortex or hippocampus, but did result in a significant reduction in the midsagittal area of the corpus callosum. Taken in the context of previous reports of behavioral deficits following Kiaa0319 knockdown (Szalkowski et al., 2012), and reports that reductions of corpus callosum size are related to processing deficits in humans (Paul, 2011), these results suggest that Kiaa0319 has a specific involvement in neural systems important for temporal processing."
23218132,Fullerton Virtual Twin Study: an update,Nancy L Segal,"Virtual twins (VTs) are same-age unrelated siblings reared together from early infancy. These unique sibling sets replicate twinship, but without the genetic link. The first VT pair was identified and studied at the University of Minnesota in 1990, launching the development of the Fullerton Virtual Twin Study at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) in 1991. The registry currently includes 151 pairs, mostly children, with new pairs identified on a continuous basis. Research with VTs includes studies of general intelligence, body size, interpersonal trust, social coordination, social networks, and parenting. In some cases, VTs have been studied in conjunction with pairs of monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, full siblings, and friends as part of TAPS (Twins, Adoptees, Peers and Siblings), a collaborative project conducted between CSUF and the University of San Francisco, 2002-2006. VTs will also serve as a comparison group for epigenetic analyses of young Chinese twins reared apart and together."
23216381,Is lower IQ in children with epilepsy due to lower parental IQ? A controlled comparison study,Natalie M Walker,"Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between parent and child Full-scale IQ (FSIQ) in children with epilepsy and in typically developing comparison children and to examine parent-child IQ differences by epilepsy characteristics. Method: The study participants were 97 children (50 males, 47 females; age range 8-18y; mean age 12y 3mo, SD 3y1mo) with recent-onset epilepsy including idiopathic generalized (n=43) and idiopathic localization-related epilepsies (n=54); 69 healthy comparison children (38 females, 31 males; age range 8-18y; mean age 12y 8mo, SD 3y 2mo), and one biological parent per child. All participants were administered the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). FSIQ was compared in children with epilepsy and typically developing children; FSIQ was compared in the parents of typically developing children and the parents of participants with epilepsy; parent-child FSIQ differences were compared between the groups. Results: FSIQ was lower in children with epilepsy than in comparison children (p<0.001). FSIQ of parents of children with epilepsy did not differ from the FSIQ of the parents of typically developing children. Children with epilepsy had significantly lower FSIQ than their parents (p<0.001), whereas comparison children did not. The parent-child IQ difference was significantly higher in the group with epilepsy than the comparison group (p=0.043). Epilepsy characteristics were not related to parent-child IQ difference. Interpretation: Parent-child IQ difference appears to be a marker of epilepsy impact independent of familial IQ, epilepsy syndrome, and clinical seizure features. This marker is evident early in the course of idiopathic epilepsies and can be tracked over time."
23216255,Re-examination of the Rey Word Recognition Test,Tiffanie L Bell-Sprinkel,"The Rey Word Recognition Test, a brief and simple to administer free-standing neurocognitive performance validity test, was examined in a large known-groups sample (122 credible patients and 134 non-credible patients). Total correctly recognized was the most sensitive score, identifying 54% of non-credible participants using a cut-off of ≤6, while maintaining specificity of approximately 90%. However, specifically rates were somewhat lower in credible individuals with <12 years of education or borderline intelligence, or who were bilingual (spoke English as a second language, or learned English concurrently with another language), indicating that cut-offs may require minor adjustment in these groups. Sensitivity rates were much higher in non-credible female versus male mild traumatic brain injury patients (mTBI; 68% versus 48% for total correct), suggesting that the Rey Word Recognition Test is particularly effective in identifying performance invalidity in female mTBI compensation seekers."
23207970,"Perceptual processing during trauma, priming and the development of intrusive memories",Oliver Sündermann,"Background: Intrusive reexperiencing in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly triggered by stimuli with perceptual similarity to those present during the trauma. Information processing theories suggest that perceptual processing during the trauma and enhanced perceptual priming contribute to the easy triggering of intrusive memories by these cues. Methods: Healthy volunteers (N = 51) watched neutral and trauma picture stories on a computer screen. Neutral objects that were unrelated to the content of the stories briefly appeared in the interval between the pictures. Dissociation and data-driven processing (as indicators of perceptual processing) and state anxiety during the stories were assessed with self-report questionnaires. After filler tasks, participants completed a blurred object identification task to assess priming and a recognition memory task. Intrusive memories were assessed with telephone interviews 2 weeks and 3 months later. Results: Neutral objects were more strongly primed if they occurred in the context of trauma stories than if they occurred during neutral stories, although the effect size was only moderate [Formula: see text] and only significant when trauma stories were presented first. Regardless of story order, enhanced perceptual priming predicted intrusive memories at 2-week follow-up (N = 51), but not at 3 months (n = 40). Data-driven processing, dissociation and anxiety increases during the trauma stories also predicted intrusive memories. Enhanced perceptual priming and data-driven processing were associated with lower verbal intelligence. Limitations: It is unclear to what extent these findings generalize to real-life traumatic events and whether they are specific to negative emotional events. Conclusions: The results provide some support for the role of perceptual processing and perceptual priming in reexperiencing symptoms."
23206328,A quantum theory for the irreplaceable role of docosahexaenoic acid in neural cell signalling throughout evolution,Michael A Crawford,"Six hundred million years ago, the fossil record displays the sudden appearance of intracellular detail and the 32 phyla. The ""Cambrian Explosion"" marks the onset of dominant aerobic life. Fossil intracellular structures are so similar to extant organisms that they were likely made with similar membrane lipids and proteins, which together provided for organisation and specialisation. While amino acids could be synthesised over 4 billion years ago, only oxidative metabolism allows for the synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids, thus producing novel lipid molecular species for specialised cell membranes. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) provided the core for the development of the photoreceptor, and conversion of photons into electricity stimulated the evolution of the nervous system and brain. Since then, DHA has been conserved as the principle acyl component of photoreceptor synaptic and neuronal signalling membranes in the cephalopods, fish, amphibian, reptiles, birds, mammals and humans. This extreme conservation in electrical signalling membranes despite great genomic change suggests it was DHA dictating to DNA rather than the generally accepted other way around. We offer a theoretical explanation based on the quantum mechanical properties of DHA for such extreme conservation. The unique molecular structure of DHA allows for quantum transfer and communication of π-electrons, which explains the precise depolarisation of retinal membranes and the cohesive, organised neural signalling which characterises higher intelligence."
23205844,"Understanding relationships between autism, intelligence, and epilepsy: a cross-disorder approach",Agnies M van Eeghen,"Aim: As relationships between autistic traits, epilepsy, and cognitive functioning remain poorly understood, these associations were explored in the biologically related disorders tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and epilepsy. Method: The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a quantitative measure of autistic traits, was distributed to caregivers or companions of patients with TSC, NF1, and childhood-onset epilepsy of unknown cause (EUC), and these results were compared with SRS data from individuals with idiopathic autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and their unaffected siblings. Scores and trait profiles of autistic features were compared with cognitive outcomes, epilepsy variables, and genotype. Results: A total of 180 SRS questionnaires were completed in the TSC, NF1, and EUC outpatient clinics at the Massachusetts General Hospital (90 females, 90 males; mean age 21 y, range 4-63 y), and SRS data from 210 patients with ASD recruited from an autism research collaboration (167 males, 43 females; mean age 9 y, range 4-22 y) and 130 unaffected siblings were available. Regression models showed a significant association between SRS scores and intelligence outcomes (p<0.001) and various seizure variables (p<0.02), but not with a specific underlying disorder or genotype. The level of autistic features was strongly associated with intelligence outcomes in patients with TSC and epilepsy (p<0.01); in patients with NF1 these relationships were weaker (p=0.25). For all study groups, autistic trait subdomains covaried with neurocognitive comorbidity, with endophenotypes similar to that of idiopathic autism. Interpretation: Our data show that in TSC and childhood-onset epilepsy, the severity and phenotype of autistic features are inextricably linked with intelligence and epilepsy outcomes. Such relationships were weaker for individuals with NF1. Findings suggest that ASDs are not specific in these conditions."
23202577,Sustainable management of a coupled groundwater-agriculture hydrosystem using multi-criteria simulation based optimisation,Jens Grundmann,"In this paper we present a new simulation-based integrated water management tool for sustainable water resources management in arid coastal environments. This tool delivers optimised groundwater withdrawal scenarios considering saltwater intrusion as a result of agricultural and municipal water abstraction. It also yields a substantially improved water use efficiency of irrigated agriculture. To allow for a robust and fast operation we unified process modelling with artificial intelligence tools and evolutionary optimisation techniques. The aquifer behaviour is represented using an artificial neural network (ANN) which emulates a numerical density-dependent groundwater flow model. The impact of agriculture is represented by stochastic crop water production functions (SCWPF). Simulation-based optimisation techniques together with the SCWPF and ANN deliver optimal groundwater abstraction and cropping patterns. To address contradicting objectives, e.g. profit-oriented agriculture vs. sustainable abstraction scenarios, we performed multi-objective optimisations using a multi-criteria optimisation algorithm."
23201156,The approximate number system and its relation to early math achievement: evidence from the preschool years,Justin W Bonny,"Humans rely on two main systems of quantification; one is nonsymbolic and involves approximate number representations (known as the approximate number system or ANS), and the other is symbolic and allows for exact calculations of number. Despite the pervasiveness of the ANS across development, recent studies with adolescents and school-aged children point to individual differences in the precision of these representations that, importantly, have been shown to relate to symbolic math competence even after controlling for general aspects of intelligence. Such findings suggest that the ANS, which humans share with nonhuman animals, interfaces specifically with a uniquely human system of formal mathematics. Other findings, however, point to a less straightforward picture, leaving open questions about the nature and ontogenetic origins of the relation between these two systems. Testing children across the preschool period, we found that ANS precision correlated with early math achievement but, critically, that this relation was nonlinear. More specifically, the correlation between ANS precision and math competence was stronger for children with lower math scores than for children with higher math scores. Taken together, our findings suggest that early-developing connections between the ANS and mathematics may be fundamentally discontinuous. Possible mechanisms underlying such nonlinearity are discussed."
23196431,Bilingualism and the increased attentional blink effect: evidence that the difference between bilinguals and monolinguals generalizes to different levels of second language proficiency,Vatsala Khare,"The attentional blink task involves rapid serial presentation of visual stimuli, two of which the participants have to report. The usual finding is that participants are impaired at reporting the second target if it appears in close temporal proximity to the first target. Previous research has shown that the effect is stronger in bilinguals than monolinguals. We investigated whether the difference between monolinguals and proficient bilinguals can be extended to bilinguals of different proficiency levels. Therefore, we replicated the paradigm in a large sample of Hindi-English bilinguals with different proficiency levels of English, as measured with a validated vocabulary test. We additionally measured the participants' intelligence with the raven progressive matrices. We found that the size of the attentional blink effect correlates with the degree of second language proficiency and not with the degree of intelligence. This indicates that research on executive control functions can be done with bilinguals of different proficiency levels. Our results are also in line with recent findings showing that the attentional blink effect is not primarily due to limited processing resources."
37869707,Recognition Memory for High and Low Associative Stimuli in Autistic Individuals with Outstanding Memory Skill,Nicola Neumann,"Background: Individuals with autism exhibit typical recognition memory performance, but they show a reduced use of context and relational processing in more complex memory tasks. It is unclear whether the same is true for autistic individuals with exceptional memory skill for whom superior rote memory skill has been assumed. Objective: In this study, we investigated recognition memory for high and low associative stimuli in autistic memory experts. In accord with the rote memory notion, we expected an equal recognition performance for high and low associative stimuli and superior memorizing of nonsense material compared to control participants. Method: Seven autistic memory experts and seven typically developed control subjects, matched according to age, sex, handedness, and full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ), were examined on a continuous old-new recognition paradigm, including high or low associative pseudowords and shapes. Memory expertise was characterized as a currently present outstanding memory skill above the subject's general level of ability and above the general population and was validated through direct clinical observation or some form of credible evidence. Results: Our hypotheses were partially corroborated with autistic memory experts recognizing high and low associative shapes equally well in contrast to control participants who showed superior recognition of high associative shapes. However, memory experts did not outperform control participants in the recognition of low associative shapes. There were no differences for the recognition of pseudowords. Conclusions: Findings do not indicate enhanced memory for nonsense material, but a failure to make use of semantic features of abstract stimuli as assumed for autism as a whole."
23192834,Executive functioning as a mediator of the relationship between premorbid verbal intelligence and health risk behaviors in a rural-dwelling cohort: a Project FRONTIER study,Chloe V Menon,"Limited research is available regarding the impact of neuropsychological functioning on health risk behaviors in rural-dwelling elderly populations. This cross-sectional study examined the relationships between estimated premorbid verbal IQ (AMNART), executive functioning impairment (EXIT25), and health risk behaviors including alcohol use (AUDIT), smoking, compliance with recommended cancer screenings, and obesity (BMI). The total sample included 456 English-speaking adults and older adults of non-Hispanic White and Hispanic origin seen as part of an ongoing study of rural cognitive aging, Project FRONTIER. Regression analyses revealed significant independent effects of AMNART and EXIT25 on most health risk behaviors, and supported the hypothesized mediating role of EXIT25 on the relationships between AMNART and smoking, cancer screenings, and BMI in both cognitively impaired and healthy subgroups. This study clarifies the relationships between executive functioning, premorbid IQ, and health risk behaviors in diverse groups, and confirms that premorbid IQ represents an important determinant of health behaviors and neurocognitive outcomes."
23188886,Barriers to success in parent training for young children with developmental delay: the role of cumulative risk,Daniel M Bagner,"The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of cumulative risk on dropout and treatment outcome in parent training. Participants were 44 families of young children (mean age of 49.59 months) who presented with elevated externalizing behavior problems and developmental delay or borderline developmental delay. All families were offered to receive Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), an evidence-based, behavioral parent-training intervention, at a hospital-based outpatient clinic. Cumulative risk was calculated as a sum of risk variables, including socioeconomic disadvantage (poverty, low maternal education), family structure (single-parent household), and maternal risk characteristics (minority status, lower intelligence, and parental distress). Families with higher cumulative risk scores, especially those with three or more risks, were more likely to drop out of treatment and display diminished treatment response in child behavior and parenting skills compared with families with lower cumulative risk scores. However, only two individual risk factors (i.e., minority status and family structure) predicted dropout, and one individual risk factor (i.e., maternal education) predicted outcome. These findings suggest that it can be useful to conceptualize risk factors as having a cumulative, in addition to individual, influence on parent-training interventions for children with developmental delay and have significant implications for clinical practice. It is important for clinicians to regularly assess for risk factors, and future research should examine ways in which clinicians can improve retention and outcome of parent training in the presence of multiple risk factors."
23186349,A fluid-filled soft robot that exhibits spontaneous switching among versatile spatiotemporal oscillatory patterns inspired by the true slime mold,Takuya Umedachi,"Behavioral diversity is an essential feature of living systems, enabling them to exhibit adaptive behavior in hostile and dynamically changing environments. However, traditional engineering approaches strive to avoid, or suppress, the behavioral diversity in artificial systems to achieve high performance in specific environments for given tasks. The goals of this research include understanding how living systems exhibit behavioral diversity and using these findings to build lifelike robots that exhibit truly adaptive behaviors. To this end, we have focused on one of the most primitive forms of intelligence concerning behavioral diversity, namely, a plasmodium of true slime mold. The plasmodium is a large amoeba-like unicellular organism that does not possess any nervous system or specialized organs. However, it exhibits versatile spatiotemporal oscillatory patterns and switches spontaneously between these. Inspired by the plasmodium, we built a mathematical model that exhibits versatile oscillatory patterns and spontaneously transitions between these patterns. This model demonstrates that, in contrast to coupled nonlinear oscillators with a well-designed complex diffusion network, physically interacting mechanosensory oscillators are capable of generating versatile oscillatory patterns without changing any parameters. Thus, the results are expected to shed new light on the design scheme for lifelike robots that exhibit amazingly versatile and adaptive behaviors."
23184588,Early executive function predicts reasoning development,Lindsey E Richland,"Analogical reasoning is a core cognitive skill that distinguishes humans from all other species and contributes to general fluid intelligence, creativity, and adaptive learning capacities. Yet its origins are not well understood. In the study reported here, we analyzed large-scale longitudinal data from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development to test predictors of growth in analogical-reasoning skill from third grade to adolescence. Our results suggest an integrative resolution to the theoretical debate regarding contributory factors arising from smaller-scale, cross-sectional experiments on analogy development. Children with greater executive-function skills (both composite and inhibitory control) and vocabulary knowledge in early elementary school displayed higher scores on a verbal analogies task at age 15 years, even after adjusting for key covariates. We posit that knowledge is a prerequisite to analogy performance, but strong executive-functioning resources during early childhood are related to long-term gains in fundamental reasoning skills."
23184506,Dual n-back training increases the capacity of the focus of attention,Lindsey Lilienthal,"Working memory (WM) training has been reported to benefit abilities as diverse as fluid intelligence (Jaeggi et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 105:6829-6833, 2008) and reading comprehension (Chein & Morrison, Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 17:193-199, 2010), but transfer is not always observed (for reviews, see Morrison & Chein, Psychonomics Bulletin & Review, 18:46-60, 2011; Shipstead et al., Psychological Bulletin, 138:628-654, 2012). In contrast, recent WM training studies have consistently reported improvement on the trained tasks. The basis for these training benefits has received little attention, however, and it is not known which WM components and/or processes are being improved. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to investigate five possible mechanisms underlying the effects of adaptive dual n-back training on working memory (i.e., improvements in executive attention, updating, and focus switching, as well as increases in the capacity of the focus of attention and short-term memory). In addition to a no-contact control group, the present study also included an active control group whose members received nonadaptive training on the same task. All three groups showed significant improvements on the n-back task from pretest to posttest, but adaptive training produced larger improvements than did nonadaptive training, which in turn produced larger improvements than simply retesting. Adaptive, but not nonadaptive, training also resulted in improvements on an untrained running span task that measured the capacity of the focus of attention. No other differential improvements were observed, suggesting that increases in the capacity of the focus of attention underlie the benefits of adaptive dual n-back training."
23183130,Nanopsychiatry--the potential role of nanotechnologies in the future of psychiatry: a systematic review,G Fond,"Nanomedicine is defined as the area using nanotechnology's concepts for the benefit of human beings' health and well being. In this article, we aimed to provide an overview of areas where nanotechnology is applied and how they could be extended to care for psychiatric illnesses. The main applications of nanotechnology in psychiatry are (i) pharmacology. There are two main difficulties in neuropharmacology: drugs have to pass the blood-brain barrier and then to be internalized by targeted cells. Nanoparticles could increase drugs bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, especially improving safety and efficacy of psychotropic drugs. Liposomes, nanosomes, nanoparticle polymers, nanobubbles are some examples of this targeted drug delivery. Nanotechnologies could also add new pharmacological properties, like nanoshells and dendrimers (ii) living analysis. Nanotechnology provides technical assistance to in vivo imaging or metabolome analysis (iii) central nervous system modeling. Research teams have succeeded to modelize inorganic synapses and mimick synaptic behavior, a step essential for further creation of artificial neural systems. Some nanoparticle assemblies present the same small worlds and free-scale networks architecture as cortical neural networks. Nanotechnologies and quantum physics could be used to create models of artificial intelligence and mental illnesses. We are not about to see a concrete application of nanomedicine in daily psychiatric practice. Even if nanotechnologies are promising, their safety is still inconsistent and this must be kept in mind. However, it seems essential that psychiatrists do not forsake this area of research the perspectives of which could be decisive in the field of mental illness."
23182876,Cardiac vagal reactivity during relived sadness is predicted by affect intensity and emotional intelligence,Joshua A Rash,"Background: The induction of one particular emotion - sadness - has shown two different profiles of autonomic nervous system (ANS) response that are characterized by activation, or withdrawal in cardiac parasympathetic activation. We tested whether individual differences in emotion expression predict cardiac vagal reactivity from baseline to autobiographical sadness induction. Methods: Respiration sinus arrhythmia (RSA(c)) was measured in 56 adults (28 men) asked to relive an episode of sadness. Participants completed an emotional intelligence (EI) test, and a measure of trait affect intensity. Results: Sadness resulted in cardiac vagal activation with concomitant increase in HR suggestive of parasympathetic and sympathetic co-activation. Individual differences were observed in autonomic reactivity during sadness. Higher scores on the affect intensity measure and the emotional intelligence test predicted greater change in RSA(c) during sadness and recovery. Conclusion: The tendency to experience affect intensely and the ability to perceive emotions predict adaptive physiological regulation during sadness."
23182870,"A review of impurity profiling and synthetic route of manufacture of methylamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine, amphetamine, dimethylamphetamine and p-methoxyamphetamine",Natasha Stojanovska,"Amphetamine-type substances (ATS), like other synthetically derived compounds, can be produced by a multitude of synthetic pathways using a variety of precursors and reagents, resulting in a large number of possible contaminants (by-products, intermediates and impurities). This review article describes the common contaminants found in preparations of methylamphetamine (MA), 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA), amphetamine (AP), N,N-dimethylamphetamine (DMA) and p-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) synthesised via common synthetic pathways including reductive amination, Leuckart method, Nagai method, Emde method, Birch reduction, ""Moscow"" method, Wacker process, ""Nitrostyrene"" method and the Peracid oxidation method. Contaminants can facilitate identification of the synthetic route, origin of precursors and may suggest information as to the location of manufacture of these illicit drugs. Contaminant profiling can provide vital intelligence for investigations in which linking seizures or identifying the synthetic pathway is essential. This review article presents an accessible resource; a compilation of contaminants resulting from a variety of manufacturing methods used to synthesise the most common ATS. It is important for research in this field to continue as valuable information can be extracted from illicit drug samples, increasing discrimination amongst ATS, and in turn, leading to an increase in evidential value and forensic drug intelligence from forensic drug samples."
23182381,Competition as rational action: why young children cannot appreciate competitive games,Beate Priewasser,"Understanding rational actions requires perspective taking both with respect to means and with respect to objectives. This study addresses the question of whether the two kinds of perspective taking develop simultaneously or in sequence. It is argued that evidence from competitive behavior is best suited for settling this issue. A total of 71 kindergarten children between 3 and 5 years of age participated in a competitive game of dice and were tested on two traditional false belief stories as well as on several control tasks (verbal intelligence, inhibitory control, and working memory). The frequency of competitive poaching moves in the game correlated with correct predictions of mistaken actions in the false belief task. Hierarchical linear regression after controlling for age and control variables showed that false belief understanding significantly predicted the amount of poaching moves. The results speak for an interrelated development of the capacity for ""instrumental"" and ""telic"" perspective taking. They are discussed in the light of teleology as opposed to theory use and simulation."
23179067,Karl Pearson and eugenics: personal opinions and scientific rigor,Darcie A P Delzell,"The influence of personal opinions and biases on scientific conclusions is a threat to the advancement of knowledge. Expertise and experience does not render one immune to this temptation. In this work, one of the founding fathers of statistics, Karl Pearson, is used as an illustration of how even the most talented among us can produce misleading results when inferences are made without caution or reference to potential bias and other analysis limitations. A study performed by Pearson on British Jewish schoolchildren is examined in light of ethical and professional statistical practice. The methodology used and inferences made by Pearson and his coauthor are sometimes questionable and offer insight into how Pearson's support of eugenics and his own British nationalism could have potentially influenced his often careless and far-fetched inferences. A short background into Pearson's work and beliefs is provided, along with an in-depth examination of the authors' overall experimental design and statistical practices. In addition, portions of the study regarding intelligence and tuberculosis are discussed in more detail, along with historical reactions to their work."
23177892,"Development and psychometric validation of the Brief Intellectual Disability Scale for use in low-health resource, high-burden countries",Priya Mammen,"Objective: To develop and validate a concise, parent-completed Brief Intellectual Disability Scale (BIDS) for children in low-disability resource and high-disability care burden countries. Study design and setting: In this prospective cross-sectional study of 124 children recruited from a facility for intellectual disability (ID), the newly developed BIDS as the measure for validation as well as for the gold standard and convergent and divergent validities was administered by independent raters. Tests for diagnostic accuracy, reproducibility, and validity were conducted at the item and scale levels. Results: The BIDS scores of ≥5 (sensitivity [Sn] = 71.43%, specificity [Sp] = 80.95%) and ≥11 (Sn = 4.29%, Sp = 100%), with area under the curve of 0.79, are suggested, respectively, for screening and diagnostic use in Indian populations. The inter-rater reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96) and test-retest reliability at 4 weeks (ICC = 0.95) for BIDS are strong. Besides the adequate face and content validities, BIDS demonstrates good internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.80) and item-total correlation. There is moderate convergent validity with Binet-Kamat Test of Intelligence or Gesell's Developmental Schedule (r = -0.66, P = 0.001) as well as with adaptive behavior measure of Vineland Social Maturity Scale (r =-0.52, P = 0.001) and low divergent validity with the subscales of Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity: Comprehensive Teacher Rating Scale ( r = -0.11, P = 0.7; r = 0.18, P = 0.5; r = 0.13, P = 0.6; r = 0.08, P = 0.7). An exploratory factor analysis demonstrated a three-factor structure, explaining 60% of variance. Conclusion: The BIDS shows promise as a psychometrically adequate, yet brief measure for identifying ID in countries with low disability care resources and high disability-related burden."
23177416,Artificial intelligence techniques for embryo and oocyte classification,Claudio Manna,"One of the most relevant aspects in assisted reproduction technology is the possibility of characterizing and identifying the most viable oocytes or embryos. In most cases, embryologists select them by visual examination and their evaluation is totally subjective. Recently, due to the rapid growth in the capacity to extract texture descriptors from a given image, a growing interest has been shown in the use of artificial intelligence methods for embryo or oocyte scoring/selection in IVF programmes. This work concentrates the efforts on the possible prediction of the quality of embryos and oocytes in order to improve the performance of assisted reproduction technology, starting from their images. The artificial intelligence system proposed in this work is based on a set of Levenberg-Marquardt neural networks trained using textural descriptors (the local binary patterns). The proposed system was tested on two data sets of 269 oocytes and 269 corresponding embryos from 104 women and compared with other machine learning methods already proposed in the past for similar classification problems. Although the results are only preliminary, they show an interesting classification performance. This technique may be of particular interest in those countries where legislation restricts embryo selection.

Although the results are only preliminary, they showed an interesting classification performance. This technique may be of particular interest in those countries where legislation restricts embryo selection."
23167587,The relation between age of attainment of motor milestones and future cognitive and motor development in Bangladeshi children,Jena Derakhshani Hamadani,"There is a need for easily administered, low-cost measures to assess child development in large field studies. Many researchers evaluate the age of attainment of motor milestones, but there is little information on their validity. A large longitudinal study (MINIMat) was conducted in a poor rural area of Bangladesh and we assessed the age of attainment of motor milestones in a subsample of over 2000 children. We examined their association with scores on the Bayley psychomotor development index (PDI) and mental development index (MDI) at 18 months and with scores on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children and with intelligence quotient (IQ) on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence at 64 months. A field worker visited the children's homes monthly from 3 to 12 months of age and then at 15 months and examined the children. Mothers recorded the date of attainment of the milestones. Age of attainment of walking and standing alone was moderately correlated with the PDI and had significant but low associations with later motor development. They were as good as the PDI in predicting later motor development and could be used in field studies for that purpose. Milestone age of attainment had significant but low correlations with MDI and later IQ. Height for age at 15 months was related to milestones and later IQ and motor development and accounted for some of the association between milestones and IQ. Milestone age of attainment may not be sensitive enough to be used as an indicator of later IQ."
23175613,"BioGPS and MyGene.info: organizing online, gene-centric information",Chunlei Wu,"Fast-evolving technologies have enabled researchers to easily generate data at genome scale, and using these technologies to compare biological states typically results in a list of candidate genes. Researchers are then faced with the daunting task of prioritizing these candidate genes for follow-up studies. There are hundreds, possibly even thousands, of web-based gene annotation resources available, but it quickly becomes impractical to manually access and review all of these sites for each gene in a candidate gene list. BioGPS (http://biogps.org) was created as a centralized gene portal for aggregating distributed gene annotation resources, emphasizing community extensibility and user customizability. BioGPS serves as a convenient tool for users to access known gene-centric resources, as well as a mechanism to discover new resources that were previously unknown to the user. This article describes updates to BioGPS made after its initial release in 2008. We summarize recent additions of features and data, as well as the robust user activity that underlies this community intelligence application. Finally, we describe MyGene.info (http://mygene.info) and related web services that provide programmatic access to BioGPS."
23175518,Breastfeeding and brain structure in adolescence,Salomi Kafouri,"Background: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate an association between duration of exclusive breastfeeding and structure of cortical regions implicated in general intelligence. Methods: We studied adolescents (n = 571; aged 12-18 years) participating in the Saguenay Youth Study; half of the participants were exposed to maternal cigarette smoking during pregnancy. Hierarchical linear modelling was used to assess whether breastfeeding is an important predictor of cortical thickness when other predictors, such as age, sex, parental education and exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy, are also considered. Target cortical regions were identified using a meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies of cognitive abilities relevant for general intelligence. Results: We found that duration of exclusive breastfeeding was associated with cortical thickness in the superior and inferior parietal lobules (t = 2.31, P = 0.02). We also replicated the association between breastfeeding and general intelligence (t = 2.69, P = 0.008). Conclusion: In this study, we showed that breastfeeding is associated with variations in the thickness of the parietal cortex in a community-based sample of adolescents. We also found association of breastfeeding duration with full scale and performance IQ, as observed previously."
23171327,Working memory performance of older adults with insomnia,Nicole Lovato,"Older individuals suffering insomnia typically report declines in their cognitive performance beyond what they consider to be normal changes due to the aging process. Recent neuro-imaging studies have demonstrated frontal lobe hypo-activation among insomniac populations when compared with healthy, good sleepers. However, research is yet to confirm whether frontal lobe hypo-activation translates into objective declines when performing tasks hypothesized to draw upon this brain region. This study aimed to investigate whether older insomnia sufferers demonstrate significantly impaired performance on a challenging working memory task when compared with age-matched good sleepers. Forty-nine older individuals (mean age = 69.43 years, SD = 4.83) suffering from sleep maintenance insomnia were compared with 49 age-matched good sleepers. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Double Span Memory Task, a computer-based working memory task that requires participants to indicate the names and/or spatial locations of increasingly longer sequences of visually presented objects. After controlling for general intelligence, the individuals suffering from insomnia did not perform differently when compared with the good sleepers on either the simpler or more cognitively demanding components of the task. Older individuals with insomnia did not display an observable impairment of working memory in this study relative to good sleepers. Despite the mixed results from previous research, this study adds weight to the absence of objective impairment in insomniacs, at least while performing short-term demanding cognitive tasks."
23171197,Measuring psychological development with the Rorschach,Michael L Stanfill,"The aim of this study was to develop and to provide an initial validation of a Rorschach index measuring developmental progress and growth. The Developmental Index (DI) was created in a 3-step, sequential strategy with adult and child data in which we (a) selected potential DI variables from quantitative research literature and from data available to us, (b) identified an optimal group of DI variables and created the DI equation using an independent nonpatient sample, and (c) provided an initial cross-validation of the DI using an independent clinical sample. Age and age rank categorization groups from normative data associated with the Wechsler intelligence scales (Wechsler, 2003, 2008) and contrasts between adults and children served as criteria for development. These samples include a large amount of data from a diverse international subject pool using the Comprehensive System of the Rorschach. Interim validity checks were undertaken to ensure the analytic strategy was sound. The DI includes 12 variables with individual weights determined by regression analysis. The initial independent cross-validation of the DI with a clinical sample revealed that it discriminated well between children and adults. Thus, initial support for this scale as a measure of psychological development across cultures and geography was established, but future research is needed. Clinical implications and specific research needs are presented."
23167265,To cut a short test even shorter: reliability and validity of a brief assessment of intellectual ability in schizophrenia--a control-case family study,Eva Velthorst,"Background: The potential inclusion of cognitive assessments in the DSM-V and large time-consuming assessments drive a need for short tests of cognitive impairments. We examined the reliability and validity of a brief, 15-minute, version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III). Methods: The sample consisted of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (n=75), their siblings without schizophrenia (n=74) and unrelated healthy controls (n=84). A short WAIS-III consists of the Digit Symbol Coding subtest, and every second (or third) item of Block Design, Information, and Arithmetic. Psychometric analyses were implemented using item-response theory (IRT) to determine the best minimal item short version, while maintaining the sensitivity and reliability of the IQ score. Results: The proposed 15-minute WAIS-III gave reliable estimates of the Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) in all three groups in the sample. The 15-minute (select-item) version yielded an overall R of.95 (R(2)=.92) and IRT yielded an R of .96 (R(2)=.92). All four subtests performed well in differentiating patients, relatives, and healthy controls. Multivariate analysis showed a significant difference in FSIQ-estimate between patients, relatives, and healthy controls, F(2, 202) = 19.00, p < .0001. Regression modelling showed that the three versions of the WAIS had similar associations with functional outcome after a 3-year follow-up. Conclusions: Our proposed 15-minute version of the WAIS may serve as a useful screening device for general intellectual ability in research or clinical settings, and is recommended when a quick and accurate IQ estimate is desired."
23165823,Depressive symptoms in late life and cerebrovascular disease: the importance of intelligence and lesion location,Alison D Murray,"Background: The influence of white matter lesions on depressive symptoms in healthy ageing populations remains unclear. In this study, we examined the relationship between depressive symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected cerebrovascular disease in a normal population living independently in the community, and measured the influence of location of brain abnormalities, fluid intelligence, living alone, and sex. Methods: Prospective cohort: 497 community dwelling individuals all born in 1936, who took part in the Scottish Mental Survey of 1947, were followed up in 2000 and at biannual intervals in a longitudinal study of health and cognitive aging. Two hundred forty-four volunteered for brain MRI in 2004-2006. Suitable data were available in 219/244, of whom 115 were men. Brain hyperintensities in lobar white matter, basal ganglia , periventricular, and infratentorial regions were measured using Scheltens' scale. Depressed mood was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) on three biannual intervals. Relationships between Scheltens' scores, HADS-D scores, fluid intelligence, living alone, and sex were assessed using general linear modeling. Results: The main predictor of depressive symptom scores was poorer fluid intelligence (partial η(2) =0.023-0.028, P < .05). Ischemic change in the brainstem (partial η(2) = 0.026, P ≤.05) and basal ganglia (partial η(2) =0.018, P ≤ .05) also predicted HADS-D scores. There was no relationship with sex or living alone. Conclusions: Hyperintensities in the brainstem and basal ganglia are associated with depressive symptoms. Higher fluid intelligence is associated with lower depressive symptoms in this normal, ageing population."
23164358,Can cognitive deficits facilitate differential diagnosis between at-risk mental state for psychosis and depressive disorders?,Carla Schulze,"Aim: Many studies have provided evidence of cognitive deficits in individuals in an 'At Risk Mental State' (ARMS) for psychosis, which makes neuropsychology potentially useful in the early detection of psychosis. As depression is an important differential diagnosis in prodromal states of psychosis, the specificity of neurocognitive deficits in ARMS individuals as compared with non-psychotic depressive disorders is investigated. Methods: Neurocognitive performance of four groups was analysed: 22 ARMS individuals with later transition to psychosis (ARMS-T), 25 ARMS individuals without later transition to psychosis (ARMS-NT), 34 controls with depressive disorders and 76 healthy controls. The subjects were assessed with a neurocognitive test battery covering the domains' intelligence, executive function and attention/ working memory. MANOVAs, ANOVAs and Tukey's tests were applied after adjustment for confounding factors. Results: ARMS-T showed significant cognitive deficits in working memory and in certain executive function tasks compared with healthy controls as well as with controls with depression. Controls with depression were only impaired in time per move in the tower of Hanoi test when compared with healthy controls. Conclusions: The psychosis prodrome seems to be associated with cognitive deficits in the domains of working memory and executive function. In contrast, depressive patients showed no cognitive deficits, but slowing in one executive function task. Neurocognitive testing might therefore contribute to the differential diagnosis between prodromal psychosis and depressive disorders."
23161259,Trail Making Test error analysis in classic motor neuron disease,Foteini Christidi,"The use of non-traditional scores in neuropsychological assessment allows for pattern analysis of test performance, commonly referred to as Quantified Process Approach (QPA). In the present study, the QPA was taken to study error rates on the Trail Making Test (TMT) in 26 non-demented patients with classic motor neuron disease (cMND), who commonly present with impaired cognitive flexibility, and 26 matched healthy controls. Between-group comparisons revealed that cMND patients exhibited higher total error rates on the TMT Part B (TMT-B) relative to controls (p < 0.001), though no significant associations were noted between TMT errors and measures of attention and executive function obtained using the Stroop Neuropsychological Screening Test, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Digit Symbol and Digit Span subtests and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Moreover, the percentage of cMND patients with normal TMT-B time-to-completion who committed at least one error (either sequential or perseverative errors) in TMT-B was significantly higher compared to controls (p = 0.005). These findings suggest that error analysis using the QPA may increase the clinical utility of TMT and should be considered in addition to time-to-completion scores, in the neuropsychological assessment of patients with cMND."
23157447,Neurocognitive consequences of a paediatric brain tumour and its treatment: a meta-analysis,Marieke A de Ruiter,"Aim: This meta-analysis provides a systematic review of studies into intellectual and attentional functioning of paediatric brain tumour survivors (PBTS) as assessed by two widely used measures: the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (3rd edition; WISC-III) and the Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Method: Studies were located that reported on performance of PBTS (age range 6-16y). Meta-analytic effect sizes were calculated for Full-scale IQ, Performance IQ, and Verbal IQ as measured by the WISC-III, and mean hit reaction time, errors of omission, and errors of commission as measured by the CPT. Exploratory analyses investigated the possible impacts of treatment mode, tumour location, age at diagnosis, and time since diagnosis on intelligence. Results: Twenty-nine studies were included: 22 reported on the WISC-III in 710 PBTS and seven on CPT results in 372 PBTS. PBTS performed below average (p(s) <0.001) on Full-scale IQ (Cohen's d=-0.79), Performance IQ (d=-0.90), and Verbal IQ (d=-0.54). PBTS committed more errors of omission than the norm (d=0.82, p<0.001); no differences were found for mean hit reaction time and errors of commission. Cranial radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and longer time since diagnosis were associated with lower WISC-III scores (p(s) <0.05). Interpretation: PBTS have seriously impaired intellectual functioning and attentiveness. Being treated with cranial radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy as well as longer time since diagnosis leads to worse intellectual functioning."
23150280,"Transient neonatal diabetes, ZFP57, and hypomethylation of multiple imprinted loci: a detailed follow-up",Susanne E Boonen,"Objective: Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus 1 (TNDM1) is the most common cause of diabetes presenting at birth. Approximately 5% of the cases are due to recessive ZFP57 mutations, causing hypomethylation at the TNDM locus and other imprinted loci (HIL). This has consequences for patient care because it has impact on the phenotype and recurrence risk for families. We have determined the genotype, phenotype, and epigenotype of the first 10 families to alert health professionals to this newly described genetic subgroup of diabetes. Research design and methods: The 10 families (14 homozygous/compound heterozygous individuals) with ZFP57 mutations were ascertained through TNDM1 diagnostic testing. ZFP57 was sequenced in probands and their relatives, and the methylation levels at multiple maternally and paternally imprinted loci were determined. Medical and family histories were obtained, and clinical examination was performed. Results: The key clinical features in probands were transient neonatal diabetes, intrauterine growth retardation, macroglossia, heart defects, and developmental delay. However, the finding of two homozygous relatives without diabetes and normal intelligence showed that the phenotype could be very variable. The epigenotype always included total loss of methylation at the TNDM1 locus and reproducible combinations of differential hypomethylation at other maternally imprinted loci, including tissue mosaicism. Conclusions: There is yet no clear genotype-epigenotype-phenotype correlation to explain the variable clinical presentation, and this results in difficulties predicting the prognosis of affected individuals. However, many cases have a more severe phenotype than seen in other causes of TNDM1. Further cases and global epigenetic testing are needed to clarify this."
23149900,"First all-in-one diagnostic tool for DNA intelligence: genome-wide inference of biogeographic ancestry, appearance, relatedness, and sex with the Identitas v1 Forensic Chip",Brendan Keating,"When a forensic DNA sample cannot be associated directly with a previously genotyped reference sample by standard short tandem repeat profiling, the investigation required for identifying perpetrators, victims, or missing persons can be both costly and time consuming. Here, we describe the outcome of a collaborative study using the Identitas Version 1 (v1) Forensic Chip, the first commercially available all-in-one tool dedicated to the concept of developing intelligence leads based on DNA. The chip allows parallel interrogation of 201,173 genome-wide autosomal, X-chromosomal, Y-chromosomal, and mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms for inference of biogeographic ancestry, appearance, relatedness, and sex. The first assessment of the chip's performance was carried out on 3,196 blinded DNA samples of varying quantities and qualities, covering a wide range of biogeographic origin and eye/hair coloration as well as variation in relatedness and sex. Overall, 95 % of the samples (N = 3,034) passed quality checks with an overall genotype call rate >90 % on variable numbers of available recorded trait information. Predictions of sex, direct match, and first to third degree relatedness were highly accurate. Chip-based predictions of biparental continental ancestry were on average ~94 % correct (further support provided by separately inferred patrilineal and matrilineal ancestry). Predictions of eye color were 85 % correct for brown and 70 % correct for blue eyes, and predictions of hair color were 72 % for brown, 63 % for blond, 58 % for black, and 48 % for red hair. From the 5 % of samples (N = 162) with <90 % call rate, 56 % yielded correct continental ancestry predictions while 7 % yielded sufficient genotypes to allow hair and eye color prediction. Our results demonstrate that the Identitas v1 Forensic Chip holds great promise for a wide range of applications including criminal investigations, missing person investigations, and for national security purposes."
23148935,Stability and change in intelligence from age 12 to age 52: results from the Luxembourg MAGRIP study,Daniela Schalke,"The present longitudinal study tackled 2 key aspects of the development of intelligence across a 40-year time period from age 12 to age 52 concerning (a) stability and change in the structure of intelligence with reference to the age differentiation-dedifferentiation hypothesis (how different cognitive abilities relate to each other across age) and (b) differential stabilities (the rank ordering of persons' intelligence levels across time). To this end, we drew on 2 structural conceptions of intelligence: (a) the extended Gf-Gc model to study broad cognitive abilities and (b) the 3-stratum model to decompose cognitive change into processes that are shared by all broad abilities (attributable to general cognitive ability g) and processes specific to a certain ability (independent of g). Data were obtained for 344 persons (56.4% female). The results showed that people differ more greatly over time with respect to all broad abilities except for fluid reasoning, whereas the rank ordering of persons on all broad abilities remains remarkably stable. These combined results yielded substantial gap-widening effects from age 12 to age 52 years that were mainly accounted for by a substantial increase in g variance in combination with a high differential stability of g. Moreover, the increase in g variance reflects an increase in covariance among different broad abilities, which indicates that the different constructs relate more closely to each other at age 52 compared to age 12 (i.e., age dedifferentiation). Two theoretical explanations of this change in the structure of intelligence are discussed (common cause hypothesis and investment theory)."
23148651,Further insights on the French WISC-IV factor structure through Bayesian structural equation modeling,Philippe Golay,"The interpretation of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) is based on a 4-factor model, which is only partially compatible with the mainstream Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence measurement. The structure of cognitive batteries is frequently analyzed via exploratory factor analysis and/or confirmatory factor analysis. With classical confirmatory factor analysis, almost all cross-loadings between latent variables and measures are fixed to zero in order to allow the model to be identified. However, inappropriate zero cross-loadings can contribute to poor model fit, distorted factors, and biased factor correlations; most important, they do not necessarily faithfully reflect theory. To deal with these methodological and theoretical limitations, we used a new statistical approach, Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM), among a sample of 249 French-speaking Swiss children (8-12 years). With BSEM, zero-fixed cross-loadings between latent variables and measures are replaced by approximate zeros, based on informative, small-variance priors. Results indicated that a direct hierarchical CHC-based model with 5 factors plus a general intelligence factor better represented the structure of the WISC-IV than did the 4-factor structure and the higher order models. Because a direct hierarchical CHC model was more adequate, it was concluded that the general factor should be considered as a breadth rather than a superordinate factor. Because it was possible for us to estimate the influence of each of the latent variables on the 15 subtest scores, BSEM allowed improvement of the understanding of the structure of intelligence tests and the clinical interpretation of the subtest scores."
23148648,Formulation of the age-education index: measuring age and education effects in neuropsychological performance,Max Lam,"The complex interplay of education, age, and cognitive performance on various neuropsychological tests is examined in the current study. New education indices were formulated and further investigated to reveal how age and education variances work together to account for performance on neuropsychological tests. Participants were 830 English-speaking ethnic Chinese. Neuropsychological measures such as Verbal Memory, Digit Sequencing, Token Motor Task, Semantic Fluency, Symbol Coding, Tower of London, Judgment of Line Orientation, and Matrix Reasoning of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale were administered. Education was measured by total years of education and adjusted years of education, as well as ratios of both measures with age. Age and education were associated with neuropsychological performance. Adjusted years of education was associated with fluency and higher cognitive processes, while the ratio between adjusted years of education and age was associated with tasks implicating working memory. Changes in education modalities implicated tasks requiring language abilities. Education and age represent key neurodevelopmental milestones. In light of our findings, special consideration should to be given when neuropsychological assessments are carried out in cross-cultural contexts and in societies where educational systems and pedagogy tend to be complex."
23146625,"Postconcussive complaints, cognition, symptom attribution and effort among veterans",Eric B Larson,"The etiology of postconcussive symptoms is not clearly understood. Development of etiological models of those symptoms will be helpful for accurate diagnosis and for planning effective treatment. Such a model should characterize the role of subject characteristics (education, premorbid intelligence), social psychological factors and symptom validity. Toward that end, the present study examined the association of postconcussive complaints and cognitive performance with symptom attribution and level of effort on testing. In a sample of 155 veterans, attribution to concussion was associated with endorsement of more severe postconcussive complaints, after controlling for the effects of other factors such as subject characteristics. Similarly, effort was associated with cognitive performance after controlling for the effects of these other factors. The present findings are consistent with previous reports that illness perception and effort on testing are associated with postconcussive complaints. This supports previous recommendations to routinely educate all concussion patients immediately after injury to reduce distorted perceptions and related persistent complaints. Finally, these findings highlight a need for routine assessment of patients' perception of their injury to identify cases that may require psychotherapy to address any misattributions that develop."
23141681,Cognitive outcome differences on the side of carotid artery stenting,Hideyuki Ishihara,"Objective: The right and left sides of the brain play different roles in cognition. Therefore, the side of treatment should be taken into consideration when evaluating cognitive outcome following revascularization. Thus, we designed a study to evaluate changes in right hemisphere cognitive function in patients undergoing right carotid artery stentings (CAS) and left hemispheric cognitive function in patients undergoing left CAS. In addition, we studied CAS-related changes in regional cerebral blood flow to determine potential correlations with changes in cognitive function. Methods: We performed a prospective assessment of 39 CAS patients, all of whom were right-handed. Patients with contralateral stenotic lesions were excluded. Twenty-one patients underwent CAS of the right internal carotid artery (Right CAS group) and 18 underwent CAS of the left internal carotid artery (Left CAS group). Neuropsychological testing was performed preoperatively and 6 months after endovascular treatment. Cerebral blood flow was determined by 123I-labeled N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography before and 6 months after CAS. Results: In the Right CAS group, postoperative performance intelligence quotient score (91.1±18.2) was significantly improved compared with the preoperative score (84.9±16.7; P<.001). In the Left CAS group, postoperative verbal intelligence quotient score (104.0±18.8) was significantly higher than that before endovascular treatment (97.9±15.8; P<.005). Postoperative regional cerebral blood flow was not significantly different from that before endovascular treatment in either group. However, regional cerebrovascular reactivity of the treated side showed significant improvement after treatment. Conclusions: Amelioration of cognitive function may be dependent on the side of revascularization. Performance intelligence quotient improved after CAS in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis on the right side. Verbal intelligence quotient also improved on the left side after endovascular treatment. These effects seemed to involve improvement in regional cerebrovascular reactivity by CAS."
23141631,Neurocognitive functioning in the prodrome of mania--an exploratory study,Aswin Ratheesh,"Background: Cognitive deficits have been well documented in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) after the first episode of mania. However, little is known about the presence of such deficits prior to the initial manic episode. Methods: Participants were recruited from a cohort of 416 young people who were at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis and were followed up between 4 and 13 years later. The current report is of 16 participants who developed BD over a mean follow-up period of 8.2 years (UHR-BD). Baseline demographic, clinical and neurocognitive assessment scores were compared with those of 46 age and gender matched UHR subjects who did not transition to psychosis or BD over the follow-up period (UHR-NT) and 66 healthy comparison subjects. Results: UHR-BD subjects had lower global functioning at baseline compared with UHR-NT subjects. There were no significant differences between UHR-BD and UHR-NT subjects on baseline demographic and neurocognitive characteristics. UHR-BD subjects had lower test performance than HC on picture completion, Trail-Making Tests and measures of global intelligence. Limitations: Small sample size, limited and variable neurocognitive tests utilised and the confounding effects of psychotic symptoms might have impacted on the ability to detect meaningful clinical and neurocognitive differences. Conclusions: In this exploratory study, neurocognition in young people who later develop BD is similar to those of subjects who are at a high risk for psychotic disorders, but there may be certain neurocognitive markers that distinguish this group from unaffected and healthy young people."
23137723,Association between early attention-deficit/hyperactivity symptoms and current verbal and visuo-spatial short-term memory,Susan Shur-Fen Gau,"Deficits in short-term memory are common in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but their current ADHD symptoms cannot well predict their short-term performance. Taking a developmental perspective, we wanted to clarify the association between ADHD symptoms at early childhood and short-term memory in late childhood and adolescence. The participants included 401 patients with a clinical diagnosis of DSM-IV ADHD, 213 siblings, and 176 unaffected controls aged 8-17 years (mean age, 12.02 ± 2.24). All participants and their mothers were interviewed using the Chinese Kiddie Epidemiologic version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia to obtain information about ADHD symptoms and other psychiatric disorders retrospectively, at an earlier age first, then currently. The participants were assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--3rd edition, including Digit Span, and the Spatial working memory task of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Multi-level regression models were used for data analysis. Although crude analyses revealed that inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity symptoms significantly predicted deficits in short-term memory, only inattention symptoms had significant effects (all p<0.001) in a model that included all three ADHD symptoms. After further controlling for comorbidity, age of assessment, treatment with methylphenidate, and Full-scale IQ, the severity of childhood inattention symptoms was still significantly associated with worse verbal (p = 0.008) and spatial (p ranging from 0.017 to 0.002) short-term memory at the current assessment. Therefore, our findings suggest that earlier inattention symptoms are associated with impaired verbal and visuo-spatial short-term memory at a later development stage. Impaired short-term memory in adolescence can be detected earlier by screening for the severity of inattention in childhood."
23137007,"The effect of esthetic crown lengthening on perceptions of a patient's attractiveness, friendliness, trustworthiness, intelligence, and self-confidence",Sam Malkinson,"Background: Smile esthetics have been shown to play a major role in the perception of whether a person is attractive, and whether they are perceived as friendly, trustworthy, intelligent, and self-confident. A proposed major determinant of the esthetics of a smile is the amount of gingival display, which can be excessive in cases of altered passive eruption. The aim of this study is to see whether altering the amount of gingival display of patients would affect dental professionals' and laypersons' perceptions of the aforementioned social parameters. Methods: Patients were identified as having altered passive eruption and excessive gingival display. Smiling ""control"" photographs were taken and then digitally altered so as to lengthen the teeth and thus reduce the amount of gingival display. These became the ""test"" photographs. The control and test photographs were shown in random order. The control group of evaluators consisted of senior dental students, and the test group of evaluators comprised students who had no formal dental training. Groups were asked to rate, on a visual analog scale, each picture's attractiveness, friendliness, trustworthiness, intelligence, and self-confidence. Results: The test pictures with less gingival display were consistently and statistically significantly rated higher for all five social parameters than were their control counterparts (P <0.0001). When analyzed as an isolated effect, there were no statistically significant differences between the control group and the test group of evaluators when rating the pictures. Pictures depicting African Americans were judged to be more trustworthy (P = 0.0467) and self-confident (P = 0.0490) than pictures depicting white individuals. Pictures depicting women were judged to be more trustworthy (P = 0.0159) and intelligent (P = 0.0329) than pictures depicting men. All the social parameters were positively and statistically significantly correlated with each other (P <0.0001). Conclusions: Excessive gingival display did negatively affect how attractive a person's smile is judged to be. In addition, how friendly, trustworthy, intelligent, and self-confident a person was perceived to be was inversely related to the amount of gingival display. Untrained laypeople were just as sensitive to these differences as senior dental students."
23136950,Measuring the ability to perceive the emotional connotations of written language,Kimberly A Barchard,"Emotionally laden writing is essential to our personal and professional lives. The purpose of this article was to design and evaluate a new test of the ability to decode the emotional connotations of written material. A series of 3 studies (totaling 457 participants) were used to demonstrate that the Metaphors Test measures a single construct, has strong internal consistency, has strong convergent validity with tests related to emotional and social intelligence, and has strong discriminant validity with vocabulary and personality. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the Metaphors Test is more closely associated with emotion perception than emotional understanding. Unlike most other tests that tap this skill, the stimuli for the Metaphors Test do not include any explicit emotion words; it is therefore a unique and valuable measure of emotion perception."
23134564,Nonverbal signals speak up: association between perceptual nonverbal dominance and emotional intelligence,Heike Jacob,"Emotional communication uses verbal and nonverbal means. In case of conflicting signals, nonverbal information is assumed to have a stronger impact. It is unclear, however, whether perceptual nonverbal dominance varies between individuals and whether it is linked to emotional intelligence. Using audiovisual stimulus material comprising verbal and nonverbal emotional cues that were varied independently, perceptual nonverbal dominance profiles and their relations to emotional intelligence were examined. Nonverbal dominance was found in every participant, ranging from 55 to 100%. Moreover, emotional intelligence, particularly the ability to understand emotions, correlated positively with nonverbal dominance. Furthermore, higher overall emotional intelligence as well as a higher ability to understand emotions were linked to smaller reaction time differences between emotionally incongruent and congruent stimuli. The association between perceptual nonverbal dominance and emotional intelligence, and more specifically the ability to understand emotions, might reflect an adaptive process driven by the experience of higher authenticity in nonverbal cues."
23130086,Corpus Callosum Area in Children and Adults with Autism,Molly B D Prigge,"Despite repeated findings of abnormal corpus callosum structure in autism, the developmental trajectories of corpus callosum growth in the disorder have not yet been reported. In this study, we examined corpus callosum size from a developmental perspective across a 30-year age range in a large cross-sectional sample of individuals with autism compared to a typically developing sample. Midsagittal corpus callosum area and the 7 Witelson subregions were examined in 68 males with autism (mean age 14.1 years; range 3-36 years) and 47 males with typical development (mean age 15.3 years; range 4-29 years). Controlling for total brain volume, increased variability in total corpus callosum area was found in autism. In autism, increased midsagittal areas were associated with reduced severity of autism behaviors, higher intelligence, and faster speed of processing (p=0.003, p=0.011, p=0.013, respectively). A trend toward group differences in isthmus development was found (p=0.029, uncorrected). These results suggest that individuals with autism benefit functionally from increased corpus callosum area. Our cross-sectional examination also shows potential maturational abnormalities in autism, a finding that should be examined further with longitudinal datasets."
23127656,Integrating forensic information in a crime intelligence database,Quentin Rossy,"Since 2008, intelligence units of six states of the western part of Switzerland have been sharing a common database for the analysis of high volume crimes. On a daily basis, events reported to the police are analysed, filtered and classified to detect crime repetitions and interpret the crime environment. Several forensic outcomes are integrated in the system such as matches of traces with persons, and links between scenes detected by the comparison of forensic case data. Systematic procedures have been settled to integrate links assumed mainly through DNA profiles, shoemarks patterns and images. A statistical outlook on a retrospective dataset of series from 2009 to 2011 of the database informs for instance on the number of repetition detected or confirmed and increased by forensic case data. Time needed to obtain forensic intelligence in regard with the type of marks treated, is seen as a critical issue. Furthermore, the underlying integration process of forensic intelligence into the crime intelligence database raised several difficulties in regards of the acquisition of data and the models used in the forensic databases. Solutions found and adopted operational procedures are described and discussed. This process form the basis to many other researches aimed at developing forensic intelligence models."
23126461,Risk factors for postconcussion symptom reporting after traumatic brain injury in U.S. military service members,Rael T Lange,"The purpose of this study was to identify factors that are predictive of, or associated with, postconcussion symptom reporting after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the U.S. military. Participants were 125 U.S. military service members (age: M=29.6 years, standard deviation [SD]=8.9, range=18-56 years) who sustained a TBI, divided into two groups based on symptom criteria for postconcussional disorder (PCD): PCD-Present (n=65) and PCD-Absent (n=60). Participants completed a neuropsychological evaluation at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (M=9.4 months after injury, SD=9.9; range: 1.1 to 44.8). Factors examined included demographic characteristics, injury-related variables, psychological testing, and effort testing. There were no significant group differences for age, sex, education, race, estimated premorbid intelligence, number of deployments, combat versus non-combat related injury, or mechanism of injury (p>0.098 for all). There were significant main effects for severity of body injury, duration of loss of consciousness, duration of post-traumatic amnesia, intracranial abnormality, time tested post-injury, possible symptom exaggeration, poor effort, depression, and traumatic stress (p<0.044 for all). PCD symptom reporting was most strongly associated with possible symptom exaggeration, poor effort, depression, and traumatic stress. PCD rarely occurred in the absence of depression, traumatic stress, possible symptom exaggeration, or poor effort (n=7, 5.6%). Many factors unrelated to brain injury were influential in self-reported postconcussion symptoms in this sample. Clinicians cannot assume uncritically that endorsement of items on a postconcussion symptom checklist is indicative of residual effects from a brain injury."
23126275,Perception of affective prosody in patients at an early stage of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,Markus Kraemer,"Cognitive dysfunction is well known in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS) and has been described for many years. Cognitive impairment, memory, and attention deficits seem to be features of advanced MS stages, whereas depression and emotional instability already occur in early stages of the disease. However, little is known about processing of affective prosody in patients in early stages of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). In this study, tests assessing attention, memory, and processing of affective prosody were administered to 25 adult patients with a diagnosis of RRMS at an early stage and to 25 healthy controls (HC). Early stages of the disease were defined as being diagnosed with RRMS in the last 2 years and having an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 2 or lower. Patients and HC were comparable in intelligence quotient (IQ), educational level, age, handedness, and gender. Patients with early stages of RRMS performed below the control group with respect to the subtests 'discrimination of affective prosody' and 'matching of affective prosody to facial expression' for the emotion 'angry' of the 'Tübingen Affect Battery'. These deficits were not related to executive performance. Our findings suggest that emotional prosody comprehension is deficient in young patients with early stages of RRMS. Deficits in discriminating affective prosody early in the disease may make misunderstandings and poor communication more likely. This might negatively influence interpersonal relationships and quality of life in patients with RRMS."
23125396,Improving social cognition in schizophrenia: a pilot intervention combining computerized social cognition training with cognitive remediation,Jean-Pierre Lindenmayer,"Background: Social cognition is significantly impaired in schizophrenia and contributes to poor community functioning. This study examined whether cognitive remediation (CR; COGPACK), shown to improve neurocognition, improves an integral component of social cognition, emotion perception, compared with CR combined with a computerized Emotion Perception intervention (Mind Reading: Interactive Guide to Emotions [MRIGE]). Methods: 59 stable schizophrenia or schizoaffective predominantly inpatients were randomized to either CR (N=27) alone or CR+MRIGE (N=32) for 12 weeks. Assessments included the Facial Emotion Identification Task (FEIT), Facial Emotion Discrimination Task (FEDT), MCCB-MATRICS, Personal and Social Performance Scale, and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Results: There was a significant group-by-time effect on FEIT (F=11.509, P=.004); CR+MRIGE demonstrated signiﬁcantly greater improvement than CR alone (CR+MRIGE, Z=1.89, P=.05; CR alone Z=0.57, P=.13). There was significant group-by-time effect on FEDT (F=5.663, P=.022); CR+MRIGE demonstrated signiﬁcantly greater improvement than CR alone (CR+MRIGE, Z=1.90, P=.05; CR alone Z=0.67, P=.21). There was also a significant group by time effect for social cognition, measured by the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (F=5.473, P=.050): CR+MRIGE demonstrated significantly greater improvement than CR alone (CR+MRIGE, Z=1.98, P=.02; CR alone, Z=1.00, P=.05). Conclusions: Combined CR with emotion perception remediation produced greater improvements in emotion recognition, emotion discrimination, social functioning, and neurocognition compared with CR alone in chronic schizophrenia."
23123882,Everyday memory in children with developmental coordination disorder,I-Chen Chen,"Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) have deficits in working memory, but little is known about the everyday memory of these children in real-life situations. We investigated the everyday memory function in children with DCD, and explored the specific profile of everyday memory across different domains. Nineteen children with DCD and 19 typically developing (TD) children participated in the study. Their everyday memory performance was evaluated using the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test for Children, which showed that 52.6% of the children with DCD had everyday memory deficits. The overall everyday memory scores of the DCD group were significantly lower than those of the controls, particularly in the verbal and visual memory domains. Pearson correlation analysis indicated significant associations between verbal intelligence and memory scores. Analysis of covariance with verbal intelligence as a covariate showed no significant differences between groups in memory scores. Mediator analysis supported the notion that everyday memory deficits in children with DCD were fully mediated through verbal intelligence. We provide evidence of everyday memory deficits in most of the children with DCD, and hypothesize that language abilities are their underlying cause. The clinical implications of these findings and recommendations for additional research are discussed."
23121133,Brain magnetic resonance imaging and motor and intellectual functioning in 86 patients born at term with spastic diplegia,Yurika Numata,"Aim: To investigate the association between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns and motor function, epileptic episodes, and IQ or developmental quotient in patients born at term with spastic diplegia. Method: Eighty-six patients born at term with cerebral palsy (CP) and spastic diplegia (54 males, 32 females; median age 20 y, range 7-42 y) among 829 patients with CP underwent brain MRI between 1990 and 2008. The MRI and clinical findings were analysed retrospectively. Intellectual disability was classified according to the Enjoji developmental test or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (3rd edition). Results: The median ages at diagnosis of CP, assignment of Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level, cognitive assessment, and MRI were 2 years (range 5 mo-8 y), 6 years (2 y 8 mo-19 y), 6 years (1 y 4 mo-19 y), and 7 years (10 mo-30 y) respectively. MRI included normal findings (41.9%), periventricular leukomalacia, hypomyelination, and porencephaly/periventricular venous infarction. The frequency of patients in GMFCS levels III to V and intellectual disability did not differ between those with normal and abnormal MRI findings. Patients with normal MRI findings had significantly fewer epileptic episodes than those with abnormal ones (p=0.001). Interpretation: Varied MRI findings, as well as the presence of severe motor dysfunction and intellectual disability (despite normal MRI), suggest that patients born at term with spastic diplegia had heterogeneous and unidentified pathophysiology."
23116771,Imaging and genetics of language and cognition in pediatric epilepsy,Laura Addis,"This paper presents translational aspects of imaging and genetic studies of language and cognition in children with epilepsy of average intelligence. It also discusses current unanswered translational questions in each of these research areas. A brief review of multimodal imaging and language study findings shows that abnormal structure and function, as well as plasticity and reorganization in language-related cortical regions, are found both in children with epilepsy with normal language skills and in those with linguistic deficits. The review on cognition highlights that multiple domains of impaired cognition and abnormalities in brain structure and/or connectivity are evident early on in childhood epilepsy and might be specific for epilepsy syndrome. The description of state-of-the-art genetic analyses that can be used to explain the convergence of language impairment and Rolandic epilepsy includes a discussion of the methodological difficulties involved in these analyses. Two junior researchers describe how their current and planned studies address some of the unanswered translational questions regarding cognition and imaging and the genetic analysis of speech sound disorder, reading, and centrotemporal spikes in Rolandic epilepsy."
23113813,The validity of the Health-Relevant Personality Inventory (HP5i) and the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory (JTCI) among adolescents referred for a substance misuse problem,Malin Hemphälä,"The aim was to study the validity of 2 personality instruments, the Health-Relevant Personality Inventory (HP5i) and the Junior Temperament and Character Inventory (JTCI), among adolescents with a substance use problem. Clinical interviews were completed with 180 adolescents and followed up after 12 months. Discriminant validity was demonstrated in the lack of correlation to intelligence in both instruments' scales. Two findings were in support of convergent validity: Negative affectivity (HP5i) and harm avoidance (JTCI) were correlated to internalizing symptoms, and impulsivity (HP5i) and novelty seeking (JTCI) were correlated to externalizing symptoms. The predictive validity of JTCI was partly supported. When psychiatric symptoms at baseline were controlled for, cooperativeness predicted conduct disorder after 12 months. Summarizing, both instruments can be used in adolescent clinical samples to tailor treatment efforts, although some scales need further investigation. It is important to include personality assessment when evaluating psychiatric problems in adolescents."
23113796,Text-to-audiovisual speech synthesizer for children with learning disabilities,Engin Mendi,"Learning disabilities affect the ability of children to learn, despite their having normal intelligence. Assistive tools can highly increase functional capabilities of children with learning disorders such as writing, reading, or listening. In this article, we describe a text-to-audiovisual synthesizer that can serve as an assistive tool for such children. The system automatically converts an input text to audiovisual speech, providing synchronization of the head, eye, and lip movements of the three-dimensional face model with appropriate facial expressions and word flow of the text. The proposed system can enhance speech perception and help children having learning deficits to improve their chances of success."
23112235,Atypical hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV with neither mental retardation nor pain insensitivity,Chae Lim Jung,"Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe mental retardation and self-mutilation-related complications. Recently, we investigated a 16-year-old Korean boy with normal intelligence. He had preserved pain sensation but was suspected of having hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV because of the recurrent bone fractures and painless joint destruction in the absence of any predisposing medical conditions. Genetic analysis of the NTRK1 gene revealed compound heterozygous mutations including c.851-33T>A and c.2303C>T (p.Pro768Leu) in the NTRK1 gene. The p.Pro768Leu mutation has been identified in 2 Japanese patients with a mild phenotype. Therefore, although it is rare, hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV should be considered in patients with recurrent bone fractures and painless joint destruction who do not have any predisposing conditions even when they do not have typical clinical features such as mental retardation or pain insensitivity."
23104994,Parents' emotional intelligence and children's type I diabetes management,Leehu Zysberg,"We hypothesized that parents' emotional intelligence associates with their children's type I diabetes outcomes. Eighty-one parents, the main caregivers of their diabetic children, filled out two measures of emotional intelligence and a demographic questionnaire. Three indicators of diabetes management were collected from the patients' files: hemoglobin A1c, mean blood tests per day, and mean blood glucose levels. Emotional intelligence associated with all glycemic management indices, though differences were found between the two measures. Of the demographic factors, income level showed some association with the outcome measures. The results are discussed in light of existing theories and models."
23104618,Neurocognitive functioning in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder,Outi Reinvall,"There is a paucity of research studying comprehensive neurocognitive profiles of adolescents with higher functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This study compared the neurocognitive profiles of higher functioning adolescents with ASD (n = 30, mean age 13.5) with that of typically developing adolescents (n = 30; mean age 13.7). Adolescents with ASD demonstrated a significantly higher mean Verbal Intelligence Quotient compared to the standardized mean. However, the ASD group had significantly lower scores than the control group on the subtests Auditory Attention and Response Set, Memory for Faces, Visuomotor Precision, and Design Copying. Thus, particular strengths were seen in verbal reasoning, while weaknesses were observed in auditory attention, facial recognition memory, and visuomotor functions in adolescents with ASD."
23103382,Predictors of successful communication with interactive voice response systems in older people,Delyana Miller,"Objectives: Interactive voice response (IVR) systems are computer programs that can interact with people to provide a number of services from business to health care. However, surveys examining people's attitudes toward these systems have consistently found that people in general and older people in particular strongly dislike these systems. We wanted to determine the memory and cognitive abilities that predict successful IVR interactions for older people. Method: We compared the performance of 185 older adults (aged 65 and older) on normed cognitive tests (the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale fourth edition and the Wechsler Memory Scale fourth edition) with their performance on 4 real-life IVR systems that included fact-finding at governmental agencies and plane ticket reservation. Results: The results indicated that adults aged 65 and older experience significant difficulties in interacting with IVR systems. A significant number of people (20.5%) could not complete any of the tasks. Participants who could not complete any task were older and had the lowest full-scale IQ. However, there was little difference between the age of participants who completed 1, 2, 3, or 4 tasks. Rather, auditory memory and working memory were the best overall predictors for success in IVR tasks. Discussion: The impact of poorer auditory memory and working memory is compounded by programming practices that increase the demand on these abilities and create unnecessary difficulties. Successful use of IVR systems could eventually complement in person health services."
23098375,The connection between maternal thiamine shortcoming and offspring cognitive damage and poverty perpetuation in underprivileged communities across the world,Fernando M V Dias,"The acquisition of cognitive, sensory-motor and social emotional functions depend on a proper development of the Central Nervous System (CNS). This set of functions, known as intelligence, allows a better adaptation to the environment. In the last decades, an increase in the average of intelligence has been reported. However, such an increase cannot be observed in an equivalent way in economically and social underprivileged regions. Children from those regions are in great risk of being affected by mental retardation or impaired cognitive development. In later life they will, probably, be unable to transform and improve themselves and their communities, perpetuating the poverty of the region. Therefore, knowledge of factors involved in CNS development is a matter of health closely related to social improvement. Malnutrition throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding is clearly identifiable as a cause of damage in CNS development. Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) is a micronutrient important to the growth and maturity of the CNS. Thiamine shortcoming may affect 50% of pregnant women. Thiamine function in cerebral development is still not well known. There is a gap in the literature regarding systematical research about the blood thiamine concentration throughout the periods of gestation and breastfeeding. These studies are relevant in populations with a high level of nutritional vulnerability, because in a follow up offspring cognitive exam they could reveal if the maternal thiamine deficiency is related to child CNS impairment. This paper introduce the hypothesis that thiamine shortcoming during pregnancy and breastfeeding is directly related to cognitive impairment of child. Data about the neurophysiological role of thiamine, consequences of its shortcoming in experimental models, populations under the risk of thiamine shortcoming are presented. The hypothesis that maternal thiamine shortcoming causes damage related to child cognitive development needs to be considered. Thus, thiamine shortcoming during gestation and breastfeeding and its effects on children must be studied in many populations in order to know the magnitude of the problem and to indicate actions to overcome it."
23098329,Patients with bipolar disorders share similar but attenuated prospective memory impairments with patients with schizophrenia,R C K Chan,"Background: Prospective memory (PM) refers to the ability to remember to carry out an intended action in the future. PM is consistently found to be impaired in individuals with schizophrenia. Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia may represent conditions along a continuum, and share similar neurocognitive and genetic architecture. This study aimed to compare the nature and extent of PM impairment in individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Method: Participants were 38 out-patients with schizophrenia and 40 out-patients with bipolar disorder in an early psychosis intervention programme, and 37 healthy controls. Time-, event- and activity-based PMs were assessed using a dual-task laboratory paradigm. Self-reported PM performance was gauged using the Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with intelligence quotient (IQ) and education included as covariates, was used to examine group difference on various types of PM. Repeated measures of ANCOVA were used to examine the group × PM type interaction effect. Correspondence between laboratory and self-reported PM measures was examined using correlational analysis. Results: The group × PM type interaction effect was not significant, but the main effect of group was significant. Patients with schizophrenia and patients with bipolar disorder both performed more poorly than healthy participants in PM. The two clinical groups did not significantly differ in PM. Laboratory and self-reported PM measures did not correlate significantly with each other. Conclusions: Patients with bipolar disorder shared a similar PM impairment with those with schizophrenia. Findings of this study extended the similarity in neurocognitive impairments between the two psychiatric disorders to PM."
23095048,Neuropsychological profile in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1 compared to a control group,M-J Descheemaeker,"Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common inherited autosomal dominant condition, characterised by multiple café-au-lait macules, axillary and/or inguinal freckling, iris Lisch nodules and tumours of the nervous system such as neurofibromas and optic pathway gliomas. At the same time, NF1 is frequently associated with intellectual disabilities across several neuropsychological domains. Existing neuropsychological data in NF1 adults are limited and sometimes contradictory. Moreover, most studies use a non-IQ-controlled norm group for comparison. This study sought to investigate specific neuropsychological characteristics in intellectual abilities unrelated to the global intellectual capacity. Method: Twenty NF1 adults and an IQ-, age- and gender-matched control group completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery composed of specific cognitive tests investigating visual-spatial abilities and memory, auditory memory, selective and sustained attention and executive functioning. A short version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - III was also administered to both groups. Results: Norm comparison showed that both groups perform poorly on most neuropsychological functions, except for sustained attention. However, comparison with the IQ-matched control group showed significantly lower scores on visual-spatial abilities and memory, on auditory working memory and on tests for cognitive flexibility in NF1 adults. Nevertheless, as the significant difference in average estimated IQ score between the NF1 group and the selected control group almost reaches the 5% significance level, further analysis is needed to include IQ as a covariate. Eventually, problems in visual-spatial skills and auditory long-term memory seem to be specific NF1-related deficits, while problems in attention and executive functioning are particularly related to their general lowered intellectual abilities. Conclusion: Taking into account that primary visual perception problems could be part of a more general central coherence deficit while interpreting auditory memory problems as possibly related to deficits in language use and comprehension, this idea also fits with the observation of several problems in social information processing and functioning of NF1 persons."
23092885,Cigarette affordability in Europe,Evan Blecher,"Objective: To analyze trends in excise taxes, real price and the affordability of cigarettes in Europe, and to examine the impact of EU wide tax policies on new member states. Design: We use a sample of 37 European countries with data from 2004 to 2010. 27 countries are EU member states of which 12 joined in 2004 or 2007 (new members), while 10 non-EU countries are included as a comparison. Data is sourced from the European Commission and the Economist Intelligence Unit. Results: The excise tax burden increased in all new member states between 2004 and 2010 while remaining relatively unchanged in existing member states. In 2010, the excise tax burden was higher in new (mean 63.8%) than in existing member states (mean 59.4%). Although cigarettes were significant cheaper in new member states the difference in affordability was narrower between the two groups. Excise taxes and prices rose aggressively in new member states while the increases in existing member states were smaller. While cigarettes became less affordable in most EU member states there was little difference between new and existing member states. The average annual percentage change in per-capita cigarette consumption was negative in all existing member states and in 9 of 12 new member states between 2004 and 2010, indicating declining per-capita cigarette consumption. Conclusions: Joining the EU results in significant increases in excise taxes and prices, and declines in affordability. Additionally, the structure of taxes, specifically the high excise tax floor resulted in higher taxes and prices."
23092686,The benign spectrum of hypothalamic hamartomas: infrequent epilepsy and normal cognition in patients presenting with central precocious puberty,Priscilla Cukier,"Purpose: Hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) is the main structural cause of central precocious puberty (CPP). HH is frequently associated with cognitive impairment and epileptic encephalopathies. Disease severity in case series from neurology services may be biased towards more neurologically impaired patients. Aim: To perform a prospective cognitive evaluation in patients with HH presenting with CPP in an endocrinology outpatient clinic setting. Methods: We evaluated fifteen consecutive patients with CPP due to HH presenting to an endocrinology outpatient clinic. CPP was diagnosed at a median age of 0.7 yr (0.4-7 yr). Mean age at neurologic evaluation was 13.9 yrs. Eight patients (53.3%) were male. Epileptic seizures occurred in 5/15 (33%) patients. Two patients presented a single unprovoked seizure (SUS). Three patients were diagnosed with epilepsy. Cognitive evaluation, using age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence Scale, was performed in 11 patients. Results: All patients without epilepsy, including two patients with a history of a SUS, had normal neurologic and cognitive evaluation. Epilepsy and SUS were only seen in patients with sessile HH. Three patients with epilepsy presented cognitive or behavioral findings. Reduced intelligence quotients (IQ), in the borderline range, were noted in both patients with epilepsy who underwent full cognitive evaluation. We found no significant correlation between HH diameter or shape and mean full-scale IQ. Conclusions: Patients who presented with isolated CPP without epilepsy displayed normal cognition when evaluated after a mean period of 13 years. Occurrence of epilepsy, seen in a minority of patients, but not of a single seizure, was associated with mild cognitive deficit and behavioral disturbances in this case series."
23088375,The level and nature of autistic intelligence III: Inspection time,Elise B Barbeau,"Across the autism spectrum, level of intelligence is highly dependent on the psychometric instrument used for assessment, and there are conflicting views concerning which measures best estimate autistic cognitive abilities. Inspection time is a processing speed measure associated with general intelligence in typical individuals. We therefore investigated autism spectrum performance on inspection time in relation to two different general intelligence tests. Autism spectrum individuals were divided into autistic and Asperger subgroups according to speech development history. Compared to a typical control group, mean inspection time for the autistic subgroup but not the Asperger subgroup was significantly shorter (by 31%). However, the shorter mean autistic inspection time was evident only when groups were matched on Wechsler IQ and disappeared when they were matched using Raven's Progressive Matrices. When autism spectrum abilities are compared to typical abilities, results may be influenced by speech development history as well as by the instrument used for intelligence matching."
23088232,Are all interventions created equal? A multi-threat approach to tailoring stereotype threat interventions,Jenessa R Shapiro,"To date, stereotype threat interventions have been considered interchangeable. Across 4 experiments, the present research demonstrates that stereotype threat interventions need to be tailored to the specific form of experienced stereotype threat to be effective. The Multi-Threat Framework (Shapiro & Neuberg, 2007) distinguishes between group-as-target stereotype threats-concerns that a stereotype-relevant performance will reflect poorly on the abilities of one's group-and self-as-target stereotype threats-concerns that a stereotype-relevant performance will reflect poorly on one's own abilities. The present experiments explored Black college students' performance on diagnostic intelligence tests (Experiments 1 and 3) and women's interest (Experiment 2) and performance (Experiment 4) in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Across the 4 experiments, participants were randomly assigned to experience either a group-as-target or self-as-target stereotype threat. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that role model interventions were successful at protecting only against group-as-target stereotype threats, and Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that self-affirmation interventions were successful at protecting only against self-as-target stereotype threats. The present research provides an experimental test of the Multi-Threat Framework across different negatively stereotyped groups (Black students, female students), different negatively stereotyped domains (general intelligence, STEM), and different outcomes (test performance, career interest). This research suggests that interventions should address the range of possible stereotype threats to effectively protect individuals against these threats. Through an appreciation of the distinct forms of stereotype threats and the ways in which interventions work to reduce them, this research aims to facilitate a more complete understanding of stereotype threat."
23085818,"Lack of severe long-term outcomes of acute, subclinical B1 deficiency in 216 children in Israel exposed in early infancy",Asher Ornoy,"Background: A vitamin B(1)-deficient soy-based infant formula was marketed in Israel in 2003, exposing infants to clinical or subclinical B(1) deficiency. We investigated whether subclinical B(1) deficiency in early infancy had medical, neurodevelopmental, or cognitive effects at 3-5 y of age. Methods: A historical prospective cohort study was conducted consisting of four groups: ""exposed,"" consuming a B(1)-deficient soy-based formula exclusively for four consecutive weeks or longer; ""control,"" consuming no soy-based formula; ""mixed,"" consuming the formula nonexclusively or exclusively for less than four consecutive weeks; and ""other,"" consuming soy-based formulas other than Remedia. Participants were evaluated by medical examination, Stanford-Binet (SB) intelligence test, sensory profile evaluation, and Conners scales (attention deficit disorder/attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD)). Results: Following adjustment for gender, age, and maternal education, there were no significant differences among the four groups on the mean SB scores, on the verbal and nonverbal scores, or in the proportion of children in each group with scores <90. A significantly higher proportion of exposed children as compared with control children had an impaired sensory profile and scores on the Conners scales (ADD/ADHD), but these proportions were also high in the ""other"" and ""mixed"" groups. Conclusion: The results do not support an association between subclinical B(1) deficiency in infancy and long-term development."
23084574,Motor and cognitive outcome at school age of children with surgically treated intestinal obstructions in the neonatal period,Rachel M Elsinga,"Background: The motor and cognitive outcome at school age of newborn children with surgically treated intestinal obstructions is unknown. Physiological stress and anesthesia may potentially be harmful in the period of early brain development in newborn infants. Objective: To determine motor and cognitive outcome at school age in children with surgically treated intestinal obstructions as newborns, and to identify clinical risk factors for adverse outcome. Study design: Cohort study of infants born between 1995 and 2002 with atresia, stenosis, or intestinal malrotation. At 6 to 13years we assessed their motor functions, intelligence, attention, visual perception, visuomotor integration, and verbal memory. Results: Of 44 children three (7%) died. Twenty-seven survivors (66%) were included for follow-up (median gestational age 36.7weeks, birth weight 3000g). Motor outcome was abnormal (<5th percentile) in 22% of the children, which was significantly more than in the norm population (P<0.01). Scores on selective attention were abnormal in 15% of the children (P<0.01). Other cognitive functions were not affected. Lower birth weight and intestinal perforation were risk factors for poorer motor outcome (R(2)=53.0%), intrauterine growth restriction was a risk factor for poorer selective attention (R(2)=36.6%). Conclusions: Children treated surgically for intestinal obstructions in the neonatal period had an increased risk for poor motor functioning and selective attention at school age. Low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction and intestinal perforation were risk factors for adverse outcome. We recommend to closely follow the motor and attentional development of these children."
23082749,Understanding processing speed--its subcomponents and their relationship to characteristics of people with schizophrenia,Matteo Cella,"Introduction: Processing speed has been advanced as one of the core cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. Several methods were developed to assess this domain; however, most tasks, despite indexing several cognitive and motor components, tend to characterise processing speed as a unitary construct. This study explores potential subcomponents of processing speed in schizophrenia and their relationship with demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological characteristics. Methods: One hundred and sixty participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were assessed on neuropsychological tasks measuring processing speed, executive function, and memory. Demographics and clinical characteristics were also recorded. Three independent measures were extracted to account for subcomponents of processing speed: behavioural execution, response processing, and accuracy. Results: The identified components of processing speed were differently predicted by demographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and overall intelligence estimates. Age and symptom severity were important predictors for behavioural execution; intelligence and social withdrawal predicted response processing; and accuracy was predicted by illness duration. Correlations showed executive function and memory to be associated with response processing and accuracy but not with behavioural execution. Conclusions: Distinct characteristics of schizophrenia seem to predict processing speed subcomponents. Distinguishing between behavioural, processing, and accuracy may be a useful way forward to refine our understanding of processing speed impairment in schizophrenia."
23076764,"Alexithymia and emotional intelligence in patients with panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder",Elif Onur,"Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a broad personality construct signifying the ability to perceive and to regulate affects within oneself. Alexithymia is another personality construct denoting difficulty in identifying and expressing emotions, with an externally oriented thinking style. Although previously considered to be independent, some studies have shown that these constructs overlap. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the levels of EI and alexithymia in patients with panic disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The subjects included 171 psychiatric patients and 56 non-clinical controls. Psychiatric diagnoses were based on DSM-IV criteria. The Emotional Intelligence Scale-34 (EIS-34) and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) were used to assess EI and alexithymia. All three patient groups scored statistically significantly higher than the non-clinical controls on TAS-20 total score and the TAS-20 subfactors of difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings. EIS-34 scores were lower in patient groups than in the non-clinical controls, but only the EIS-34 intrapersonal subscale was significant difference. Total TAS-20 and EIS-34 scores in the patient cohort were inversely and significantly correlated These results reaffirm an overlap between EI and alexithymia with the intrapersonal factor of EI to be more dependent on the difficulty identifying feelings dimension of alexithymia in subjects with MDD and GAD."
23076736,Insight in schizophrenia: associations with empathy,G H M Pijnenborg,"Many people with schizophrenia (50-80%) demonstrate impaired insight, something which has been associated with a poorer outcome. Two types of empathy can be distinguished: affective empathy via shared emotions and cognitive empathy, also referred to as Theory of Mind (ToM). ToM can be subdivided into cognitive ToM (knowledge about beliefs of other people via perspective taking) and affective ToM (knowledge about other people's emotions via perspective taking). Recent studies show a relationship between Theory of Mind (ToM) and insight. However, the relationship between affective empathy and insight in schizophrenia was not examined previously. This was the aim of the present study. We expected that affective empathy would show a stronger relationship with insight than both cognitive and affective ToM. We assessed forty-six patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and fifty-three healthy controls were assessed with a test battery consisting of tests of social cognition (a self-rating scale for affective empathy, a ToM task assessing both cognitive and affective ToM, and two tests of emotion perception), verbal memory, executive functioning, psychomotor speed, and intelligence. Insight was assessed with item G12 of the PANSS-interview. A regression equation showed that affective empathy made the strongest unique contribution to insight, followed closely by affective ToM. Together, they explained 45% of the variance in insight. None of the other independent variables made a unique contribution to the prediction of insight. Both affective ToM and affective empathy are associated with insight in schizophrenia. Being able to take empathize with other peoples feeling at both the affective and cognitive level may enhance insight in schizophrenia."
23076102,Not so primitive: context-sensitive meta-learning about unattended sound sequences,Juanita Todd,"Mismatch negativity (MMN), an evoked response potential elicited when a ""deviant"" sound violates a regularity in the auditory environment, is integral to auditory scene processing and has been used to demonstrate ""primitive intelligence"" in auditory short-term memory. Using a new multiple-context and -timescale protocol we show that MMN magnitude displays a context-sensitive modulation depending on changes in the probability of a deviant at multiple temporal scales. We demonstrate a primacy bias causing asymmetric evidence-based modulation of predictions about the environment, and we demonstrate that learning how to learn about deviant probability (meta-learning) induces context-sensitive variation in the accessibility of predictive long-term memory representations that underpin the MMN. The existence of the bias and meta-learning are consistent with automatic attributions of behavioral salience governing relevance-filtering processes operating outside of awareness."
23063447,Influence of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene on the brain and working memory in men with normal FMR1 alleles,Jun Yi Wang,"The fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene plays an important role in the development and maintenance of neuronal circuits that are essential for cognitive functioning. We explored the functional linkage(s) among lymphocytic FMR1 gene expression, brain structure, and working memory in healthy adult males. We acquired T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging from 37 males (18-80 years, mean ± SD= 40.7 ± 17.3 years) with normal FMR1 alleles and performed genetic and working memory assessments. Brain measurements were obtained from fiber tracts important for working memory (i.e. the arcuate fasciculus, anterior cingulum bundle, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and the genu and anterior body of the corpus callosum), individual voxels, and whole brain. Both FMR1 mRNA and protein (FMRP) levels exhibited significant associations with brain measurements, with FMRP correlating positively with gray matter volume and white matter structural organization, and FMR1 mRNA negatively with white matter structural organization. The correlation was widespread, impacting rostral white matter and 2 working-memory fiber tracts for FMRP, and all cerebral white matter areas except the fornix and cerebellar peduncles and all 4 fiber tracts for FMR1 mRNA. In addition, the levels of FMR1 mRNA as well as the fiber tracts demonstrated a significant correlation with working memory performance. While FMR1 mRNA exhibited a negative correlation with working memory, fiber tract structural organization showed a positive correlation. These findings suggest that the FMR1 gene is a genetic factor common for both working memory and brain structure, and has implications for our understanding of the transmission of intelligence and brain structure."
23062661,Pilot evaluation of a ward-based automated hand hygiene training system,Anarta Ghosh,"A novel artificial intelligence (AI) system (SureWash; GLANTA, Dublin, Ireland) was placed on a ward with 45 staff members for two 6-day periods to automatically assess hand hygiene technique and the potential effectiveness of the automated training system. Two human reviewers assessed videos from 50 hand hygiene events with an interrater reliability (IIR) of 88% (44/50). The IIR was 88% (44/50) for the human reviewers and 80% (40/50) for the software. This study also investigated the poses missed and the impact of feedback on participation (+113%), duration (+11%), and technique (+2.23%). Our findings showed significant correlation between the human raters and the computer, demonstrating for the first time in a clinical setting the potential use of this type of AI technology in hand hygiene training."
23055164,Natural language processing in an intelligent writing strategy tutoring system,Danielle S McNamara,"The Writing Pal is an intelligent tutoring system that provides writing strategy training. A large part of its artificial intelligence resides in the natural language processing algorithms to assess essay quality and guide feedback to students. Because writing is often highly nuanced and subjective, the development of these algorithms must consider a broad array of linguistic, rhetorical, and contextual features. This study assesses the potential for computational indices to predict human ratings of essay quality. Past studies have demonstrated that linguistic indices related to lexical diversity, word frequency, and syntactic complexity are significant predictors of human judgments of essay quality but that indices of cohesion are not. The present study extends prior work by including a larger data sample and an expanded set of indices to assess new lexical, syntactic, cohesion, rhetorical, and reading ease indices. Three models were assessed. The model reported by McNamara, Crossley, and McCarthy (Written Communication 27:57-86, 2010) including three indices of lexical diversity, word frequency, and syntactic complexity accounted for only 6% of the variance in the larger data set. A regression model including the full set of indices examined in prior studies of writing predicted 38% of the variance in human scores of essay quality with 91% adjacent accuracy (i.e., within 1 point). A regression model that also included new indices related to rhetoric and cohesion predicted 44% of the variance with 94% adjacent accuracy. The new indices increased accuracy but, more importantly, afford the means to provide more meaningful feedback in the context of a writing tutoring system."
23055121,Individual differences in adult foreign language learning: the mediating effect of metalinguistic awareness,Patricia J Brooks,"In this study, we sought to identify cognitive predictors of individual differences in adult foreign-language learning and to test whether metalinguistic awareness mediated the observed relationships. Using a miniature language-learning paradigm, adults (N = 77) learned Russian vocabulary and grammar (gender agreement and case marking) over six 1-h sessions, completing tasks that encouraged attention to phrases without explicitly teaching grammatical rules. The participants' ability to describe the Russian gender and case-marking patterns mediated the effects of nonverbal intelligence and auditory sequence learning on grammar learning and generalization. Hence, even under implicit-learning conditions, individual differences stemmed from explicit metalinguistic awareness of the underlying grammar, which, in turn, was linked to nonverbal intelligence and auditory sequence learning. Prior knowledge of languages with grammatical gender (predominantly Spanish) predicted learning of gender agreement. Transfer of knowledge of gender from other languages to Russian was not mediated by awareness, which suggests that transfer operates through an implicit process akin to structural priming."
23055118,Metaphorically speaking: cognitive abilities and the production of figurative language,Roger E Beaty,"Figurative language is one of the most common expressions of creative behavior in everyday life. However, the cognitive mechanisms behind figures of speech such as metaphors remain largely unexplained. Recent evidence suggests that fluid and executive abilities are important to the generation of conventional and creative metaphors. The present study investigated whether several factors of the Cattell-Horn-Carroll model of intelligence contribute to generating these different types of metaphors. Specifically, the roles of fluid intelligence (Gf), crystallized intelligence (Gc), and broad retrieval ability (Gr) were explored. Participants completed a series of intelligence tests and were asked to produce conventional and creative metaphors. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the contribution of the different factors of intelligence to metaphor production. For creative metaphor, there were large effects of Gf (β = .45) and Gr (β = .52); for conventional metaphor, there was a moderate effect of Gc (β = .30). Creative and conventional metaphors thus appear to be anchored in different patterns of abilities: Creative metaphors rely more on executive processes, whereas conventional metaphors primarily draw from acquired vocabulary knowledge."
23042644,A novel RAB33B mutation in Smith-McCort dysplasia,Nina Dupuis,"Smith-McCort dysplasia (SMC) is a rare autosomal recessive spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia with skeletal features identical to those of Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome (DMC) but with normal intelligence and no microcephaly. Although both syndromes were shown to result from mutations in the DYM gene, which encodes the Golgi protein DYMECLIN, a few SMC patients remained negative in DYM mutation screening. Recently, autozygosity mapping and exome sequencing in a large SMC family have allowed the identification of a missense mutation in RAB33B, another Golgi protein involved in retrograde transport of Golgi vesicles. Here, we report a novel RAB33B mutation in a second SMC case that leads to a marked reduction of the protein as shown by Western blot and immunofluorescence. These data confirm the genetic heterogeneity of SMC dysplasia and highlight the role of Golgi transport in the pathogenesis of SMC and DMC syndromes."
23042112,Brain volumes in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis in over 18 000 subjects,Sander V Haijma,"Although structural brain alterations in schizophrenia have been demonstrated extensively, their quantitative distribution has not been studied over the last 14 years despite advances in neuroimaging. Moreover, a volumetric meta-analysis has not been conducted in antipsychotic-naive patients. Therefore, meta-analysis on cross-sectional volumetric brain alterations in both medicated and antipsychotic-naive patients was conducted. Three hundred seventeen studies published from September 1, 1998 to January 1, 2012 comprising over 9000 patients were selected for meta-analysis, including 33 studies in antipsychotic-naive patients. In addition to effect sizes, potential modifying factors such as duration of illness, sex composition, current antipsychotic dose, and intelligence quotient matching status of participants were extracted where available. In the sample of medicated schizophrenia patients (n = 8327), intracranial and total brain volume was significantly decreased by 2.0% (effect size d = -0.17) and 2.6% (d = -0.30), respectively. Largest effect sizes were observed for gray matter structures, with effect sizes ranging from -0.22 to -0.58. In the sample of antipsychotic-naive patients (n = 771), volume reductions in caudate nucleus (d = -0.38) and thalamus (d = -0.68) were more pronounced than in medicated patients. White matter volume was decreased to a similar extent in both groups, while gray matter loss was less extensive in antipsychotic-naive patients. Gray matter reduction was associated with longer duration of illness and higher dose of antipsychotic medication at time of scanning. Therefore, brain loss in schizophrenia is related to a combination of (early) neurodevelopmental processes-reflected in intracranial volume reduction-as well as illness progression."
23041620,Structural neurobiological correlates of Mayer-Salovery-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test performance in early course schizophrenia,Jessica A Wojtalik,"Objective: The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) is a key measure of social cognition in schizophrenia that has good psychometric properties and is recommended by the MATRICS committee. As a way to further investigate the validity of the MSCEIT, this study sought to examine the neurobiological correlates of MSCEIT performance in patients with early course schizophrenia. Methods: A total of 51 patients diagnosed with early course, stabilized schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and the MSCEIT. Investigation of the associations between MSCEIT performance and gray matter morphology was examined by conducting voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses across hypothesized social-cognitive regions of interest using automated anatomical labeling in Statistical Parametric Mapping Software, version 5 (SPM5). All VBM analyses utilized general linear models examining gray matter density partitioned images, adjusting for demographic and illness-related confounds. VBM results were then followed up with confirmatory volumetric analyses. Results: Patients with poorer overall and Facilitating, Understanding, and Managing Emotions subscale performances on the MSCEIT showed significantly reduced gray matter density in the left parahippocampal gyrus. Additionally, attenuated performance on the Facilitating and Managing Emotions subscales was significantly associated with reduced right posterior cingulate gray matter density. All associations observed between MSCEIT performance and gray matter density were supported with confirmatory gray matter volumetric analyses, with the exception of the association between the right posterior cingulate and the facilitation of emotions. Conclusion: These findings provide additional evidence for the MSCEIT as a valid social-cognitive measure by elucidating its correlates with neurobiological structures commonly implicated in emotion processing. These findings provide additional biological evidence supporting the use of the MSCEIT in cognitive enhancing clinical trials in schizophrenia."
23038064,Children with phenylketonuria treated early: basic audiological and electrophysiological evaluation,Patrícia Cotta Mancini,"Objectives: Individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) can exhibit deficits in executive functions, intelligence, attention, visual-spatial processing abilities, and efficiency stemming presumably from deficient neurotransmitter synthesis, even when the disorder is diagnosed and treated early. Basic audiological and electrophysiological evaluations were used to examine the peripheral and central auditory pathways of children with early-treated PKU, who followed adequate versus inadequate diets. Results were compared with those of age-matched children without PKU. Design: The control group included 35 children aged 5 to 16 years, and the experimental group included 25 children with classic PKU, all of whom were diagnosed and treated early. The experimental group comprised children of two subgroups, divided according to their dietary control, as follows: 8 children aged 6 to 13 years with adequate diets (group A); 17 children ages 6 to 15 years demonstrating inadequate diets (group B). All participants underwent auditory evaluations, including otoscopy, pure-tone and speech audiometry, immittance testing (tympanometry and assessment of contralateral stapedial reflex thresholds), and evaluations of auditory brainstem and middle latency responses. The demographic variables and audiological examination results were analyzed for all groups. Results among groups and subgroups were compared using analysis of variance with repeated measures to test statistical significance across factors and measures at the p = 0.05 level. Results: Audiometric evaluation revealed results within normal limits for all groups, except for one child from the inadequate diet group, who showed a mild bilateral conductive hearing loss. Results of speech and immittance audiometry suggested the children in group B as having poorer average speech-discrimination scores and higher stapedial reflex thresholds at 4000 Hz. Auditory brainstem response results revealed longer average latencies for waves III and V and greater interaural differences for wave V in group B, although both groups A and B showed longer average latencies for the interpeak interval I-V, compared with the control group. Middle latency responses showed no significant differences in the latencies of the Na and Pa waves or the Na-Pa amplitude for the experimental group, but electrode or ear effects were present in 87.5% of group A and 58.8% of group B. Conclusions: Overall, differences observed tended to be small (by clinical diagnostic standards), yet suggest that children with PKU exhibit some effect of this disorder on the pontine auditory pathway, even when diagnosed/treated early and independent of the appropriateness of diet. It thus seems prudent to follow PKU children with auditory processing assessments to evaluate functional implications of these findings."
23036491,Executive functioning deficits and childhood trauma in juvenile violent offenders in China,Zhili Zou,"A large body of evidence indicates that violent offenders have executive functioning deficits. However, previous studies have not considered childhood trauma, which is likely to influence the executive functioning of violent offenders. The aim of the present study was to compare the difference of executive functioning among juvenile violent offenders, with non-violent offenders and normal controls, and then to analyse whether executive functioning was affected independently of childhood trauma. In addition to using a battery of tests assessing executive functioning including the Intra/Extradimensional Shift Test(IED), the Stockings of Cambridge Test (SOC), and the Spatial Working Memory Test (SWM) from the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Testing Battery (CANTAB), the short form of the Chinese Revision of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-RC) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-28 item Short Form (CTQ) were also used among 107 violent offenders, 107 non-violent offenders and 107 normal controls. Our results showed that both offender groups obtained significantly lower estimated Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores and experienced more childhood trauma than did normal controls. Violent offenders showed impaired executive functioning on tasks of attention set-shifting, working memory and planning. Finally, spatial working memory (SWM) deficits, particularly SWM strategy scores, may be associated with childhood trauma."
23025559,"A knowledge-based theory of rising scores on ""culture-free"" tests",Mark C Fox,"Secular gains in intelligence test scores have perplexed researchers since they were documented by Flynn (1984, 1987). Gains are most pronounced on abstract, so-called culture-free tests, prompting Flynn (2007) to attribute them to problem-solving skills availed by scientifically advanced cultures. We propose that recent-born individuals have adopted an approach to analogy that enables them to infer higher level relations requiring roles that are not intrinsic to the objects that constitute initial representations of items. This proposal is translated into item-specific predictions about differences between cohorts in pass rates and item-response patterns on the Raven's Matrices (Flynn, 1987), a seemingly culture-free test that registers the largest Flynn effect. Consistent with predictions, archival data reveal that individuals born around 1940 are less able to map objects at higher levels of relational abstraction than individuals born around 1990. Polytomous Rasch models verify predicted violations of measurement invariance, as raw scores are found to underestimate the number of analogical rules inferred by members of the earlier cohort relative to members of the later cohort who achieve the same overall score. The work provides a plausible cognitive account of the Flynn effect, furthers understanding of the cognition of matrix reasoning, and underscores the need to consider how test-takers select item responses."
23021014,The neuropsychological profile of children at high risk of developing an eating disorder,R Kothari,"Background: There is a large body of evidence indicating that eating disorders (EDs) are characterized by particular neuropsychological profiles. We aimed to further explore whether impairments in neuropsychological functioning previously found in ED groups are present prior to onset, or are secondary to the disorder. Method This is the first study to explore neuropsychological functioning in children born to a mother with a lifetime ED, who are therefore at high risk of developing an ED, in a large cohort sample. We investigated intelligence and attention at age 8 years (n = 6201) and working memory (WM) and inhibition at age 10 years (6192) in children who are at high risk of developing an ED, compared to children who are not. Results: The children of women with lifetime anorexia nervosa (AN) showed high full-scale and performance IQ, increased WM capacity, better visuo-spatial functioning, and decreased attentional control. The children of women with lifetime bulimia nervosa (BN) showed comparatively poor visuo-spatial functioning. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that high intelligence, increased WM capacity and impaired attentional control might be intermediate phenotypes on the pathway between genetic vulnerability and the development of an ED."
23020641,Executive functions,Adele Diamond,"Executive functions (EFs) make possible mentally playing with ideas; taking the time to think before acting; meeting novel, unanticipated challenges; resisting temptations; and staying focused. Core EFs are inhibition [response inhibition (self-control--resisting temptations and resisting acting impulsively) and interference control (selective attention and cognitive inhibition)], working memory, and cognitive flexibility (including creatively thinking ""outside the box,"" seeing anything from different perspectives, and quickly and flexibly adapting to changed circumstances). The developmental progression and representative measures of each are discussed. Controversies are addressed (e.g., the relation between EFs and fluid intelligence, self-regulation, executive attention, and effortful control, and the relation between working memory and inhibition and attention). The importance of social, emotional, and physical health for cognitive health is discussed because stress, lack of sleep, loneliness, or lack of exercise each impair EFs. That EFs are trainable and can be improved with practice is addressed, including diverse methods tried thus far."
23016855,Exploring patterns of epigenetic information with data mining techniques,Vanessa Aguiar-Pulido,"Data mining, a part of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases process (KDD), is the process of extracting patterns from large data sets by combining methods from statistics and artificial intelligence with database management. Analyses of epigenetic data have evolved towards genome-wide and high-throughput approaches, thus generating great amounts of data for which data mining is essential. Part of these data may contain patterns of epigenetic information which are mitotically and/or meiotically heritable determining gene expression and cellular differentiation, as well as cellular fate. Epigenetic lesions and genetic mutations are acquired by individuals during their life and accumulate with ageing. Both defects, either together or individually, can result in losing control over cell growth and, thus, causing cancer development. Data mining techniques could be then used to extract the previous patterns. This work reviews some of the most important applications of data mining to epigenetics."
23015466,Work-family conflict and job satisfaction: emotional intelligence as a moderator,Yongdong Gao,"The negative impact of work-family conflict (WFC) on employees' well-being and job-related outcomes has attracted much research attention recently. A major gap in the literature is which factors could potentially buffer its negative effect on employees. The present study examined the moderating effect of emotional intelligence on the relationship between WFC and job satisfaction in a sample of 212 Chinese high school teachers. On the basis of conservation of resource theory, we hypothesized that emotional intelligence would weaken the negative effect of family-to-work and work-to-family interference on job satisfaction. Results suggested that WFC (work-to-family interference and family-to-work interference) was negatively related to job satisfaction and that emotional intelligence weakened the effect of WFC on job satisfaction. These findings provide implications for theories on WFC and emotional intelligence, such as conservation of resource theory. The current study also provides a test of these theories in Chinese culture to support the generalizability of theories developed in previous research. Practical implications for reducing the negative influence of WFC on employees' job satisfaction are also provided, such as the potential value of emotional intelligence for the training and development of employees in teaching professions."
23011900,Domain-specific and domain-general constraints on word and sequence learning,Lisa M D Archibald,"The relative influences of language-related and memory-related constraints on the learning of novel words and sequences were examined by comparing individual differences in performance of children with and without specific deficits in either language or working memory. Children recalled lists of words in a Hebbian learning protocol in which occasional lists repeated, yielding improved recall over the course of the task on the repeated lists. The task involved presentation of pictures of common nouns followed immediately by equivalent presentations of the spoken names. The same participants also completed a paired-associate learning task involving word-picture and nonword-picture pairs. Hebbian learning was observed for all groups. Domain-general working memory constrained immediate recall, whereas language abilities impacted recall in the auditory modality only. In addition, working memory constrained paired-associate learning generally, whereas language abilities disproportionately impacted novel word learning. Overall, all of the learning tasks were highly correlated with domain-general working memory. The learning of nonwords was additionally related to general intelligence, phonological short-term memory, language abilities, and implicit learning. The results suggest that distinct associations between language- and memory-related mechanisms support learning of familiar and unfamiliar phonological forms and sequences."
23011383,"Neuropsychological variability, symptoms, and brain imaging in chronic schizophrenia",Paul G Nestor,"We examined variability in performance on widely-used neuropsychological Wechsler tests of intelligence and memory in a large sample of persons with chronic schizophrenia, a subset of whom had also undergone prior studies of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) gray matter and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the cingulum bundle (CB) and the uncinate fasiculus (UF) white matter. In comparison to controls, persons with schizophrenia showed lower scores across neuropsychological tests, with most pronounced drops in processing speed and immediate memory, in relation to oral reading. For patients, greater declines in intelligence and memory each correlated with reduced CB white matter fractional anisotropy and reduced OFC gray matter, respectively. However, only memory decline correlated with severity of negative symptoms. Taken together, these data raise the intriguing question as to whether communication and motivational deficits expressed in negative symptoms may contribute to the relationship of auditory memory decline and OFC volume observed in this patient sample."
23009635,Early risk predictors for impaired numerical skills in 5-year-old children born before 32 weeks of gestation,Ursula Kiechl-Kohlendorfer,"Aim: To unravel risk predictors for impaired numerical skills at 5 years of age in a population-based cohort of very preterm infants. Methods: Between January 2003 and August 2006, we prospectively enrolled all infants born in Tyrol with <32 weeks of gestation. A total of 161 of 223 preterm infants (participation rate 72.2%) had a detailed examination at 5 years of age including cognitive assessment (Hannover-Wechsler Intelligence Test for preschool children, third edition (HAWIVA-III) or Snijders-Oomen Nonverbal Intelligence Test (SON-R)). In 135 children, numerical abilities were assessed with the dyscalculia test TEDI-MATH. The association between pre- and postnatal factors and impaired numerical skills was analyzed by means of logistic regression analysis. Results: Dyscalculia test showed delayed numerical skills (TEDI-MATH Sum T-score <40) in 27 of 135 children tested (20.0%). In half of the children tested, delayed numerical abilities were related to lower IQ scores. Smoking in pregnancy, intracerebral haemorrhage and chronic lung disease were predictive of delayed numerical skills at 5 years of age in the multivariate analysis. Conclusion: This study identified risk predictors for impaired numerical skills in preterm infants. Our data support the role of both pre- and perinatal factors in the evolution of mathematical deficits."
23008156,Functional connectivity between parietal and frontal brain regions and intelligence in young children: the Generation R study,Sandra J E Langeslag,"It has been shown in adults that individual differences in intelligence are related to the integrity of the interaction between parietal and frontal brain regions. Since connectivity between distant brain regions strengthens during childhood, it is unclear when in the course of development this relationship emerges. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine whether parietal-frontal functional connectivity is associated with intelligence in young children. We performed independent component analyses on resting-state fMRI data of 115 children (6-8 years old) to select seed and target regions for a seed/target region correlation analysis. We found that higher nonverbal intelligence was associated with increased functional connectivity between right parietal and right frontal regions, and between right parietal and dorsal anterior cingulate regions. The association between intelligence and functional connectivity between certain brain regions was stronger in girls than boys. In conclusion, we found that connectivity between the parietal and frontal lobes is critically involved in intelligence in young children."
23000532,Lifespan development: the effects of typical aging on theory of mind,Joseph M Moran,"Whether typical aging is associated with impairments in social understanding is a topic of critical importance in characterizing the changes that occur in older adulthood. Theory of mind (ToM) refers to the ability to represent other's mental states, and has been tested in a variety of different paradigms in older adults. The overarching research question has been whether ToM abilities may rely on other cognitive abilities, such as processing speed or executive functioning, and as such declines in ToM may reflect a decline in general meta-representational abilities. Alternatively, ToM abilities may be relatively spared, suggesting the acquisition of a sort of social wisdom with advancing age. The preponderance of the evidence is in line with the first possibility: namely, ToM, as measured by paradigms involving faces, cartoons, stories, and videos is typically impaired in social aging, and these impairments are at least partly mediated by impairments in executive functions and fluid intelligence (but not typically by crystallized intelligence). Neuroimaging investigations suggest that older adults who perform as well as younger adults may activate compensatory mechanisms, but are impaired in the brain mechanisms most closely associated with ToM ability when their task performance is impaired. Recent methodological advances allowing continuous rather than categorical assessment of ToM show that ToM may be observed to function independently from general cognition in aging, but further investigation is needed to confirm this point. Implications of these findings for the longstanding discussion regarding Theory of Mind's endangered status as a special cognitive module are discussed."
22999658,The burden of disease from pediatric lead exposure at hazardous waste sites in 7 Asian countries,Jack Caravanos,"Identification and systematic assessment of hazardous wastes sites in low and middle-income countries has lagged. Hazardous waste problems are especially severe in lower income Asian countries where environmental regulations are non-existent, nonspecific or poorly enforced. In these countries extensive unregulated industrial development has created waste sites in densely populated urban areas. These sites appear to pose significant risks to public health, and especially to the health of children. To assess potential health risks from chemical contamination at hazardous waste sites in Asia, we assessed 679 sites. A total of 169 sites in 7 countries were classified as contaminated by lead. Eighty-two of these sites contained lead at levels high enough to produce elevated blood lead levels in surrounding populations. To estimate the burden of pediatric lead poisoning associated with exposure to lead in soil and water at these 82 lead-contaminated sites, we used standard toxicokinetic models that relate levels of lead in soil and water to blood lead levels in children. We calculated blood lead levels, and we quantified losses of intelligence (reductions in IQ scores) that were attributable to lead exposure at these sites. We found that 189,725 children in the 7 countries are at risk of diminished intelligence as a consequence of exposure to elevated levels of lead in water and soil at hazardous waste sites. Depending on choice of model, these decrements ranged from 4.94 to 14.96 IQ points. Given the restricted scope of this survey and the conservative estimation procedures employed, this number is almost certainly an underestimate of the full burden of disease. Exposure to toxic chemicals from hazardous waste sites is an important and heretofore insufficiently examined contributor to the Global Burden of Disease."
22999439,The influence of impaired processing speed on cognition in first-episode antipsychotic-naïve schizophrenic patients,R Andersen,"Background: Impaired cognition is a prominent feature of schizophrenia. To what extent the heterogeneous cognitive impairments can be accounted for by considering only a single underlying impairment or a small number of core impairments remains elusive. This study examined whether cognitive impairments in antipsychotic-naïve, first-episode schizophrenia patients may be determined by a relative slower speed of information processing. Method: Forty-eight antipsychotic-naïve patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 48 matched healthy controls were administered a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests to assess domains of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. Composite scores were calculated, grouping tests into cognitive domains. Results: There were significant differences between patients and healthy controls on global cognition and all cognitive domains, including verbal intelligence, processing speed, sustained attention, working memory, reasoning and problem solving, verbal learning and memory, visual learning and memory, and reaction time. All these significant differences, except for verbal intelligence and global cognition, disappeared when processing speed was included as a covariate. Conclusion: At the first stage of illness, antipsychotic-naïve patients with schizophrenia display moderate/severe impairments in all the cognitive domains assessed. The results support the contention of a global cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia that to some extent may be determined by impaired processing speed."
22998842,"Towards an integrative approach to understanding quality of life in schizophrenia: the role of neurocognition, social cognition, and psychopathology",Cumhur Tas,"The term ""schizophrenia"" refers to a debilitating group of disorders that usually results in a severely impaired quality of life (QoL). Symptomatology appears to have a substantial role in determining QoL, although the relationship between QoL and specific psychotic symptoms is still unclear and has demonstrated mixed results. Due to the intrinsic importance of social functioning in QoL, and the mediating effect of social cognition on social functioning, the aim of this study was to try to investigate QoL in schizophrenia, not only in terms of symptomatology, but also in consideration of potential neurocognitive and social cognitive contributing factors. Methods: Twenty-eight clinically stable patients with schizophrenia performed a broad range of neurocognitive and social cognitive assessments, and also participated in a semi-structured interview of QoL, assessing four partially independent subdomains of QoL. A stepwise regression model was used to determine the best predictors of QoL, and additionally a mediator analysis was performed to test for the mediating power of social cognition on QoL. Results: Negative symptoms, intelligence, executive functioning and social cognition all had some power in predicting QoL in schizophrenia. Though most interestingly, mental state reasoning was specifically found to be most strongly related with the Intrapsychic Foundation subdomain of QoL, whereas neurocognition and symptom severity were associated with other subdomains of QoL. Conclusions: The association between mental state reasoning and the more ""internal"" aspects of QoL in schizophrenia may reflect a specific role for social cognition in introspective and subjective judgments of one's own QoL, whereas neurocognition and negative symptomatology may be more predictive of the external or extrinsic aspects of QoL. In conclusion, social cognitive skills appear to play a crucial role in the experience of one's own subjective well-being, which could help to explain previous inconsistencies in the literature investigating QoL in schizophrenia."
22998594,Predictors of self-injurious behaviour exhibited by individuals with autism spectrum disorder,D M Richman,"Background: Presence of an autism spectrum disorder is a risk factor for development of self-injurious behaviour (SIB) exhibited by individuals with developmental disorders. The most salient SIB risk factors historically studied within developmental disorders are level of intellectual disability, communication deficits and presence of specific genetic disorders. Recent SIB research has expanded the search for risk factors to include less commonly studied variables for people with developmental disorders: negative affect, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Method: A heterogeneous sample of 617 individuals with autism spectrum disorder diagnoses was derived from the National Database of Autism Research. Latent constructs were estimated from items of the community version of the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist. Structural equation modelling was used to assess whether impulsivity, hyperactivity, negative affect, severity of stereotypy, intellectual functioning or severity of autism symptoms predicted severity of SIB. Results: Impulsivity (β = 0.46), followed by intellectual functioning (β = -0.39), and stereotypy (β = 0.23) were the variables most highly predictive of increased SIB; impulsivity and stereotypy remained significant predictors of SIB after severity of autism symptoms and intelligence quotient (IQ) were controlled for. Conclusions: High levels of impulsivity and stereotypy were significant predictors of SIB in a large and diverse sample of people with confirmed autism diagnoses. Future research is needed on the effects of reducing impulsivity and stereotypy on the outcomes of treatment, early intervention and attempts to prevent the development of SIB."
22987890,Diseases of the gastrointestinal tract in individuals diagnosed as children with atypical autism: a Danish register study based on hospital diagnoses,Svend Erik Mouridsen,"The purpose of this study is to compare the prevalence and types of diseases (International classification of mental and behavioural disorders, 10th edition codes K20-K93) relating to the gastrointestinal tract in a clinical sample of 89 individuals diagnosed as children with atypical autism/pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified with 258 controls from the general population. All participants were screened through the nationwide Danish National Hospital Register. The average observation time was 32.9 years, and mean age at the end of the observation period was 48.5 years. Among the 89 cases with atypical autism, a total of 22 (24.7%) were registered with at least one diagnosis of any disease of the gastrointestinal tract, against 47 of 258 (18.2%) in the comparison group (p = 0.22; odds ratio = 1.5; 95% confidence interval = 0.8-2.6). Without reaching statistical significance, the rate of diseases of the gastrointestinal tract was particularly high (odds ratio = 1.2) in those with intelligence quotient < 70. Overall, people with atypical autism had about the same frequency of gastric, intestinal and hepatic diseases as had controls."
22985548,Working memory as a predictor of negative symptoms and functional outcome in first episode psychosis,Itxaso González-Ortega,"The relationship of neurocognitive course with clinical and functional outcomes in psychosis is not well known, especially in the long term. The aim of the study was to examine the clinical and neuropsychological course of first-episode psychosis patients at 5-year follow-up and analyze the relationship of cognitive performance with clinical and functional outcome. The 5-year follow-up was conducted with 26 first-episode psychosis patients. Psychotic symptoms were measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, manic and depressive symptoms by the Young Mania Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale respectively, and psychosocial functioning by the Functioning Assessment Short Test. The cognitive domains were assessed by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the Trail Making Test, the Verbal Fluency Test, the Stroop Colour-Word Test and the Wechsler Memory Scale. Patients showed symptomatic improvement in the follow-up except in negative psychotic symptoms. There was also improvement in most cognitive domains except in working memory and processing speed in the follow-up. Working memory impairment was associated to negative psychotic symptoms and poor functional outcomes. Negative symptoms mediated the relationship between working memory and outcome. Therefore, negative symptoms should be a primary target of treatment to improve functional outcomes."
22984802,Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis of U.S. and Italian children's performance on the PASS theory of intelligence as measured by the Cognitive Assessment System,Jack A Naglieri,"This study examined Italian and U.S. children's performance on the English and Italian versions, respectively, of the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS; Naglieri & Conway, 2009; Naglieri & Das, 1997), a test based on a neurocognitive theory of intelligence entitled PASS (Planning, Attention, Simultaneous, and Successive; Naglieri & Das, 1997; Naglieri & Otero, 2011). CAS subtest, PASS scales, and Full Scale scores for Italian (N=809) and U.S. (N=1,174) samples, matched by age and gender, were examined. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis results supported the configural invariance of the CAS factor structure between Italians and Americans for the 5- to 7-year-old (root-mean-square error of approximation [RMSEA]=.038; 90% confidence interval [CI]=.033, .043; comparative fit index [CFI]=.96) and 8- to 18-year-old (RMSEA=.036; 90% CI=.028, .043; CFI=.97) age groups. The Full Scale standard scores (using the U.S. norms) for the Italian (100.9) and U.S. (100.5) samples were nearly identical. The scores between the samples for the PASS scales were very similar, except for the Attention Scale (d=0.26), where the Italian sample's mean score was slightly higher. Negligible mean differences were found for 9 of the 13 subtest scores, 3 showed small d-ratios (2 in favor of the Italian sample), and 1 was large (in favor of the U.S. sample), but some differences in subtest variances were found. These findings suggest that the PASS theory, as measured by CAS, yields similar mean scores and showed factorial invariance for these samples of Italian and American children, who differ on cultural and linguistic characteristics."
22975250,Early motor developmental milestones and level of neuroticism in young adulthood: a 23-year follow-up study of the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort,T Flensborg-Madsen,"Background: Studies investigating early developmental factors in relation to psychopathology have mainly focused on schizophrenia. The personality dimension of neuroticism seems to be a general risk factor for psychopathology, but evidence on associations between early developmental precursors and personality traits is almost non-existent. This study is therefore the first to investigate associations between early motor developmental milestones and neuroticism in adulthood. Method Mothers of 9125 children of the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort recorded 12 developmental milestones during the child's first year of life. A subsample of the cohort comprising 1182 individuals participated in a follow-up when they were aged 20-34 years and were administered the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). Associations between motor developmental milestones and level of neuroticism, extraversion and psychoticism were analysed by multiple linear regression adjusting for for sex, single-mother status, parity, mother's age, father's age, parental social status and birth weight. Results: Among the 1182 participants with information on the EPQ, information on milestones was available for 968 participants. Infants who developed high levels of neuroticism as adults tended to sit without support, crawl, and walk with and without support significantly later than individuals with low levels of neuroticism (p values <0.05). These results remained significant after adjustment for the included covariates and for adult intelligence. Conclusions: The findings are the first of their kind and suggest that delays in early motor development may not only characterize psychopathological disorders such as schizophrenia, but may also be associated with the personality dimension of neuroticism in adulthood."
22974268,Systems and cascades in cognitive development and academic achievement,Marc H Bornstein,"A large-scale (N = 552) controlled multivariate prospective 14-year longitudinal study of a developmental cascade embedded in a developmental system showed that information-processing efficiency in infancy (4 months), general mental development in toddlerhood (18 months), behavior difficulties in early childhood (36 months), psychometric intelligence in middle childhood (8 years), and maternal education either directly or indirectly (or both) contribute to academic achievement in adolescence (14 years)."
22962852,Associations between higher-level competence and general intelligence in community-dwelling older adults,Shingo Moriya,"Objectives: Higher-level competence is crucial for healthy and socially independent living, and general intelligence may underlie heath status. The aim of this study was to elucidate associations between general intelligence and higher-level competence in elderly individuals without dementia. Methods: A total of 207 community-dwelling elderly persons, aged 70-74 years, were enrolled. A personal interview was performed to obtain data on socio-demographic and medical factors; higher-level competence was evaluated using the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology index of competence (TMIG index). Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) test was used to assess general intelligence. Correlations between the TMIG index, its subscale scores and the RCPM score were evaluated by Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Ordinal regression models were conducted with the TMIG index and its subscales as the dependent variables, RCPM as the principal independent variable, and age, sex, type of household, employment status, educational background, chronic medical conditions and number of natural teeth as the potential independent variables. Results: There were significant but weak positive correlations between total score on the TMIG index, scores on the intellectual activity and social role subscales and RCPM score. In ordinal regression models, RCPM and educational background were significantly associated with total score on the TMIG index and the intellectual activity subscale, and only RCPM was associated with the social role subscale score, after adjusting for other potential variables. Conclusion: General intelligence may be significantly associated with higher-level competence, especially with intellectual activity and social role subscales, in community-dwelling older adults."
22950806,Development of an eight-subtest short form of the WISC-IV and evaluation of its clinical utility in children with traumatic brain injury,Jacobus Donders,"This study evaluated the degree to which an 8-subtest short form of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children--Fourth Edition would yield acceptable estimates of the long-form Full-Scale IQ index while clarifying the underlying factor structure in a sample of 100 children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury. The short-form Full-Scale IQ had sufficient (i.e., at least two thirds) nonerror covariance with its full-length counterpart. In addition, a sufficient proportion (i.e., > 80%) of these short-form estimates fell within the 90% confidence interval of the respective full-length scores. Importantly, the elimination of 2 subtests, and in particular the Picture Concepts subtest, resulted in a factor structure where each remaining subtest was fairly specifically associated with its intended scale. It is concluded that this short form can be used clinically in children with traumatic brain injury without sacrificing reliability and with more straightforward interpretability at the level of the factor index scores."
22946644,Malawian secondary students' beliefs about intelligence,Brett D Jones,"Students who view intelligence as malleable tend to be more academically motivated and perform at higher levels than students who view it as a fixed trait. We examined the beliefs of students from Malawi because the culture and schooling process in this country is very different from some other areas of the world in which students' views of intelligence have already been studied. Our research questions were: (1) How do Malawian students define intelligence? (2) To what extent do Malawian students view intelligence as malleable? (3) Are Malawian students' definitions of intelligence and beliefs about the malleability of intelligence similar to those of students in more developed countries? We conducted a mixed methods study and surveyed 136 students attending a secondary school in Malawi using a 39-item questionnaire. Students responded to questions about their intelligence beliefs on open- and closed-ended items. Our results showed that Malawian students believe that an intelligent student exhibits a variety of behaviors, including studying, working hard, reading, performing well on exams and in class, answering and asking questions, paying attention, and demonstrating good behavior. Most students believe that intelligence is malleable and provided responses that indicated that students can become more intelligent through effort. When compared to the findings of other studies, the present results suggest that the Malawian students who remain in secondary school have definitions of intelligence and beliefs about the malleability of intelligence that are similar to those of students in more developed countries, such as the US and Germany. In fact, it appears that Malawian secondary students have even higher malleable beliefs than American and German students. Finally, some of the measures that have been found to produce scores that are reliable and valid in other populations do not produce scores that are as reliable when used with Malawian students."
22946438,The typical developmental trajectory of social and executive functions in late adolescence and early adulthood,Sophie Jane Taylor,"Executive functions and social cognition develop through childhood into adolescence and early adulthood and are important for adaptive goal-oriented behavior (Apperly, Samson, & Humphreys, 2009; Blakemore & Choudhury, 2006). These functions are attributed to frontal networks known to undergo protracted maturation into early adulthood (Barker, Andrade, Morton, Romanowski, & Bowles, 2010; Lebel, Walker, Leemans, Phillips, & Beaulieu, 2008), although social cognition functions are also associated with widely distributed networks. Previously, nonlinear development has been reported around puberty on an emotion match-to-sample task (McGivern, Andersen, Byrd, Mutter, & Reilly, 2002) and for IQ in midadolescence (Ramsden et al., 2011). However, there are currently little data on the typical development of social and executive functions in late adolescence and early adulthood. In a cross-sectional design, 98 participants completed tests of social cognition and executive function, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (Wechsler, 1999), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983), and measures of pubertal development and demographics at ages 17, 18, and 19. Nonlinear age differences for letter fluency and concept formation executive functions were found, with a trough in functional ability in 18-year-olds compared with other groups. There were no age group differences on social cognition measures. Gender accounted for differences on 1 scale of concept formation, 1 dynamic social interaction scale, and 2 empathy scales. The clinical, developmental, and educational implications of these findings are discussed."
22945857,Cognitive functioning in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients and its medical correlates: a prospective multicenter study,Angela Scherwath,"Background: Owing to its neurotoxicity, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) carries risks for cognitive impairment. In this multicenter study, we prospectively evaluated cognitive functioning and its medical and demographic correlates in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. Methods: A total of 102 patients were consecutively assessed prior to (T0 ), 100 ± 20 days (T1 ) after, and 12 ± 1 months (T2 ) after HSCT (61% men, 41% acute myeloid leukemia). A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery was applied to evaluate attention, memory, executive function, and fine motor function, summing up into 14 test scores. Results: Before and after HSCT, patients performed below test norms in up to 50% of the test scores. Patients were mostly impaired on word fluency (24%, T0 ), fine motor function, and verbal delayed recall (19% each, T2 ). Impairment on ≥ 1/5 cognitive domains occurred in 47% (T0 ) and 41% (T2 ) of the patients. Performance (mean z-scores) partially improved over time (i.e., visual span forward, verbal learning, and word fluency). However, from baseline to T2 , 16% of the patients showed reliable decline on ≥ 3/14 test scores (reliable change index method). For the majority of neuropsychological subtests, no associations with conditioning intensity, total body irradiation, graft-versus-host disease, cyclosporine treatment, and length of hospital stay were found. Age and premorbid intelligence level were consistently associated with cognition. Conclusions: Below average cognitive performance is common in this patient group. In addition, a subgroup shows reliable cognitive decline after allogeneic HSCT. Healthcare professionals should be aware of these treatment-related cognitive side effects."
22934576,"Behaviour in children with neurofibromatosis type 1: cognition, executive function, attention, emotion, and social competence",Annukka Lehtonen,"Aim: This systematic review aimed to pull together the findings from research into behavioural systems and attention in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and to identify areas that need further study. Method: Relevant papers were identified through searches of electronic databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE) and manual searches through reference lists. In total, 5746 articles were identified and 57 met the inclusion criteria. The data were synthesized using the narrative approach, as the studies varied considerably in terms of participants and measures. Results: The results of the review showed that intelligence, academic skills, visuospatial skills, social competence, and attention are impaired in children with NF1. Evidence of deficits in memory, motor functioning, language, and executive functions was less clear. Interpretation: Research has made marked progress in outlining the behavioural phenotype of NF1. However, although the general areas of impairment are becoming better known, the exact nature of the impairment is still not understood in many areas of behaviour. Care needs to be taken with the way in which behavioural constructs are defined and measured, and the variability of problems in NF1 is a particular challenge. Nevertheless, research is steadily moving towards comprehensive understanding of behaviour in children with NF1."
22917843,"The association of quality of social relations, symptom severity and intelligence with anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorders",Mart L J M Eussen,"Limited quality of social relations, milder symptom severity and higher intelligence were shown to account for higher anxiety levels in autism spectrum disorders. The current study replicated and extended earlier findings by combining these three determinants of anxiety in autism spectrum disorders in one study. The sample consisted of 134 school-aged children with autism spectrum disorders, of whom 58 (43%) had a co-morbid anxiety disorder according to the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Parent version. In this sample, we tested associations between these determinants and anxiety univariately and multivariately to clarify the unique contribution of all determinants. Since we hypothesized that the association between limited quality of social relations and anxiety would be amplified by low symptom severity and/or high intelligence, we additionally tested for moderating effects. We found that higher anxiety levels were associated with a lower quality of social relations and lower symptom severity. In this mainly high-functioning sample, intelligence was not related to anxiety levels. No moderation effects were found. Since lower quality of social relations and lower symptom severity are associated with higher anxiety levels in children with autism spectrum disorders, therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing anxiety in autism spectrum disorders should pay attention to improving social relations, and presumably children with a lower symptom severity could benefit most from such interventions."
22917817,The HIrisPlex system for simultaneous prediction of hair and eye colour from DNA,Susan Walsh,"Recently, the field of predicting phenotypes of externally visible characteristics (EVCs) from DNA genotypes with the final aim of concentrating police investigations to find persons completely unknown to investigating authorities, also referred to as Forensic DNA Phenotyping (FDP), has started to become established in forensic biology. We previously developed and forensically validated the IrisPlex system for accurate prediction of blue and brown eye colour from DNA, and recently showed that all major hair colour categories are predictable from carefully selected DNA markers. Here, we introduce the newly developed HIrisPlex system, which is capable of simultaneously predicting both hair and eye colour from DNA. HIrisPlex consists of a single multiplex assay targeting 24 eye and hair colour predictive DNA variants including all 6 IrisPlex SNPs, as well as two prediction models, a newly developed model for hair colour categories and shade, and the previously developed IrisPlex model for eye colour. The HIrisPlex assay was designed to cope with low amounts of template DNA, as well as degraded DNA, and preliminary sensitivity testing revealed full DNA profiles down to 63pg input DNA. The power of the HIrisPlex system to predict hair colour was assessed in 1551 individuals from three different parts of Europe showing different hair colour frequencies. Using a 20% subset of individuals, while 80% were used for model building, the individual-based prediction accuracies employing a prediction-guided approach were 69.5% for blond, 78.5% for brown, 80% for red and 87.5% for black hair colour on average. Results from HIrisPlex analysis on worldwide DNA samples imply that HIrisPlex hair colour prediction is reliable independent of bio-geographic ancestry (similar to previous IrisPlex findings for eye colour). We furthermore demonstrate that it is possible to infer with a prediction accuracy of >86% if a brown-eyed, black-haired individual is of non-European (excluding regions nearby Europe) versus European (including nearby regions) bio-geographic origin solely from the strength of HIrisPlex eye and hair colour probabilities, which can provide extra intelligence for future forensic applications. The HIrisPlex system introduced here, including a single multiplex test assay, an interactive tool and prediction guide, and recommendations for reporting final outcomes, represents the first tool for simultaneously establishing categorical eye and hair colour of a person from DNA. The practical forensic application of the HIrisPlex system is expected to benefit cases where other avenues of investigation, including STR profiling, provide no leads on who the unknown crime scene sample donor or the unknown missing person might be."
22915146,Determinants of cognitive development of low SES children in Chile: a post-transitional country with rising childhood obesity rates,Marcos Galván,"Studies conducted in developing countries have noted associations between concurrent stunting, social-emotional problems and poor cognitive ability in young children. However, the relative contribution of these variables in Latin America is likely changing as undernutrition rates decline and prevalence of childhood obesity rises. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 106 normal-weight and 109 obese preschool children to compare the relative contribution of early nutrition, sociodemographic factors and psychosocial variables on cognitive development in normal-weight and obese preschool children in Chile. The study variables were categorized as: (1) socio-demographic (age, sex, birth order and socioeconomic) (2) early nutrition (maternal height, birth weight, birth length and height at 5 years) (3) psychosocial factors (maternal depression, social-emotional wellbeing and home space sufficiency). In order to assess determinants of cognitive development at 4-5 years we measured intelligence quotient (IQ); variability in normal children was mostly explained by socio-demographic characteristics (r(2) = 0.26), while in obese children early nutritional factors had a significant effect (r(2) = 0.12) beyond socio-demographic factors (r(2) = 0.19). Normal-weight children, who were first born, of slightly better SES and height Z score >1, had an IQ ≥ 6 points greater than their counterparts (p < 0.05). Obese children who were first born with birth weight >4,000 g and low risk of socio-emotional problems had on average ≥5 IQ points greater than their peers (p < 0.05). We conclude that in Chile, a post-transitional country, IQ variability of normal children was mostly explained by socio-demographic characteristics; while in obese children, early nutrition also played a significant role."
22911964,Multiple system morbidities associated with children with snore symptom,Xiao-Hong Cai,"Objective: To exam the relationship between snoring and morbidities of multiple systems in children. Study design: Children with snoring were enrolled and divided into primary snorer (PS) group and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) group based on polysomnography. The healthy children served as the control group. The growth parameters, maxillofacial malformations, blood chemistry, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram were recorded and intelligence testing was performed in the enrolled children who were ≥6 years old. Results: The weight and height were similar in the control group (n = 60) and the PS group (n = 63), but lower in the OSAHS group (n = 89; P < 0.001). Occurrence of adenoidal face and dental malocclusion in the OSAHS and the PS group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.001). Compared with the control group, the OSAHS group had a lower serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level; and a possible higher pulmonary artery pressure based on the echocardiogram (P < 0.001). All the above parameters in the PS group were similar to those in the control group. Full-scale IQ and performance IQ of the OSAHS group was lower (P < 0.001), attention deficits were significantly higher in the OSAHS group (P < 0.001), but were similar in the PS group when compared to the control group. Conclusions: OSAHS in children is associated with delayed growth, maxillofacial malformations, impaired cognitive functions, abnormalities in lipid metabolism, and changes in pulmonary artery pressures. PS children also have higher incidence of maxillofacial malformations but have a normal growth and normal cognitive functions."
22909445,Morphometric differences in central stress-regulating structures between women with and without borderline personality disorder,Andrea Kuhlmann,"Background: Experiences of early life stress, increased psychological arousal and the body's physiologic stress response seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis and maintenance of borderline personality disorder (BPD). In the present study, we investigated alterations in grey matter of central stress-regulating structures in female patients with BPD. Methods: We examined T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans of unmedicated, right-handed female patients with BPD (according to DSM-IV criteria) and healthy controls matched for age, intelligence and education using fully automated DARTEL voxel-based morphometry. Our regions of interest analyses included the hippocampus, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hypothalamus. Results: We enrolled 30 patients and 33 controls in our study. The grey matter of patients with BPD was reduced in the hippocampus, but increased in the hypothalamus compared with healthy participants. Hypothalamic volume correlated positively with the history of traumatization in patients with BPD. No significant alterations were found in the amygdala and ACC. Limitations: This study is limited by the lack of measures of corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels. Furthermore, moderate sample size and comorbid disorders need to be considered. Conclusion: Our findings provide new evidence for grey matter alterations in the hypothalamus and replicate previously reported decrements in hippocampal volume in patients with BPD. Understanding the role of the hypothalamus and other central stress-regulating structures could help us to further understand the neurobiological underpinnings of this complex disorder."
22905949,The impact of pretend play on children's development: a review of the evidence,Angeline S Lillard,"Pretend play has been claimed to be crucial to children's healthy development. Here we examine evidence for this position versus 2 alternatives: Pretend play is 1 of many routes to positive developments (equifinality), and pretend play is an epiphenomenon of other factors that drive development. Evidence from several domains is considered. For language, narrative, and emotion regulation, the research conducted to date is consistent with all 3 positions but insufficient to draw conclusions. For executive function and social skills, existing research leans against the crucial causal position but is insufficient to differentiate the other 2. For reasoning, equifinality is definitely supported, ruling out a crucially causal position but still leaving open the possibility that pretend play is epiphenomenal. For problem solving, there is no compelling evidence that pretend play helps or is even a correlate. For creativity, intelligence, conservation, and theory of mind, inconsistent correlational results from sound studies and nonreplication with masked experimenters are problematic for a causal position, and some good studies favor an epiphenomenon position in which child, adult, and environment characteristics that go along with play are the true causal agents. We end by considering epiphenomenalism more deeply and discussing implications for preschool settings and further research in this domain. Our take-away message is that existing evidence does not support strong causal claims about the unique importance of pretend play for development and that much more and better research is essential for clarifying its possible role."
22903808,Neuropsychological profile of adult patients with nonsymptomatic occipital lobe epilepsies,Leonilda Bilo,"To explore the neuropsychological and neurobehavioral profile in adult patients affected by nonsymptomatic (cryptogenic and idiopathic) occipital lobe epilepsy (OLE), with normal intelligence, we enrolled 20 adult patients with nonsymptomatic OLE and 20 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy subjects. All participants underwent neuropsychiatric assessment scales, and standardized neuropsychological tests tapping memory, executive functions, constructional, visuospatial and visuoperceptual skills. After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, patients performed significantly worse than controls on several tests tapping complex visuospatial skills and frontal lobe functions. The analysis of single patients' performance revealed that a significantly higher number of OLE patients achieved age- and education-adjusted pathological scores on three tests (Benton Judgment of Line Orientation Test, Freehand Copying of Drawings Test, color-word interference task of Stroop test) with respect to controls. Patients did not differ from control subjects on neuropsychiatric aspects. The direct comparison between OLE subtypes showed that cryptogenetic OLE patients tended to achieve lower scores than idiopathic OLE patients on most tests, but no difference between the two groups was fully significant. In summary, patients with nonsymptomatic OLE can be affected by clinically relevant impairments in selected neuropsychological domains: complex visuospatial skills and executive functions. It could be speculated that frontal and visuospatial cognitive deficits might be the result of epileptic activity spreading within a neural network that includes structures far beyond the occipital lobe."
22899798,Global cerebral and regional multimodal neuroimaging markers of the neurobiology of autism: development and cognition,Khader M Hasan,"Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the microstructure and macrostructure in children with autism report contradictory results due, in part, to the autistic population heterogeneity from factors such as variation in intellect and inadequately accounting for age-related changes in brain development. In this report, the authors compared global and regional volumetry, relaxometry, anisotropy, and diffusometry of gray and white matter in 10 autism spectrum disorder children relative to the age-related trajectories obtained from 38 typically developing controls while controlling for nonverbal intellect using a validated quantitative MRI method. The normalized hippocampus volume increased with age in both autistic and typically developing individuals with limbic structures larger in autistic patients. Hippocampus volume, but not diffusivity or relaxation time, was larger in autistic children. Hippocampus volume was inversely correlated with nonverbal intellect across control individuals. The pattern of hippocampal abnormalities suggests a disturbance in early brain development in autistic children independent of intellect."
22894768,Disturbed microstructural integrity of the frontostriatal fiber pathways and executive dysfunction in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,C Y Shang,"Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is recognized as an early-onset neuropsychiatric disorder with executive dysfunctions and neurobiological deficits. The authors compared executive functions and microstructural integrity of the frontostriatal circuit in children with ADHD and typically developing children. Method We assessed 25 children with ADHD and 25 age-, sex-, handedness- and intelligence-matched typically developing children by using psychiatric interviews, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - third edition, and the tasks involving executive functions in the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. The frontostriatal tracts were reconstructed by diffusion spectrum imaging tractography and were subdivided into four functionally distinct segments, including dorsolateral, medial prefrontal, orbitofrontal and ventrolateral tracts. Tract-specific and matched case-control analyses were used and generalized fractional anisotropy values were computed. Results: Children with ADHD had lower generalized fractional anisotropy of all the bilateral frontostriatal fiber tracts and poorer performance in verbal and spatial working memory, set-shifting, sustained attention, cognitive inhibition and visuospatial planning. The symptom severity of ADHD and the executive functioning performance significantly correlated with integrity of the frontostriatal tracts, particularly the left orbitofrontal and ventrolateral tracts. Children with ADHD also demonstrated loss of the leftward asymmetry in the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal tracts that was present in typically developing children. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate disturbed structural connectivity of the frontostriatal circuitry in children with ADHD and add new evidence of associations between integrity of the frontostriatal tracts and measures of core symptoms of ADHD and a wide range of executive dysfunctions in both groups."
22893439,Rminimax: An Optimally Randomized MINIMAX Algorithm,Silvia García Díez,"This paper proposes a simple extension of the celebrated MINIMAX algorithm used in zero-sum two-player games, called Rminimax. The Rminimax algorithm allows controlling the strength of an artificial rival by randomizing its strategy in an optimal way. In particular, the randomized shortest-path framework is applied for biasing the artificial intelligence (AI) adversary toward worse or better solutions, therefore controlling its strength. In other words, our model aims at introducing/implementing bounded rationality to the MINIMAX algorithm. This framework takes into account all possible strategies by computing an optimal tradeoff between exploration (quantified by the entropy spread in the tree) and exploitation (quantified by the expected cost to an end game) of the game tree. As opposed to other tree-exploration techniques, this new algorithm considers complete paths of a tree (strategies) where a given entropy is spread. The optimal randomized strategy is efficiently computed by means of a simple recurrence relation while keeping the same complexity as the original MINIMAX. As a result, the Rminimax implements a nondeterministic strength-adapted AI opponent for board games in a principled way, thus avoiding the assumption of complete rationality.

22889391,"""Life stage-specific"" variations in performance in response to age stereotypes",Jessica A Hehman,"In a test of life stage-specific responses to age-based stigma, older (n = 54, ages 62-92) and younger (n = 81, ages 17-22) adults were told that a task (Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale-III block design) required either (a) speed/contemporary knowledge (YA; ""youth advantage"") or (b) life experience/wisdom (OA; ""age advantage""). In order to investigate the role of individuals' own perceptual biases in response to age-based stigma, participants also completed a measure of perceived personal control of their life outcomes. Older adults showed lower performance on the task as a result of the additive effects of (a) exposure to a negative age-relevant stereotype and (b) being under the perceived control of others. Younger adults, however, showed higher performance on the task as a result of exposure to a negative age-relevant stereotype (a stereotype challenge effect, disconfirming the stereotype)-but only if they saw themselves under the control of powerful others. The opposed responses of the 2 age groups are interpreted as reflecting (a) differences in the permanence of their group membership and (b) uniqueness of age-based stigma. To our knowledge, this is the first test of the effects of age-relevant stereotypes on younger adults."
22884611,Objective and subjective cognitive enhancing effects of mixed amphetamine salts in healthy people,Irena Ilieva,"Psychostimulants such as mixed amphetamine salts (MAS, brand name Adderall) are widely used for cognitive enhancement by healthy young people, yet laboratory research on effectiveness has yielded variable results. The present study assessed the effects of MAS in healthy young adults with an adequately powered double-blind cross-over placebo-controlled trial. We examined effects in 13 measures of cognitive ability including episodic memory, working memory, inhibitory control, convergent creativity, intelligence and scholastic achievement, with the goals of determining (1) whether the drug is at least moderately enhancing (Cohen's d >= .5) to some or all cognitive abilities tested, (2) whether its effects on cognition are moderated by baseline ability or COMT genotype, and (3) whether it induces an illusory perception of cognitive enhancement. The results did not reveal enhancement of any cognitive abilities by MAS for participants in general. There was a suggestion of moderation of enhancement by baseline ability and COMT genotype in a minority of tasks, with MAS enhancing lower ability participants on word recall, embedded figures and Raven's Progressive Matrices. Despite the lack of enhancement observed for most measures and most participants, participants nevertheless believed their performance was more enhanced by the active capsule than by placebo. We conclude that MAS has no more than small effects on cognition in healthy young adults, although users may perceive the drug as enhancing their cognition. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'."
22881350,A quality by design approach using artificial intelligence techniques to control the critical quality attributes of ramipril tablets manufactured by wet granulation,Buket Aksu,"Quality by design (QbD) is an essential part of the modern approach to pharmaceutical quality. This study was conducted in the framework of a QbD project involving ramipril tablets. Preliminary work included identification of the critical quality attributes (CQAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs) based on the quality target product profiles (QTPPs) using the historical data and risk assessment method failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA). Compendial and in-house specifications were selected as QTPPs for ramipril tablets. CPPs that affected the product and process were used to establish an experimental design. The results thus obtained can be used to facilitate definition of the design space using tools such as design of experiments (DoE), the response surface method (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The project was aimed at discovering hidden knowledge associated with the manufacture of ramipril tablets using a range of artificial intelligence-based software, with the intention of establishing a multi-dimensional design space that ensures consistent product quality. At the end of the study, a design space was developed based on the study data and specifications, and a new formulation was optimized. On the basis of this formulation, a new laboratory batch formulation was prepared and tested. It was confirmed that the explored formulation was within the design space."
22875098,Paired associate learning in children with neurofibromatosis type 1: implications for clinical trials,Jonathan M Payne,"Studies investigating behavior in mice with a heterozygous null mutation of the NF1 gene (Nf1 (+/-)) have provided critical insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Hyperactivation of the Ras-MAPK signaling cascade, which results in increased GABA-mediated inhibition and significantly reduced long-term potentiation, has been proposed as a core mechanism underlying Nf1 (+/-) mice deficits in visuospatial learning and attention. This assertion has been reinforced by preclinical trials that reveal that these impairments can be rescued both at a cognitive and cellular level. We attempted to demonstrate a phenotypic parallel between Nf1 (+/-) mice and children with NF1 using a well-validated measure of visuospatial learning. Children with NF1 (n = 71) and healthy controls (n = 29) were assessed on a computerized paired associate learning task. Interrelationships between visuospatial learning and other cognitive abilities that may influence performance, such as intelligence, attention and visuospatial function, were explored. Children with NF1 displayed significant impairments in visuospatial learning, with reduced initial retention and poorer learning across repeated trials. Importantly, we demonstrated that visuospatial learning was inferior in NF1 even after accounting for group differences in intelligence, sustained attention and visuospatial abilities. We have thus identified impaired visuospatial learning as a core phenotypic feature in children with NF1. These findings imply that hippocampal-based learning networks are dysfunctional in children with NF1 and provide validation for a primary outcome measure for clinical trials aiming to correct aberrant Ras signaling."
22868655,Attentional WM is not necessarily specifically related with fluid intelligence: the case of smart children with ADHD symptoms,Cesare Cornoldi,"Executive functions and, in particular, Attentional (active) Working Memory (WM) have been associated with fluid intelligence. The association contrasts with the hypothesis that children with ADHD exhibit problems with WM tasks requiring controlled attention and may have a good fluid intelligence. This paper examines whether children who are intelligent but present ADHD symptoms fail in attentional WM tasks. The latter result would be problematic for theories assuming the generality of a strict relationship between intelligence and WM. To study these issues, a battery of tests was administered to a group of 58 children who all displayed symptoms of ADHD. All children were between the age of 8 and 11 years, and were described by their teachers as smart. Children were compared to a control group matched for age, schooling, and gender. The battery included a test of fluid intelligence (Raven's Coloured Matrices), and a series of visuospatial WM tasks. Results showed that children with ADHD were high in intelligence but significantly lower than the controls in WM tasks requiring high attentional control, whereas there was no difference in WM tasks requiring low attentional control. Furthermore, only high attentional control WM tasks were significantly related to Raven's performance in the control group, whereas all WM tasks were similarly related in the ADHD group. It is concluded that performance in high attentional control WM tasks may be related to fluid intelligence, but also to a specific control component that is independent of intelligence and is poor in children with ADHD."
22867869,Central TSC2 missense mutations are associated with a reduced risk of infantile spasms,Agnies M van Eeghen,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant syndrome with a variable neurocognitive phenotype. Recently, different intelligence profiles were observed for distinct mutation types and locations, suggesting that individuals with missense mutations represent a subgroup with milder neurocognitive outcomes. We applied these recent insights to the analysis of the epilepsy phenotype in a large cohort of patients with TSC. Associations between genotype and a history of epilepsy and/or infantile spasms (IS) were explored retrospectively, using data from 478 TSC patients from the databases of the Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance and the Herscot Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. Absolute and relative risks for IS and other types of epilepsy were calculated for various mutation classes, selected according to type and location. As expected, TSC2 mutations were associated with a significantly higher occurrence of IS and other epilepsy types. However, missense mutations located in the central region of TSC2 (exons 23-33) were associated with a significantly reduced incidence of IS. Our study further delineates the epilepsy phenotype in TSC patients. Identifying distinct epilepsy phenotypes for specific mutation subgroups may help identify relevant biomarkers and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions."
22866683,A route to well-being: intelligence versus wise reasoning,Igor Grossmann,"Laypeople and many social scientists assume that superior reasoning abilities lead to greater well-being. However, previous research has been inconclusive. This may be because prior investigators used operationalizations of reasoning that favored analytic as opposed to wise thinking. We assessed wisdom in terms of the degree to which people use various pragmatic schemas to deal with social conflicts. With a random sample of Americans, we found that wise reasoning is associated with greater life satisfaction, less negative affect, better social relationships, less depressive rumination, more positive versus negative words used in speech, and greater longevity. The relationship between wise reasoning and well-being held even when controlling for socioeconomic factors, verbal abilities, and several personality traits. As in prior work, there was no association between intelligence and well-being. Further, wise reasoning mediated age-related differences in well-being, particularly among middle-aged and older adults. Implications for research on reasoning, well-being, and aging are discussed."
22862890,Towards a clinical staging for bipolar disorder: defining patient subtypes based on functional outcome,María Reinares,"Background: The functional outcome of Bipolar Disorder (BD) is highly variable. This variability has been attributed to multiple demographic, clinical and cognitive factors. The critical next step is to identify combinations of predictors that can be used to specify prognostic subtypes, thus providing a basis for a staging classification in BD. Methods: Latent Class Analysis was applied to multiple predictors of functional outcome in a sample of 106 remitted adults with BD. Results: We identified two subtypes of patients presenting ""good"" (n=50; 47.6%) and ""poor"" (n=56; 52.4%) outcome. Episode density, level of residual depressive symptoms, estimated verbal intelligence and inhibitory control emerged as the most significant predictors of subtype membership at the p<0.05 level. Their odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) with reference to the ""good"" outcome group were: episode density (OR=4.622, CI 1.592-13.418), level of residual depressive symptoms (OR=1.543, CI 1.210-1.969), estimated verbal intelligence (OR=0.969; CI 0.945-0.995), and inhibitory control (OR=0.771, CI 0.656-0.907). Age, age of onset and duration of illness were comparable between prognostic groups. Limitations: The longitudinal stability or evolution of the subtypes was not tested. Conclusions: Our findings provide the first empirically derived staging classification of BD based on two underlying dimensions, one for illness severity and another for cognitive function. This approach can be further developed by expanding the dimensions included and testing the reproducibility and prospective prognostic value of the emerging classes. Developing a disease staging system for BD will allow individualised treatment planning for patients and selection of more homogeneous patient groups for research purposes."
22851225,Predicting adsorptive removal of chlorophenol from aqueous solution using artificial intelligence based modeling approaches,Kunwar P Singh,"The research aims to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based model to predict the adsorptive removal of 2-chlorophenol (CP) in aqueous solution by coconut shell carbon (CSC) using four operational variables (pH of solution, adsorbate concentration, temperature, and contact time), and to investigate their effects on the adsorption process. Accordingly, based on a factorial design, 640 batch experiments were conducted. Nonlinearities in experimental data were checked using Brock-Dechert-Scheimkman (BDS) statistics. Five nonlinear models were constructed to predict the adsorptive removal of CP in aqueous solution by CSC using four variables as input. Performances of the constructed models were evaluated and compared using statistical criteria. BDS statistics revealed strong nonlinearity in experimental data. Performance of all the models constructed here was satisfactory. Radial basis function network (RBFN) and multilayer perceptron network (MLPN) models performed better than generalized regression neural network, support vector machines, and gene expression programming models. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the contact time had highest effect on adsorption followed by the solution pH, temperature, and CP concentration. The study concluded that all the models constructed here were capable of capturing the nonlinearity in data. A better generalization and predictive performance of RBFN and MLPN models suggested that these can be used to predict the adsorption of CP in aqueous solution using CSC."
22851215,Cerebellar function in developmental dyslexia,Catherine J Stoodley,"Developmental dyslexia is a genetically based neurobiological syndrome, which is characterized by reading difficulty despite normal or high general intelligence. Even remediated dyslexic readers rarely achieve fast, fluent reading. Some dyslexics also have impairments in attention, short-term memory, sequencing (letters, word sounds, and motor acts), eye movements, poor balance, and general clumsiness. The presence of ""cerebellar"" motor and fluency symptoms led to the proposal that cerebellar dysfunction contributes to the etiology of dyslexia. Supporting this, functional imaging studies suggest that the cerebellum is part of the neural network supporting reading in typically developing readers, and reading difficulties have been reported in patients with cerebellar damage. Differences in both cerebellar asymmetry and gray matter volume are some of the most consistent structural brain findings in dyslexics compared with good readers. Furthermore, cerebellar functional activation patterns during reading and motor learning can differ in dyslexic readers. Behaviorally, some children and adults with dyslexia show poorer performance on cerebellar motor tasks, including eye movement control, postural stability, and implicit motor learning. However, many dyslexics do not have cerebellar signs, many cerebellar patients do not have reading problems, and differences in dyslexic brains are found throughout the whole reading network, and not isolated to the cerebellum. Therefore, impaired cerebellar function is probably not the primary cause of dyslexia, but rather a more fundamental neurodevelopmental abnormality leads to differences throughout the reading network."
22841936,Cognitive interventions in healthy older adults and people with mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review,Jennifer Reijnders,"Given that the research area of cognitive intervention studies in the aging population is growing rapidly, it is important to review and gauge more recent intervention studies, in order to determine the evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive interventions. The purpose of the present review was to update the recent systematic reviews of Papp et al. (2009) and Martin et al. (2011), to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive interventions in healthy older adults and people with MCI, by taking into account the methodological quality of the interventions studies. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCT) and clinical studies published between August 2007 and February 2012 in Pubmed and PsychINFO was performed. The quality of the included RCTs was assessed according to the CONSORT criteria for RCTs. A total of thirty-five studies were included; twenty-seven RTCs and eight clinical studies. The content of the intervention studies differed widely, as did the methodological quality of the included RCTs, but was considerably low with an average of 44% of the Consort items included. The results show evidence that cognitive training can be effective in improving various aspects of objective cognitive functioning; memory performance, executive functioning, processing speed, attention, fluid intelligence, and subjective cognitive performance. However, the issue whether the effects of cognitive interventions generalize to improvement in everyday life activities is still unresolved and needs to be addressed more explicitly in future research."
22836483,Predictors of a functional somatic syndrome diagnosis in patients with persistent functional somatic symptoms,Eva M Kingma,"Background: Functional somatic syndromes (FSS) are characterized by the existence of multiple persistent functional somatic symptoms. Not many patients fulfilling the criteria for an FSS, receive a formal diagnosis, and it is unknown which factors explain this discrepancy. Patients that tend to worry and patients that gather more health information may have an increased chance of an FSS diagnosis. We hypothesized that high intelligence and high neuroticism increase the probability of an FSS diagnosis in patients with persistent functional somatic symptoms. Purpose: This study aims to investigate patient factors that might be important in the process of syndrome labeling. Methods: Our study was performed in a large, representative population cohort (n = 976) in Groningen, The Netherlands, and included two assessment waves. Intelligence was measured using the General Aptitude Test Battery version B 1002-B. Neuroticism was measured using the 12-item neuroticism scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised. Functional somatic symptoms were measured with the somatization section of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Current FSS diagnosis was assessed with a questionnaire. We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses including sum scores of neuroticism, intelligence scores, sex, number of functional somatic symptoms, and age as potential predictors of having an FSS diagnosis. Results: From the 976 participants that completed measurements at follow-up, 289 (26.4 %) participants reported at least one persistent functional somatic symptom, and these subjects were included in the main analyses (38.4 % males, mean age of 55.2 years (SD = 10.7), 36-82 years). High numbers of functional somatic symptoms ((OR) = 1.320; 95 % (CI) = 1.097-1.588), female sex (OR = 9.068; 95 % CI = 4.061-20.251), and high intelligence (OR = 1.402; 95 % CI = 1.001-1.963) were associated with an FSS diagnosis, while age (OR = 0.989; 95 % CI = 960-1.019) and neuroticism (OR = 0.956; 95 % CI = 0.872-1.048) were not. Conclusion: This study suggests that high intelligence, but not high neuroticism, increases the chance of syndrome labeling in patients with persistent functional somatic symptoms."
22831704,"A prospective study of learning, memory, and executive function in new MDMA users",Daniel Wagner,"Aims: It is still unclear if cognitive abnormalities in human 3,4-methylenedioxymeth-amphetamine (MDMA) users existed before the beginning of use or if other confounders could explain the deficits. The present study was conducted in order to assess the relationship between beginning MDMA use and subsequent cognitive performance and to overcome previous methodological shortcomings. Design: A prospective cohort study in new MDMA users between 2006 and 2009 with a follow-up duration of 12 months. Setting and participants: Of the 149 almost MDMA-naive subjects examined at the initial assessment, 109 subjects participated again after 1 year. During this period, 43 subjects did not use any other illicit substance apart from cannabis; 23 subjects used more than 10 pills MDMA (mean = 33.6). These groups then were compared by means of multivariate analyses of variance. Measurements: Change scores between the initial examination and follow-up on a neuropsychological test battery including measures of learning, memory, and frontal executive functions [Auditiv-Verbaler Lerntest (AVLT), Lern- und Gedächtnistest (LGT) 3, digit span test, digit symbol test, Stroop task, Trail-making test]. In addition, a comprehensive number of possibly relevant confounders including age, general intelligence, cannabis use, alcohol use, cigarette use, medical treatment, participation in sports, nutrition, sleep patterns and subjective wellbeing was assessed. Findings: Groups did not differ in any of the potential confounders. However, significant effects of immediate and delayed recall of a visual paired associates learning task between MDMA users and controls were found (respectively, F ((1,64)) = 11.43, P = 0.001, η(2) = 0.136 and F ((1,64)) = 11.08, P = 0.002, η(2) = 0.144). No significant differences on the other neuropsychological tests were found. Conclusions: MDMA appears to impair visual paired associates learning in new users, suggesting serotonergic dysfunction in hippocampal regions as a consequence of MDMA use."
22824724,An automatic medication self-management and monitoring system for independently living patients,Corey McCall,"This paper describes the development, prototyping, and evaluation of RMAIS (RFID-based Medication Adherence Intelligence System). Previous work in this field has resulted in devices that are either costly or too complicated for general (especially elderly) patients to operate. RMAIS provides a practical and economical means for ordinary patients to easily manage their own medications, taking the right dosage of medicine at the prescribed time in a fully automatic way. The system design has the following features: (1) fully automatic operation for easy medication by using the built-in scale for dosage measurement and a motorized rotation plate to deliver the right medicine container in front of a patient, (2) various medication reminder messages for patients, and noncompliance alerts for caregivers (such as doctors, relatives or social workers who take care of the patients), and (3) incremental and economical adoption by pharmacies, patients, and insurance companies."
22820756,"Examining the impact of 45 minutes of daily physical education on cognitive ability, fitness performance, and body composition of African American youth",Julian A Reed,"Object: Increased importance on academic achievement has resulted in many school districts focusing on improved academic performance leading to reductions in physical education time. The purpose was to examine the effects of 45 minutes of daily physical education on the cognitive ability, fitness performance and body composition of African American elementary and middle school youth. Methods: Participants completing the informed consent in grades 2nd to 8th were included in the study. A pre/posttest design was used with repeated measures analysis of variance. Experimental and control school participants were pretested on the cognitive measures (ie, Fluid Intelligence and Perceptual Speed) and Fitnessgram® physical fitness test items (eg, aerobic capacity, muscular strength and muscular endurance, body composition) in September 2009 and posttested in May 2010. Results: Experimental elementary and middle school participants observed significantly greater improvements compared with control elementary and middle school participants on 7 of 16 fitness and body composition measures and on 8 of 26 cognitive measures. These fitness, body composition, and cognitive improvement differences were more noticeable among elementary and middle school females. Conclusions: Providing 45 minutes of daily physical education can perhaps increase cognitive ability while increasing fitness and decreasing the prevalence of overweight and obese youth."
22807280,Changes in resting-state functionally connected parietofrontal networks after videogame practice,Kenia Martínez,"Neuroimaging studies provide evidence for organized intrinsic activity under task-free conditions. This activity serves functionally relevant brain systems supporting cognition. Here, we analyze changes in resting-state functional connectivity after videogame practice applying a test-retest design. Twenty young females were selected from a group of 100 participants tested on four standardized cognitive ability tests. The practice and control groups were carefully matched on their ability scores. The practice group played during two sessions per week across 4 weeks (16 h total) under strict supervision in the laboratory, showing systematic performance improvements in the game. A group independent component analysis (GICA) applying multisession temporal concatenation on test-retest resting-state fMRI, jointly with a dual-regression approach, was computed. Supporting the main hypothesis, the key finding reveals an increased correlated activity during rest in certain predefined resting state networks (albeit using uncorrected statistics) attributable to practice with the cognitively demanding tasks of the videogame. Observed changes were mainly concentrated on parietofrontal networks involved in heterogeneous cognitive functions."
22806003,A systematic review on olfaction in child and adolescent psychiatric disorders,Martin Schecklmann,"There is substantial evidence that olfactory function may serve as biomarker in adult neuropsychiatric disorders, e.g. overall diminished olfaction in Parkinson's disease as parameter for early pre-motor and differential diagnosis. Here, we present data from a systematic literature review in olfactory function in child and adolescent psychiatric disorders and report two unpublished data sets of autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The overall number of olfaction studies is low-even after taking into account adult samples. In addition, heterogeneity of findings is high due to methodological limitations such as the use of different olfactory tests and odours targeting the olfactory and/or the trigeminal system and neglecting possible confounders, e.g., intelligence or oto-rhino-laryngological affections. Despite these limitations, there is some indication for specific alterations of olfactory function especially in disorders with dopaminergic pathology (e.g. attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, schizophrenia, 22q11 deletion syndrome). Dopamine is a relevant modulator of early processes in the olfactory bulb. Our systematic review provides the basis for future confirmatory studies investigating olfaction as putative biomarker in child and adolescent psychiatric disorders. We further propose studies of thorough and elaborate methodological standards in combination with imaging techniques and the investigation of the influence of genetic variation on olfactory function."
22806002,"Reliability and validity of autism diagnostic interview-revised, Japanese version",Kenji J Tsuchiya,"To examine the inter-rater reliability of Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, Japanese Version (ADI-R-JV), the authors recruited 51 individuals aged 3-19 years, interviewed by two independent raters. Subsequently, to assess the discriminant and diagnostic validity of ADI-R-JV, the authors investigated 317 individuals aged 2-19 years, who were divided into three diagnostic groups as follows: autistic disorder (AD), pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and other psychiatric diagnosis or no diagnosis, according to the consensus clinical diagnosis. As regards inter-rater reliability, intraclass correlation coefficients of greater than 0.80 were obtained for all three domains of ADI-R-JV. As regards discriminant validity, the mean scores of the three domains was significantly higher in individuals with AD than in those of other diagnostic groups. As regards diagnostic validity, sensitivity and specificity for correctly diagnosing AD were 0.92 and 0.89, respectively, but sensitivity was 0.55 for individuals younger than 5 years. Specificity was consistently high regardless of age and intelligence. ADI-R-JV was shown to be a reliable tool, and has sufficient discriminant validity and satisfactory diagnostic validity for correctly diagnosing AD, although the diagnostic validity appeared to be compromised with respect to the diagnosis of younger individuals."
22798397,A selective role for right insula--basal ganglia circuits in appetitive stimulus processing,Lavanya Vijayaraghavan,"Hemispheric lateralization of hedonic evaluation ('liking') and incentive motivation ('wanting') in neural networks connecting the basal ganglia and insula (BG-I) in humans was examined. Participants with brain damage restricted to the BG-I of the right (n = 5) or left (n = 5) hemisphere, and 26 healthy participants matched on age, sex and intelligence quotient were tested on positively and negatively valenced pictures drawn from varied stimulus categories (Vijayaraghavan et al., 2008). Liking was assessed with explicit ratings of pleasantness using a nine-point Likert scale. Wanting was quantified as the amount of work (via repeated keypresses) that participants expended to increase (approach) or decrease (withdraw) viewing time. Right-lesion patients showed abnormally low viewing times and liking ratings for positive images. For a subset of positive images depicting sexual content, right-lesion patients exhibited active withdrawal, while the other two groups approached such stimuli. These results suggest that the right basal ganglia-insula complex plays a greater role than the left in supporting hedonic evaluation and motivational approach to positively valenced stimuli. The finding that active avoidance of stimuli that were not 'liked' was spared in both right- and left-sided lesion subjects suggests that unilateral damage to insula/basal ganglia circuits may not be sufficient to affect general incentive motivation independent of preference."
22789779,Dorsolateral prefrontal contributions to human working memory,Aron K Barbey,"Although neuroscience has made remarkable progress in understanding the involvement of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in human memory, the necessity of dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) for key competencies of working memory remains largely unexplored. We therefore studied human brain lesion patients to determine whether dlPFC is necessary for working memory function, administering subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and the N-Back Task to three participant groups: dlPFC lesions (n=19), non-dlPFC lesions (n=152), and no brain lesions (n=54). DlPFC damage was associated with deficits in the manipulation of verbal and spatial knowledge, with left dlPFC necessary for manipulating information in working memory and right dlPFC critical for manipulating information in a broader range of reasoning contexts. Our findings elucidate the architecture of working memory, providing key neuropsychological evidence for the necessity of dlPFC in the manipulation of verbal and spatial knowledge."
22770543,Fasting plasma insulin and the default mode network in women at risk for Alzheimer's disease,Heather Kenna,"Brain imaging studies in Alzheimer's disease research have demonstrated structural and functional perturbations in the hippocampus and default mode network (DMN). Additional evidence suggests risk for pathological brain aging in association with insulin resistance (IR). This study piloted investigation of associations of IR with DMN-hippocampal functional connectivity among postmenopausal women at risk for Alzheimer's disease. Twenty middle-aged women underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects were dichotomized relative to fasting plasma insulin levels (i.e., > 8 μIU/mL [n = 10] and < 8 μIU/mL [n = 10]), and functional connectivity analysis contrasted their respective blood oxygen level-dependent signal correlation between DMN and hippocampal regions. Higher-insulin women had significantly reduced positive associations between the medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral parahippocampal regions extending to the right hippocampus, and conversely, between the left and right hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. Neuropsychological data (all within normal ranges) also showed significant differences with respect to executive functioning and global intelligence. The results provide further evidence of deleterious effects of IR on the hippocampus and cognition. Further imaging studies of the IR-related perturbations in DMN-hippocampal functional connectivity are needed."
22761402,Functional magnetic resonance imaging reveals changes in language localization in children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes,Jennifer Vannest,"In children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, centrotemporal spikes may cause language dysfunction via disruption of underlying functional neuroanatomy. Fifteen patients with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes and 15 healthy controls completed 3 functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) language paradigms; standardized cognitive and language assessments were also performed. For all paradigms, children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes showed specific regional differences in activation compared to controls. Children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes also differed from controls on neuropsychological testing. They did not differ in general intelligence, but children with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes scored significantly lower than controls on tests of language, visuomotor integration, and processing speed. These results extend previous findings of lower language and cognitive skills in patients with benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, and suggest epilepsy-related remodeling of language networks that may underlie these observed differences."
22752489,"Effectiveness and safety of donepezil in boys with fragile x syndrome: a double-blind, randomized, controlled pilot study",Jitendra Kumar Sahu,"The present study was designed as a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of donepezil in boys with fragile X syndrome. Twenty boys with fragile X syndrome were randomized to receive 12 weeks of treatment with either placebo or donepezil (2.5 mg daily for initial 4 weeks followed by 5 mg daily for next 8 weeks). The outcome measures included change in intelligence quotient scores on Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (Hindi adaptation by Kulshrestha), change in behavioral scores by Conners 3 Parent Rating Scale (Short) and Childhood Autism Rating Scale, safety, and tolerability of donepezil. The study failed to show significant difference in intelligence quotient and behavioral scales with donepezil therapy over 12 weeks. However, donepezil appeared to be safe and well tolerated."
22752481,Congenital brain damage: cognitive development correlates with lesion and electroencephalographic features,Daria Riva,"The purpose of this study was to assess cognitive development in 26 children with congenital focal brain lesion and unilateral spastic cerebral palsy first diagnosed and followed up for rehabilitation at our institution. Mean intelligence quotients (IQs) were correlated not only to the different features of the cerebral lesions, but also to the different types of electroencephalographic abnormalities. We also examined individual scores. We found that about 70% of the children had values of Full-Scale, Verbal, and Performance IQs within the normal range. No differences were found between left and right injured children. Different Verbal IQ-Performance IQ profiles were observed. Larger lesions and some electroencephalographic features, mainly signal slowing/attenuation as signs of structural brain damage, were significantly associated with lower intellectual abilities. The role of other factors, including genetic and environmental background variability, as well as rehabilitative treatments, on cognitive sequelae in such patients was discussed."
22746270,"Food, class, and health: the role of the perceived body in the social reproduction of health",Shawna L Carroll Chapman,"The association between social class and cardiovascular health is complex, involving a constant interplay of factors as individuals integrate external information from the media, health care providers, and people they know with personal experience to produce health behaviors. This ethnographic study took place from February 2008 to February 2009 to assess how cardiovascular health information circulating in Kansas City influenced a sample of 55 women in the area. Participants were primarily Caucasian (n = 41) but diverse in terms of age, income, and education. Themes identified in transcripts showed women shared the same idea of an ideal body, young and thin, and associated this perception with ideas about good health, intelligence, and morality. Transcript themes corresponded to those found at health events and in the media that emphasized individual control over determinants of disease. Women's physical appearance and health behaviors corresponded to class indicators. Four categories were identified to represent women's shared beliefs and practices in relation to class, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Findings were placed within an existing body of social theory to better understand how cardiovascular health information and women's associated beliefs relate to health inequality."
22743090,A noradrenergic theory of cognitive reserve: implications for Alzheimer's disease,Ian H Robertson,"The gap between symptoms and pathology in Alzheimer's disease has been explained by the hypothetical construct of ""cognitive reserve""--a set of variables including education, intelligence, and mental stimulation which putatively allow the brain to adapt to-and hence mask--underlying pathologies by maintaining cognitive function despite underlying neural changes. This review proposes a hypothesis that a biological mechanism may mediate between these social/psychological processes on the one hand, and apparently reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease on the other, namely repeated activation of the noradrenergic system over a lifetime by the processes implicated in cognitive reserve. Noradrenaline's neuroprotective effects both in vivo and in vitro, and its key role in mediating the neuroprotective effects of environmental enrichment on the brain, make noradrenaline's key role in mediating cognitive reserve--by disease compensation, disease modification, or a combination of both--a viable hypothesis."
22733126,Genome-wide supported variant MIR137 and severe negative symptoms predict membership of an impaired cognitive subtype of schizophrenia,M J Green,"Progress in determining the aetiology of schizophrenia (Sz) has arguably been limited by a poorly defined phenotype. We sought to delineate empirically derived cognitive subtypes of Sz to investigate the association of a genetic variant identified in a recent genome-wide association study with specific phenotypic characteristics of Sz. We applied Grade of Membership (GoM) analyses to 617 patients meeting ICD-10 criteria for Sz (n=526) or schizoaffective disorder (n=91), using cognitive performance indicators collected within the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank. Cognitive variables included subscales from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, the Controlled Oral Word Association Test and the Letter Number Sequencing Test, and standardised estimates of premorbid and current intelligence quotient. The most parsimonious GoM solution yielded two subtypes of clinical cases reflecting those with cognitive deficits (CDs; N=294), comprising 47.6% of the sample who were impaired across all cognitive measures, and a cognitively spared group (CS; N=323) made up of the remaining 52.4% who performed relatively well on all cognitive tests. The CD subgroup were more likely to be unemployed, had an earlier illness onset, and greater severity of functional disability and negative symptoms than the CS group. Risk alleles on the MIR137 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) predicted membership of CD subtype only in combination with higher severity of negative symptoms. These findings provide the first evidence for association of the MIR137 SNP with a specific Sz phenotype characterised by severe CDs and negative symptoms, consistent with the emerging role of microRNAs in the regulation of proteins responsible for neural development and function."
22730925,Cognitive aging explains age-related differences in face-based recognition of basic emotions except for anger and disgust,Atsunobu Suzuki,"This study aimed at a detailed understanding of the possible dissociable influences of cognitive aging on the recognition of facial expressions of basic emotions (happiness, surprise, fear, anger, disgust, and sadness). The participants were 36 older and 36 young adults. They viewed 96 pictures of facial expressions and were asked to choose one emotion that best described each. Four cognitive tasks measuring the speed of processing and fluid intelligence were also administered, the scores of which were used to compute a composite measure of general cognitive ability. A series of hierarchical regression analyses revealed that age-related deficits in identifying happiness, surprise, fear, and sadness were statistically explained by general cognitive ability, while the differences in anger and disgust were not. This provides clear evidence that age-related cognitive impairment remarkably and differentially affects the recognition of basic emotions, contrary to the common view that cognitive aging has a uniformly minor effect."
22725688,"Science of the science, drug discovery and artificial neural networks",Jigneshkumar Patel,"Drug discovery process many times encounters complex problems, which may be difficult to solve by human intelligence. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are one of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies used for solving such complex problems. ANNs are widely used for primary virtual screening of compounds, quantitative structure activity relationship studies, receptor modeling, formulation development, pharmacokinetics and in all other processes involving complex mathematical modeling. Despite having such advanced technologies and enough understanding of biological systems, drug discovery is still a lengthy, expensive, difficult and inefficient process with low rate of new successful therapeutic discovery. In this paper, author has discussed the drug discovery science and ANN from very basic angle, which may be helpful to understand the application of ANN for drug discovery to improve efficiency."
22716898,Pre- and postnatal drivers of childhood intelligence: evidence from Singapore,Gail Pacheco,"This study seeks to investigate what influences intelligence in early childhood. The Singapore Cohort Study of the Risk Factors of Myopia (SCORM) is used to assess determinants of childhood IQ and changes in IQ. This longitudinal data set, collected in 1999, includes a wealth of demographic, socioeconomic and prenatal characteristics. The richness of the data allows various econometric approaches to be employed, including the use of ordered and multinomial logit analysis. Mother's education is found to be a consistent and key determinant of childhood IQ. Father's education and school quality are found to be key drivers for increasing IQ levels above the average sample movement."
22708717,"No evidence of intelligence improvement after working memory training: a randomized, placebo-controlled study",Thomas S Redick,"Numerous recent studies seem to provide evidence for the general intellectual benefits of working memory training. In reviews of the training literature, Shipstead, Redick, and Engle (2010, 2012) argued that the field should treat recent results with a critical eye. Many published working memory training studies suffer from design limitations (no-contact control groups, single measures of cognitive constructs), mixed results (transfer of training gains to some tasks but not others, inconsistent transfer to the same tasks across studies), and lack of theoretical grounding (identifying the mechanisms responsible for observed transfer). The current study compared young adults who received 20 sessions of practice on an adaptive dual n-back program (working memory training group) or an adaptive visual search program (active placebo-control group) with a no-contact control group that received no practice. In addition, all subjects completed pretest, midtest, and posttest sessions comprising multiple measures of fluid intelligence, multitasking, working memory capacity, crystallized intelligence, and perceptual speed. Despite improvements on both the dual n-back and visual search tasks with practice, and despite a high level of statistical power, there was no positive transfer to any of the cognitive ability tests. We discuss these results in the context of previous working memory training research and address issues for future working memory training studies."
22703607,Aripiprazole improves various cognitive and behavioral impairments after traumatic brain injury: a case report,Wakako Umene-Nakano,"Various types of cognitive and behavioral impairments occur after traumatic brain injury. We present a case exhibiting psychotic symptoms such as irritability, dysphoria, anxiety and insomnia with severe brain dysfunction due to a right temporal lobe contusion incurred in a traffic accident. The patient did not sufficiently respond to rehabilitation or treatment with any pharmacotherapy. In the present case, aripiprazole dramatically improved the patient's symptoms and cognitive function. We evaluated the case using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised and the Wechsler Memory Scale Revised between baseline and 5 years later."
22696400,Childhood maltreatment is associated with an automatic negative emotion processing bias in the amygdala,Udo Dannlowski,"Major depression has been repeatedly associated with amygdala hyper-responsiveness to negative (but not positive) facial expressions at early, automatic stages of emotion processing using subliminally presented stimuli. However, it is not clear whether this ""limbic bias"" is a correlate of depression or represents a vulnerability marker preceding the onset of the disease. Because childhood maltreatment is a potent risk factor for the development of major depression in later life, we explored whether childhood maltreatment is associated with amygdalar emotion processing bias in maltreated but healthy subjects. Amygdala responsiveness to subliminally presented sad and happy faces was measured by means of fMRI at 3 T in N = 150 healthy subjects carefully screened for psychiatric disorders. Childhood maltreatment was assessed by the 25-item childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ). A strong association of CTQ-scores with amygdala responsiveness to sad, but not happy facial expressions emerged. This result was further qualified by an interaction of emotional valence and CTQ-scores and was not confounded by trait anxiety, current depression level, age, gender, intelligence, education level, and more recent stressful life-events. Childhood maltreatment is apparently associated with detectable changes in amygdala function during early stages of emotion processing which resemble findings described in major depression. Limbic hyper-responsiveness to negative facial cues could be a consequence of the experience of maltreatment during childhood increasing the risk of depression in later life. Limitation: the present association of limbic bias and maltreatment was demonstrated in the absence of psychopathological abnormalities, thereby limiting strong conclusions."
22686638,The modular nature of trustworthiness detection,Jean-François Bonnefon,"The capacity to trust wisely is a critical facilitator of success and prosperity, and it has been conjectured that people of higher intelligence are better able to detect signs of untrustworthiness from potential partners. In contrast, this article reports five trust game studies suggesting that reading trustworthiness of the faces of strangers is a modular process. Trustworthiness detection from faces is independent of general intelligence (Study 1) and effortless (Study 2). Pictures that include nonfacial features such as hair and clothing impair trustworthiness detection (Study 3) by increasing reliance on conscious judgments (Study 4), but people largely prefer to make decisions from this sort of pictures (Study 5). In sum, trustworthiness detection in an economic interaction is a genuine and effortless ability, possessed in equal amount by people of all cognitive capacities, but whose impenetrability leads to inaccurate conscious judgments and inappropriate informational preferences."
22686370,Cognitive and behavioral attention in children with math difficulties,Alanna B Gold,"Cognitive assessments and behavioral ratings of attention were used to examine the relation of inattention to math performance in children. Third grade students with math difficulties (MD; n = 17) and math and reading difficulties (MDRD; n = 35) were administered the Attentional Network Test (ANT), as well as achievement and intelligence measures. Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD-Symptoms and Normal-Behavior-IV (SWAN-IV) Inattention ratings were collected from teachers. Two comparison groups were also recruited: a typically achieving group (n = 23) and a group that responded to a math-tutoring intervention (responders; n = 54). On the ANT, children with MD and MDRD did not perform significantly different than typically achieving children or responders on measures of alerting and orienting attention and executive control. All subgroups did demonstrate performance patterns that were expected on the ANT. However, performance across blocks of the task was inconsistent, suggesting poor reliability. There were no relations between ANT performance and SWAN-IV behavioral inattention scores, though behavioral ratings of inattention correlated significantly with math performance. Children with MD and MDRD may have more difficulty with distraction and attention to detail in contextual situations, as opposed to impulsive responding in these settings. The lack of relation between cognitive attention and math performance may suggest that either the ANT does not assess the relevant attention constructs associated with math difficulties or may parallel studies of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in which cognitive and behavioral assessments are weakly related."
22672655,Comparing alcohol affordability in 65 cities worldwide,Ming-Yue Kan,"Introduction and aims: To develop a measure of alcohol affordability (AA) and compare the AA of 65 cities worldwide. Design and methods: In this paper, AA is defined as the proportion of median daily income needed to buy a certain quantity of certain alcoholic beverages. The income data and the price of alcoholic beverages were drawn from the Union Bank of Switzerland survey and the Economist Intelligence Unit respectively. Results: A large majority of cities (87.7%, n = 57) had a high level of AA. The top 20 ranking was occupied by European and American cities with Tokyo in the Western Pacific region being the exception. All cities belonging to high-income countries had high levels of AA. However, two cities with low-level AA came from low-middle-income countries instead of low-income countries. Discussion and conclusions: The findings have shown that alcohol consumption is highly affordable in many cities. If price policy is being considered as policy instrument of alcohol control, it is in urgent need of price adjustments. More specifically, the new emerging economies play a significant role in the world alcohol control movement because of their bright economic performance with huge population size. Further studies on AA, especially periodical monitoring and its impacts on alcohol consumption and alcohol related health problems, should be conducted so as to facilitate the formulation and evaluation price measure of alcohol control."
22672571,Survival outcome of patients with screening versus symptomatically detected colorectal cancers,R Pande,"Aim: The national Bowel Cancer Screening Programme has been rolled out nationwide following pilot screening in two health authorities in the UK. The aim of this study was to define overall 5-year survival of screen detected cancers and to compare the overall survival outcome of screened vs symptomatic patients over a 10-year period. Method: All patients with colorectal cancer treated at one trust in patients of screening age (50-69 years) during the pilot screening programme (2000-2008) were analysed. Patients were defined as screen detected or symptomatically detected. Disease pathology and recurrence data were obtained from the hospital's computerized results reporting system and mortality was cross-matched with data from the West Midlands Cancer Intelligence Network. Results: In all, 633 patients aged 50-69 were identified in the study period; 155 patients had a screen detected cancer and 478 did not. A log-rank test completed on survival outcomes indicated that survival was significantly worse in the symptomatic group. This difference persisted if only patients treated with curative intent were considered. Conclusion: Survival outcome was significantly better in the screened vs the symptomatic population in all groups and also in those treated for curative intent. There was a trend towards better survival for screen detected cancer when compared stage for stage."
22665261,Cortical thickness of superior frontal cortex predicts impulsiveness and perceptual reasoning in adolescence,C Schilling,"Impulsiveness is a pivotal personality trait representing a core domain in all major personality inventories. Recently, impulsiveness has been identified as an important modulator of cognitive processing, particularly in tasks that require the processing of large amounts of information. Although brain imaging studies have implicated the prefrontal cortex to be a common underlying representation of impulsiveness and related cognitive functioning, to date a fine-grain and detailed morphometric analysis has not been carried out. On the basis of ahigh-resolution magnetic resonance scans acquired in 1620 healthy adolescents (IMAGEN), the individual cortical thickness (CT) was estimated. Correlations between Cloninger's impulsiveness and CT were studied in an entire cortex analysis. The cluster identified was tested for associations with performance in perceptual reasoning tasks of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC IV). We observed a significant inverse correlation between trait impulsiveness and CT of the left superior frontal cortex (SFC; Monte Carlo Simulation P<0.01). CT within this cluster correlated with perceptual reasoning scores (Bonferroni corrected) of the WISC IV. On the basis of a large sample of adolescents, we identified an extended area in the SFC as a correlate of impulsiveness, which appears to be in line with the trait character of this prominent personality facet. The association of SFC thickness with perceptual reasoning argues for a common neurobiological basis of personality and specific cognitive domains comprising attention, spatial reasoning and response selection. The results may facilitate the understanding of the role of impulsiveness in several psychiatric disorders associated with prefrontal dysfunctions and cognitive deficits."
22661411,The influence of prior expectations on emotional face perception in adolescence,Guillaume Barbalat,"Prior expectations influence the way incoming stimuli are processed. A standard, validated way of manipulating prior expectations is to bias participants to perceive a stimulus by instructing them to look out for this type of stimulus. Here, we investigated the influence of prior expectations on the processing of incoming stimuli (emotional faces) in adolescence. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we assessed activity and functional connectivity in 13 adolescents and 13 healthy adults (matched for gender and intelligence quotient), while they were presented with sequences of emotional faces (happy, fearful, or angry). A specific instruction at the start of each sequence instructed the participants to look out for fearful or angry faces in the subsequent sequence. Both groups responded more accurately and with shorter reaction times (RTs) to faces that were congruent with the instruction. For anger, this bias was lower in the adolescents (for RTs), and adults demonstrated greater activation than adolescents in the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) and greater functional connectivity between the vMPFC and the thalamus when the face was congruent with the instruction. Our results demonstrate that the influence of prior expectations (in the form of an instruction) on the subsequent processing of face stimuli is still developing in the adolescent brain."
22641565,Association of sleep disturbances with cognitive impairment and depression in maintenance hemodialysis patients,Luke Rodriguez,"Background: There are few data on the relationship of sleep with measures of cognitive function and symptoms of depression in dialysis patients. Methods: We evaluated the relationship of sleep with cognitive function and symptoms of depression in 168 hemodialysis patients, using multivariable linear and logistic regression. Sleep disturbances were assessed using the sleep subscale battery of the Choices for Healthy Outcomes in Caring for ESRD (CHOICE) Health Experience Questionnaire. The cognitive battery assessed a broad range of functioning including global ability, verbal intelligence, supraspan learning, auditory retention, visual retention, attention/mental processing speed, visual construction/fluid reasoning and motor speed. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression (CESD) Scale, with depression indicated by a CESD score >16. Results: Mean (SD) age of participants was 62 (17) years, 49% were women, 30% were African American and 33% had diabetes. There was no significant relationship between sleep score and performance on any neurocognitive test (p>0.13, for all multivariable analyses). The prevalence of depression increased from 16% in the highest quartile (best) of sleep score, to 31% in the lowest quartile (worst) of sleep score. In multivariable analyses, each 1 SD increase in sleep score was associated with a 2.18 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-3.29, p<0.001) lower CESD score. Results were consistent when considering individual components of both the CESD and sleep score. Conclusions: Disturbances in sleep are associated with symptoms of depression but not measures of cognitive function. Dialysis patients with disturbances in sleep should be screened for depression."
22634247,Dorsolateral prefrontal contributions to human intelligence,Aron K Barbey,"Although cognitive neuroscience has made remarkable progress in understanding the involvement of the prefrontal cortex in executive control functions for human intelligence, the necessity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) for key competencies of general intelligence and executive function remains to be well established. Here we studied human brain lesion patients with dlPFC lesions to investigate whether this region is computationally necessary for performance on neuropsychological tests of general intelligence and executive function, administering the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and subtests of the Delis Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) to three groups: dlPFC lesions (n=19), non-dlPFC lesions (n=152), and no brain lesions (n=55). The results indicate that: (1) patients with focal dlPFC damage exhibit lower scores, at the latent variable level, than controls in general intelligence (g) and executive function; (2) dlPFC patients demonstrate lower scores than controls in several executive measures; and (3) these latter differences are no longer significant when the pervasive influence of the general factor of intelligence (g) is statistically removed. The observed findings support a central role for the dlPFC in global aspects of general intelligence and make specific recommendations for the interpretation and application of the WAIS and D-KEFS to the study of high-level cognition in health and disease."
22617391,Cognitive ability in early adulthood is associated with later suicide and suicide attempt: the role of risk factors over the life course,A Sörberg,"Background: Cognitive ability/intelligence quotient (IQ) in youth has previously been associated with subsequent completed and attempted suicide, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying the associations. This study aims to assess the roles of various risk factors over the life course in explaining the observed relationships. Method: The present investigation is a cohort study based on data on IQ test performance and covariates, recorded on 49 321 Swedish men conscripted in 1969-1970, at ages 18-20 years. Information on suicides and hospital admissions for suicide attempt up to the age of 57 years, childhood and adult socio-economic position, and adult family formation, was obtained from linkage to national registers. Results: Lower IQ was associated with increased risks of both suicide and suicide attempt during the 36 years of follow-up. The associations followed a dose-response pattern. They were attenuated by approximately 45% in models controlling for social background, mental ill-health, aspects of personality and behavior, adult socio-economic position and family formation. Based on one-unit decreases in IQ test performance on a nine-point scale, the hazard ratios between ages 35 and 57 years were: for suicide 1.19 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.25], fully adjusted 1.10 (95% CI 1.04-1.18); and for suicide attempt 1.25 (95% CI 1.20-1.31), fully adjusted 1.14 (95% CI 1.09-1.20). Conclusions: Cognitive ability was found to be associated with subsequent completed and attempted suicide. The associations were attenuated by 45% after controlling for risk factors measured over the life course. Psychiatric diagnosis, maladjustment and aspects of personality in young adulthood, and social circumstances in later adulthood, contributed in attenuating the associations."
22612165,Interference within the focus of attention: working memory tasks reflect more than temporary maintenance,Zach Shipstead,"One approach to understanding working memory (WM) holds that individual differences in WM capacity arise from the amount of information a person can store in WM over short periods of time. This view is especially prevalent in WM research conducted with the visual arrays task. Within this tradition, many researchers have concluded that the average person can maintain approximately 4 items in WM. The present study challenges this interpretation by demonstrating that performance on the visual arrays task is subject to time-related factors that are associated with retrieval from long-term memory. Experiment 1 demonstrates that memory for an array does not decay as a product of absolute time, which is consistent with both maintenance- and retrieval-based explanations of visual arrays performance. Experiment 2 introduced a manipulation of temporal discriminability by varying the relative spacing of trials in time. We found that memory for a target array was significantly influenced by its temporal compression with, or isolation from, a preceding trial. Subsequent experiments extend these effects to sub-capacity set sizes and demonstrate that changes in the size of k are meaningful to prediction of performance on other measures of WM capacity as well as general fluid intelligence. We conclude that performance on the visual arrays task does not reflect a multi-item storage system but instead measures a person's ability to accurately retrieve information in the face of proactive interference."
22610954,Wilson's disease: update on integrated Chinese and Western medicine,Wen-Jie Li,"Wilson's disease (WD), or hepatolenticular degeneration, is an autosomal recessive inheritance disorder of copper metabolism caused by ATP7B gene mutation. As WD is an inherited disease of the nervous system that is not curable; early diagnosis with early and life-long treatment leads to better prognoses. Currently, the recommended treatment for WD is integrated Chinese and Western medicine. A number of studies indicate that treatment of integrative medicine can not only enforce the de-copper effect but also improve liver function, intelligence, and other factors. This article reviewed in detail the advantages of WD treated with Chinese and Western medicine together."
22595503,"CAD: how it works, how to use it, performance",Daniele Regge,"Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are software algorithms designed to assist radiologists (or other practitioners) in solving a diagnostic problem by using a visual prompt (or ""CAD mark"") to direct the observer towards potential pathology. CT colonography is a recent arrival to CAD, but could represent one of its most fruitful applications in the future. In contrast to other organs, where a variety of different pathologies are equally represented, significant colorectal pathologies other than polyps and cancer are relatively uncommon. As we shall see, this simplifies the diagnostic task for artificial intelligence developers and also for radiologists who, ultimately, must make the final decision. This review aims to present the current state-of-the-art for CAD applied to CT colonography. A brief overview of the technical essentials and of the diagnostic performance of CAD in isolation, is followed by an explanation of how CAD is used in day-to-day practice. The last section will deal with the most controversial issues affecting CAD performance in clinical practice, with a focus on the interaction between human and artificial intelligence."
22581197,Professional and pathological gamblers: similarities and differences,Jeremiah Weinstock,"Although much recent research has focused on the gambling practices and psychosocial functioning of pathological gamblers, few investigations have examined the characteristics of professional gamblers. The current project sought to address this gap in the literature by conducting a quantitative comparison of professional and pathological gamblers. Pathological gamblers were recruited and balanced with professional gamblers on demographic variables and preferred gambling activity. A total of 22 professional gamblers and 13 pathological gamblers completed an extensive self-report battery including instruments assessing demographics, gambling behaviors and problems, other psychiatric disorders, current psychosocial functioning, recent stressful events, personality characteristics, and intelligence. Pathological and professional gamblers reported similar rates of gambling frequency and intensity and types of games played. Pathological gamblers endorsed poor psychosocial functioning, whereas professional gamblers reported a rate of psychiatric distress within a normative range. Pathological gamblers also reported lower gambling self-efficacy, greater impulsivity, and more past-year DSM-IV Axis I disorders than professional gamblers. The results of the present study shed light on the unique circumstances of professional gamblers, as well as underscore important differences between such individuals and pathological gamblers that could prove fruitful in future research and intervention and prevention efforts."
22581173,Correlation between corpus callosum shape and cognitive performance in healthy young adults,Manuel Martín-Loeches,"Corpus callosum (CC) might be related to cognitive performance because of its role in interhemispheric communication. Previous research has focused mainly on volumetric analyses of the CC, yielding contradictory results to some extent. Shape is an approach that integrates and extends the data obtained with the volumetric methodology. Here, we analyze the relationships between midsagittal CC shape variation and several cognitive measures. 2D coordinates from 102 MRI-scanned young adult human CCs were superimposed through a Procrustes approach. The residual variation was regressed onto 21 cognitive measures completed by the participants. Most of these measures (including general intelligence, working memory, executive functioning, and mental speed) were unrelated to midsagittal CC morphology. However, attentional control did show consistent and significant correlations with CC shape variation. Slower responses in attentional control were systematically associated with more curved and thinner CC, with consequent rotation of the splenium and the genu. Although the magnitude of the correlations suggests a small relationship of midsagittal CC geometry and attention, the results provide interesting clues regarding the links between brain anatomical configuration and human cognitive function."
22575089,Neuropsychological performance and family history in children at age 7 who develop adult schizophrenia or bipolar psychosis in the New England Family Studies,L J Seidman,"Background: Persons developing schizophrenia (SCZ) manifest various pre-morbid neuropsychological deficits, studied most often by measures of IQ. Far less is known about pre-morbid neuropsychological functioning in individuals who later develop bipolar psychoses (BP). We evaluated the specificity and impact of family history (FH) of psychosis on pre-morbid neuropsychological functioning. Method: We conducted a nested case-control study investigating the associations of neuropsychological data collected systematically at age 7 years for 99 adults with psychotic diagnoses (including 45 SCZ and 35 BP) and 101 controls, drawn from the New England cohort of the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP). A mixed-model approach evaluated full-scale IQ, four neuropsychological factors derived from principal components analysis (PCA), and the profile of 10 intelligence and achievement tests, controlling for maternal education, race and intra-familial correlation. We used a deviant responder approach (<10th percentile) to calculate rates of impairment. Results: There was a significant linear trend, with the SCZ group performing worst. The profile of childhood deficits for persons with SCZ did not differ significantly from BP. Neuropsychological impairment was identified in 42.2% of SCZ, 22.9% of BP and 7% of controls. The presence of psychosis in first-degree relatives (FH+) significantly increased the severity of childhood impairment for SCZ but not for BP. Conclusions: Pre-morbid neuropsychological deficits are found in a substantial proportion of children who later develop SCZ, especially in the SCZ FH+ subgroup, but less so in BP, suggesting especially impaired neurodevelopment underlying cognition in pre-SCZ children. Future work should assess genetic and environmental factors that explain this FH effect."
22555367,The role of timing in testing nonverbal IQ in children with ASD,Margaret McGonigle-Chalmers,"15 School-aged high functioning children on the autistic spectrum were compared with a neurotypical cohort on the WISC-III and the KABC-II, to determine the impact of the relatively more strict timing criteria of the former test on the evaluation of nonverbal intelligence. Significant group effects, showing lower performance by the ASD group were found for three of the five sub-tests for the WISC but not for the KABC, peaks and troughs were more evident for the WISC, and the evaluation of intellectual level was also markedly lower for ASD children on the WISC-III as opposed to the KABC-II. The results are discussed in terms of how speed of processing can impact on how children with ASD are 'matched' against neurotypical samples."
22541368,Influence of maternal and paternal IQ on offspring health and health behaviours: evidence for some trans-generational associations using the 1958 British birth cohort study,E Whitley,"Purpose: Individuals scoring poorly on tests of intelligence (IQ) have been reported as having increased risk of morbidity, premature mortality, and risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, poor diet, alcohol and cigarette consumption. Very little is known about the impact of parental IQ on the health and health behaviours of their offspring. Methods: We explored associations of maternal and paternal IQ scores with offspring television viewing, injuries, hospitalisations, long standing illness, height and BMI at ages 4 to 18 using data from the National Child Development Study (1958 birth cohort). Results: Data were available for 1446 mother-offspring and 822 father-offspring pairs. After adjusting for potential confounding/mediating factors, the children of higher IQ parents were less likely to watch TV (odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for watching 3+ vs. less than 3hours per week associated with a standard deviation increase in maternal or paternal IQ: 0.75 (0.64, 0.88) or 0.78 (0.64, 0.95) respectively) and less likely to have one or more injuries requiring hospitalisation (0.77 (0.66, 0.90) or 0.72 (0.56, 0.91) respectively for maternal or paternal IQ). Conclusions: Children whose parents have low IQ scores may have poorer selected health and health behaviours. Health education might usefully be targeted at these families."
22534679,Nonorganic (functional) hearing loss in children],C-M Schmidt,"Nonorganic (functional) hearing loss in children is characterized by hearing loss without a detectable corresponding pathology in the auditory system. It is not an uncommon disease in childhood. Typically, there is a discrepancy between elevated pure tone thresholds and normal speech discrimination in everyday life. We evaluated 85 original publications, 27 reviews and 4 textbook articles. Mean age at diagnosis was 11.3 years. Girls were affected twice as often as boys. Patient histories showed a high prevalence of emotional and school problems. Pre-existing organic hearing loss can be worsened by nonorganic causes. A brainstem audiometry should confirm the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes auditory processing disorder, elevated thresholds in mental retardation and auditory neuropathy. We recommend taking a personal history including biographical factors, a psychological assessment including intelligence testing and referral to a child psychiatrist. Prognosis seems to be dependent on the severity of the patient's school and/or personal problems. Categorization following the Austen-Lynch model can be a valuable prognostic factor."
22531092,Just as smart but not as successful: obese students obtain lower school grades but equivalent test scores to nonobese students,C MacCann,"Objective: The obesity epidemic in industrialized nations has important implications for education, as research demonstrates lower academic achievement among obese students. The current paper compares the test scores and school grades of obese, overweight and normal-weight students in secondary and further education, controlling for demographic variables, personality, ability and well-being confounds. Participants: This study included 383 eighth-grade students (49% female; study 1) and 1036 students from 24 community colleges and universities (64% female, study 2), both drawn from five regions across the United States. Measures: In study 1, body mass index (BMI) was calculated using self-reports and parent reports of weight and height. In study 2, BMI was calculated from self-reported weight and height only. Both samples completed age-appropriate assessments of mathematics, vocabulary and the personality trait conscientiousness. Eighth-grade students additionally completed a measure of life satisfaction, with both self-reports and parent reports of their grades from the previous semester also obtained. Higher education students additionally completed measures of positive and negative affect, and self-reported their grades and college entrance scores. Results: Obese students receive significantly lower grades in middle school (d=0.83), community college (d=0.34) and university (d=0.36), but show no statistically significant differences in intelligence or achievement test scores. Even after controlling for demographic variables, intelligence, personality and well-being, obese students obtain significantly lower grades than normal-weight students in the eighth grade (d=0.39), community college (d=0.42) and university (d=0.31). Conclusion: Lower grades may reflect peer and teacher prejudice against overweight and obese students rather than lack of ability among these students."
22472877,Is bipolar disorder more common in highly intelligent people? A cohort study of a million men,C R Gale,"Anecdotal and biographical reports have long suggested that bipolar disorder is more common in people with exceptional cognitive or creative ability. Epidemiological evidence for such a link is sparse. We investigated the relationship between intelligence and subsequent risk of hospitalisation for bipolar disorder in a prospective cohort study of 1,049,607 Swedish men. Intelligence was measured on conscription for military service at a mean age of 18.3 years and data on psychiatric hospital admissions over a mean follow-up period of 22.6 years was obtained from national records. Risk of hospitalisation with any form of bipolar disorder fell in a stepwise manner as intelligence increased (P for linear trend <0.0001). However, when we restricted analyses to men with no psychiatric comorbidity, there was a 'reversed-J' shaped association: men with the lowest intelligence had the greatest risk of being admitted with pure bipolar disorder, but risk was also elevated among men with the highest intelligence (P for quadratic trend=0.03), primarily in those with the highest verbal (P for quadratic trend=0.009) or technical ability (P for quadratic trend <0.0001). At least in men, high intelligence may indeed be a risk factor for bipolar disorder, but only in the minority of cases who have the disorder in a pure form with no psychiatric comorbidity."
22441891,"Sluggish cognitive tempo among young adolescents with ADHD: relations to mental health, academic, and social functioning",Stephen P Becker,"Objective: This study investigated the role of sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) in relation to externalizing and internalizing mental health problems, academic functioning, and social functioning among young adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: In all, 57 youth ages 10 to 14 participated in the study. Parents rated SCT, internalizing, and externalizing symptoms, as well as social and academic impairment. Teachers rated academic and peer impairment, and intelligence and academic achievement also were assessed. Results: Above and beyond ADHD and conduct problem symptoms, SCT was associated with internalizing mental health symptoms and social problems. The association between SCT and externalizing problems or academic functioning was not significant when accounting for ADHD symptomatology and intelligence. Conclusion: SCT is consistently associated with internalizing symptoms and is also associated with young adolescents' general social difficulties. When controlling for important related constructs, SCT is not associated with externalizing symptoms or academic impairment among young adolescents with ADHD."
22422007,Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis: a case report of a 33-year-old patient,Ilias Kosmidis,"Congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis is a type IV hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy, presenting early in life. This disorder results from defective neural crest differentiation with loss of the first-order afferent system, which is responsible for sensations of pain and temperature; a neuronal loss in the sympathetic ganglia is also present. A case of a 33-year-old patient with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis is presented. From the time of birth, he did not sweat and did not respond to painful stimuli, although unexplained bouts of fever were often observed in infancy; an extensive workup during childhood helped establish the diagnosis. Throughout childhood and adulthood, the patient presented multiple infections and fractures in various sites of his body, growth disturbances, and avascular necrosis, and Charcot arthropathies and joint dislocations mainly affected his elbow and hip joint. At the final follow-up, at the age of 33 years, he was found to be obese, with a limited social life. A Charcot elbow restricted the activity of his left upper limb, and the dislocated hips combined with the instability of the ankle joints limited the ambulation distance. A specific treatment protocol has not been established in the literature; the main principles that can be applied in patients with normal intelligence include training programs to prevent self-mutilation and accidental injuries and an early diagnosis and treatment of the infections."
22416265,Effects of social cognitive impairment on speech disorder in schizophrenia,Nancy M Docherty,"Disordered speech in schizophrenia impairs social functioning because it impedes communication with others. Treatment approaches targeting this symptom have been limited by an incomplete understanding of its causes. This study examined the process underpinnings of speech disorder, assessed in terms of communication failure. Contributions of impairments in 2 social cognitive abilities, emotion perception and theory of mind (ToM), to speech disorder were assessed in 63 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 21 nonpsychiatric participants, after controlling for the effects of verbal intelligence and impairments in basic language-related neurocognitive abilities. After removal of the effects of the neurocognitive variables, impairments in emotion perception and ToM each explained additional variance in speech disorder in the patients but not the controls. The neurocognitive and social cognitive variables, taken together, explained 51% of the variance in speech disorder in the patients. Schizophrenic disordered speech may be less a concomitant of ""positive"" psychotic process than of illness-related limitations in neurocognitive and social cognitive functioning."
22404243,Perceptual shifts of priority: a qualitative study bringing emotional intelligence to the foreground for nurses in talk-based therapy roles,J Hurley,"This paper presents the findings of a qualitative study conceptually framed by social constructionism that explored the experiences of mental health nurses engaging in talk-based therapy roles. Constructions from the participants' narratives are shown to have a powerful resonance with the construct of emotional intelligence, a resonance also echoed from the literature, and policies from the UK identified within the paper. Forwarded is that rather than prioritizing the development of technical approaches of specific therapies, nurses should equally be prepared for talk-based therapy roles through developing their emotionally intelligence capabilities."
22372869,Quality of life in newly diagnosed children with specific learning disabilities (SpLD) and differences from typically developing children: a study of child and parent reports,M Ginieri-Coccossis,"Introduction: Research on quality of life (QoL) of school children with specific learning disabilities (SpLD) and their parents is scarce. The present study explores QoL deficits in newly diagnosed children with SpLD and their parents, in comparison to a similar age group of typically developing children. Possible associations between parental and child QoL were statistically explored in both groups of children. Methods: 70 newly diagnosed children with SpLD [International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) criteria] (38 boys, 32 girls, mean age 10.1 years) and a control group of 69 typically developing children of the same age (40 boys, 29 girls, mean age 10.6 years) were recruited. Children were of normal intelligence quotient, attending mainstream schools. Their parents were also recruited so a child's scores could be associated with corresponding parental scores (mother or father). Children's QoL was assessed by the German questionnaire for measuring quality of life in children and adolescents (KINDL(R) ) questionnaire and parental QoL by World Health Organization Quality of Life brief questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) of the World Health Organization. Results: Children with SpLD in comparison to typically developing children reported according to the KINDL(R) measurement poorer emotional well-being, lower self-esteem and satisfaction in their relationships with family and friends. Surprisingly, school functioning was not reported by these children as an area of concern. Parents of children with SpLD indicated experiencing lower satisfaction in the WHOQOL-BREF domains of social relationships and environment. Correlational and regression analysis with parental-child QoL scores provided evidence that in the SpLD group, parental scores on WHOQOL-BREF social relationships and psychological health domains could be predictors of the child's emotional well-being, satisfaction with family, friends and school functioning. Stepwise regression analysis verified the effect of parents' WHOQOL-BREF social relationships domain on several dimensions of children's KINDL(R) QoL. Conclusions: The results may suggest certain significant effects of the SpLD condition on newly diagnosed children's QoL. Emotional and social deficits seem to be experienced by this cohort of children and their parents. Investigation into the possible interrelationships between parental and child QoL seems to indicate that parental social wellbeing may to a certain extend influence some dimensions of the child's QoL. The findings are useful for policy making and specialized interventions for children with SpLD and their families."
22371339,"Attachment and socio-emotional skills: a comparison of depressed inpatients, institutionalized delinquents and control adolescents",Marie Delhaye,"This study compared 50 depressed inpatients, 51 institutionalized delinquents and 51 control adolescents (total n = 152) regarding attachment and associated socio-emotional skills. All of the participants took an individual interview (i.e., anamnesis, diagnostic interview and intelligence test) and completed the attachment measure and self-report measures of socio-emotional skills (i.e., emotional intelligence, empathy and resilience). Results showed that controls scored higher on secure attachment, whereas both of the other groups scored higher on preoccupied attachment. Depressed adolescents had lower scores on emotional intelligence than did controls. Finally, depressed adolescents had lower scores than the other two groups on resilience. The anxious or preoccupied attachment in both clinical groups, the overall frailty of depressive adolescents and the apparent resilience of delinquent adolescents despite their cognitive limitations should inform the respective treatment plans for these groups of adolescents. Suggestions for future research into differences between depressed and delinquent adolescents are outlined. Key practitioner message: Both depressed and delinquent adolescents show more anxious attachment. Depressed adolescents are less resilient than delinquent adolescents. Delinquent adolescents are less intelligent than the other two groups but well-adjusted overall. These differences should inform treatment plans for these two clinical groups."
22368081,A gene-brain-cognition pathway: prefrontal activity mediates the effect of COMT on cognitive control and IQ,Adam E Green,"A core thesis of cognitive neurogenetic research is that genetic effects on cognitive ability are mediated by specific neural functions, however, demonstrating neural mediation has proved elusive. Pairwise relationships between genetic variation and brain function have yielded heterogeneous findings to date. This heterogeneity indicates that a multiple mediator modeling approach may be useful to account for complex relationships involving function at multiple brain regions. This is relevant not only for characterizing healthy cognition but for modeling the complex neural pathways by which disease-related genetic effects are transmitted to disordered cognitive phenotypes in psychiatric illness. Here, in 160 genotyped functional magnetic resonance imaging participants, we used a multiple mediator model to test a gene-brain-cognition pathway by which activity in 4 prefrontal brain regions mediates the effects of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene on cognitive control and IQ. Results provide evidence for gene-brain-cognition mediation and help delineate a pathway by which gene expression contributes to intelligence."
22352781,"Performances on five verbal fluency tests in a healthy, elderly Danish sample",Jette Stokholm,"Verbal fluency tests are widely used as measures of language and executive functions. This study presents data for five tests; semantic fluency (animals, supermarket items and alternating between cities and professions), lexical fluency (s-words), and action fluency (verbs) based on a sample of 100 cognitively intact elderly Danish subjects aged 60-87 years. We found mean scores similar to what has been reported from other countries. There was little influence of background variables: in four out of fives tests less than 20% of the variance could be explained by age, education, and estimated intelligence. Age had a greater impact than education on category based performance, while the opposite was the case for lexical- and action-based fluency. Overall, intelligence was of little importance. There was a positive and significant correlation between all tests, but with only low to moderate strength of association, indicating that various fluency tasks draw on different cognitive abilities and are not interchangeable."
22344813,Ventral striatal prediction error signaling is associated with dopamine synthesis capacity and fluid intelligence,Florian Schlagenhauf,"Fluid intelligence represents the capacity for flexible problem solving and rapid behavioral adaptation. Rewards drive flexible behavioral adaptation, in part via a teaching signal expressed as reward prediction errors in the ventral striatum, which has been associated with phasic dopamine release in animal studies. We examined a sample of 28 healthy male adults using multimodal imaging and biological parametric mapping with (1) functional magnetic resonance imaging during a reversal learning task and (2) in a subsample of 17 subjects also with positron emission tomography using 6-[(18) F]fluoro-L-DOPA to assess dopamine synthesis capacity. Fluid intelligence was measured using a battery of nine standard neuropsychological tests. Ventral striatal BOLD correlates of reward prediction errors were positively correlated with fluid intelligence and, in the right ventral striatum, also inversely correlated with dopamine synthesis capacity (FDOPA K inapp). When exploring aspects of fluid intelligence, we observed that prediction error signaling correlates with complex attention and reasoning. These findings indicate that individual differences in the capacity for flexible problem solving relate to ventral striatal activation during reward-related learning, which in turn proved to be inversely associated with ventral striatal dopamine synthesis capacity."
22344317,Cognitive deficits in adults with ADHD go beyond comorbidity effects,Katiane L Silva,"Objective: This study addresses if deficits in cognitive, attention, and inhibitory control performance in adults with ADHD are better explained by the disorder itself or by comorbid conditions. Method: Adult patients with ADHD (n = 352) and controls (n = 94) were evaluated in the ADHD program of a tertiary hospital. The diagnostic process for ADHD and comorbidities was based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) criteria. Stepwise regression analyses evaluated the effect of ADHD, demographics, and comorbidities on the scores from Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Continuous Performance Test, and Stroop Color and Word Test. Results: Patients with ADHD of both genders had worse performance on neuropsychological domains, even after adjustment for comorbidities. The presence of comorbid bipolar disorder and specific phobia are associated with more Stroop errors, whereas patients with generalized anxiety disorder present a longer execution time in Stroop. Conclusion: Neuropsychological deficits in adults with ADHD go beyond comorbidity. Specific comorbid disorders may influence the neuropsychological functioning in adults with ADHD."
22336479,Work readiness of graduate health professionals,Arlene Walker,"Background and aim: The current exploratory study investigated work readiness among graduate health professionals. Design and participants: A critical incident technique was used to elicit perceptions regarding: strategies and skills that constitute work readiness among health professionals and the work readiness factors that help or hinder health graduates' transition and integration into the workplace. Fifteen medical graduates, 26 nursing graduates and five organisational representatives from a regional hospital in Victoria, Australia participated. Method: Data were collected via qualitative interviews. Results: Participants discussed a total of 92 critical incidents; 52 related to helping and 40 to hindering work readiness factors that impacted graduates' transition and integration experiences. A follow-up thematic analysis indentified four critical work readiness factors: social intelligence, organisational acumen, work competence and personal characteristics. While graduates and organisational representatives considered each factor important, some differences between the groups emerged. Organisational representative's perceived social intelligence and clinical skills critical graduate competencies, yet graduates were unprepared in these areas. Conclusion: The identified work readiness factors were consistent with past research and warrant further investigation of work readiness among a larger group of graduate health professionals in a range of contexts."
22335467,Comparison of pervasive developmental disorder and schizophrenia by the Japanese version of the National Adult Reading Test,Toyosaku Ota,"Objective: In adults, it is sometimes difficult to discriminate between pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) and schizophrenia (SCH) when positive symptoms are not outstanding. We examined whether the Japanese version of the National Adult Reading Test (JART), is a valid scale for evaluating pre-morbid intelligence quotient (IQ) in patients with SCH, and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) are useful for helping to discriminate between PDD and SCH. Methods: Sixteen patients with adult PDD and 16 age-, education- and sex-matched patients with SCH participated in the present study. In addition, two groups were matched for JART and GAF scores. All subjects were scored on the JART and WAIS-R after informed consent on the aim of this study. Examiners who were blind to the diagnoses measured JART and WAIS-R. Results: Significant diagnosis-by-IQ examination interactions were found (F[1,30] = 10.049, P = 0.003). Furthermore, WAIS-R scores of the PDD group were higher than those of the SCH group (P = 0.002) considering two groups were matched for JART. Conclusions: The comparison of IQ in the PDD group and in the SCH group by JART and WAIS-R might be an easy and useful method for helping to discriminate between PDD and SCH."
22323120,Working memory and response inhibition as one integral phenotype of adult ADHD? A behavioral and imaging correlational investigation,Martin Schecklmann,"Objective: It is an open question whether working memory (WM) and response inhibition (RI) constitute one integral phenotype in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Method: The authors investigated 45 adult ADHD patients and 41 controls comparable for age, gender, intelligence, and education during a letter n-back and a stop-signal task, and measured prefrontal oxygenation by means of functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Results: The authors replicated behavioral and cortical activation deficits in patients compared with controls for both tasks and also for performance in both control conditions. In the patient group, 2-back performance was correlated with stop-signal reaction time. This correlation did not seem to be specific for WM and RI as 1-back performance was correlated with go reaction time. No significant correlations of prefrontal oxygenation between WM and RI were found. Conclusion: The authors' findings do not support the hypothesis of WM and RI representing one integral phenotype of ADHD mediated by the prefrontal cortex."
22311198,CAPD in 2nd-graders of primary schools: which tests discriminate normal from impaired children?],A Nickisch,"Background: Third- and fourth-graders with (C)APD can be differentiated from non-(C)APD children at best by means of 3 diagnostic tests (Nickisch & Kiese-Himmel, 2009). Now it should be examined which tests discriminate second graders with (C)APD from those without. MATERIAL UND METHODS: 10 audiological and psychometrical tests were used for this purpose. Patients: 33 second-graders of primary schools diagnosed with auditory-specific perceptual deficits (clinical group (C)APD: average age: 7.8; SD 0.7 years) were compared to 48 normally developed children of the same school grade (control group Non-(C)APD: average age: 7.6; SD 0.5 years). Results: With the exception of 3 non-language based tests significant group-differentiations appeared, with the (C)APD-children displaying worse results. The diagnostic classification succeeded in the following test-combination: Word-Understanding in Background Noise (Goettinger Sprachaudiometrie im Freifeld), Dichotic Listening (Uttenweiler Test), Numerical Sequence Memory (Subtest of the German version of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities), Nonword Repetition (Mottier-Test). 97.5% of all children were assigned to the correct diagnostic group (96.3% after cross-validation). Conclusion: After the exclusion of neurological disorders, peripheral hearing-disorders as well as intelligence-impairments the diagnostic assurance of (C)APD of second-graders succeeded, permitting very small probability of error. Compared to the preliminary study, an additional diagnostic test on second-graders is necessary; classification, as a result, will be more precise."
22286109,WISC-IV profiles are associated with differences in symptomatology and outcome in children with ADHD,Nicholas S Thaler,"Objective: The current study investigated the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) cluster profiles of children with ADHD to examine the association between IQ profiles and diagnostic frequency, symptomatology, and outcome in this population. Method: Hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted on 189 children with a diagnosis of ADHD-inattentive (ADHD-I) and ADHD-combined (ADHD-C) subtypes. Clusters were then compared across symptom rating scale factor scores, behavioral rating scales, and achievement scores. Results: A five-cluster solution was extracted. One cluster was identified to have reduced processing speed relative to other WISC-IV indexes and significantly higher ratings of inattention and incidence of ADHD-I diagnosis. A second cluster had impairments in processing speed and working memory and was associated with impaired behavioral functioning. Conclusion: Findings support a relationship between reduced processing speed and inattention and provide evidence that WISC-IV profiles may be helpful in predicting symptomatology and outcome in children with ADHD."
22267534,Cumulative genetic risk and prefrontal activity in patients with schizophrenia,Esther Walton,"The lack of consistency of genetic associations in highly heritable mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, remains a challenge in molecular psychiatry. Because clinical phenotypes for psychiatric disorders are often ill defined, considerable effort has been made to relate genetic polymorphisms to underlying physiological aspects of schizophrenia (so called intermediate phenotypes), that may be more reliable. Given the polygenic etiology of schizophrenia, the aim of this work was to form a measure of cumulative genetic risk and study its effect on neural activity during working memory (WM) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Neural activity during the Sternberg Item Recognition Paradigm was measured in 79 schizophrenia patients and 99 healthy controls. Participants were genotyped, and a genetic risk score (GRS), which combined the additive effects of 41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 34 risk genes for schizophrenia, was calculated. These risk SNPs were chosen according to the continuously updated meta-analysis of genetic studies on schizophrenia available at www.schizophreniaresearchforum.org. We found a positive relationship between GRS and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex inefficiency during WM processing. GRS was not correlated with age, performance, intelligence, or medication effects and did not differ between acquisition sites, gender, or diagnostic groups. Our study suggests that cumulative genetic risk, combining the impact of many genes with small effects, is associated with a known brain-based intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia. The GRS approach could provide an advantage over studying single genes in studies focusing on the genetic basis of polygenic conditions such as neuropsychiatric disorders."
22264351,Widespread and sustained cognitive deficits in alcoholism: a meta-analysis,Katherine Stavro,"The cognitive repercussions of alcohol dependence are well documented. However, the literature remains somewhat ambiguous with respect to which distinct cognitive functions are more susceptible to impairment in alcoholism and to how duration of abstinence affects cognitive recovery. Some theories claim alcohol negatively affects specific cognitive functions, while others assert that deficits are more diffuse in nature. This is the first meta-analysis to examine cognition in alcohol abuse/dependence and the duration of abstinence necessary to achieve cognitive recovery. A literature search yielded 62 studies that assessed cognitive dysfunction among alcoholics. Effect size estimates were calculated using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V2, for the following 12 cognitive domains: intelligence quotient, verbal fluency/language, speed of processing, working memory, attention, problem solving/executive functions, inhibition/impulsivity, verbal learning, verbal memory, visual learning, visual memory and visuospatial abilities. Within these 12 domains, three effect size estimates were calculated based on abstinence duration. The three groups were partitioned into short- (< 1 month), intermediate- (2 to 12 months) and long- (> 1 year) term abstinence. Findings revealed moderate impairment across 11 cognitive domains during short-term abstinence, with moderate impairment across 10 domains during intermediate term abstinence. Small effect size estimates were found for long-term abstinence. These results suggest significant impairment across multiple cognitive functions remains stable during the first year of abstinence from alcohol. Generally, dysfunction abates by 1 year of sobriety. These findings support the diffuse brain hypothesis and suggest that cognitive dysfunction may linger for up to an average of 1 year post-detoxification from alcohol."
22215222,Persons held in preventive detention (§ 66 Criminal Code): characteristics of offenders and the impact on prospects for successful completion of therapy],S K Gairing,"With its verdict in May 2011 the German Federal Constitutional Court declared the current law for preventive detention unconstitutional and obliged the legislative bodies to undertake a freedom- and treatment-oriented reform. Psychiatrists and psychotherapists are bound to provide therapeutic concepts. Currently there is a lack of information on the intended clientele. In our study we examined 26 persons serving preventive detention, 32 regular prisoners and 29 non-delinquent probands. The groups were matched according to age and intelligence. We gathered sociodemographic data, criminal records and conducted the tests SCID I, SCID II und PCL-R, K-FAF and BIS-11 to obtain diagnoses and characteristics. Based on this information, the HCR-20 and GAF were performed. In comparison to regular prisoners and non-delinquents, the group of those serving preventive detention is characterised by medium to advanced age, antisociality, psychopathy, substance abuse or addiction, aggressivity, a strong criminal record, years of imprisonment, insufficient educational and vocational training and a high risk of recidivism. In our examination of persons serving preventive detention, we demonstrate that this clientele is a group of recidivists difficult to treat. The current laws and a lack of early intervention programs have prevented and delayed their timely and possibly successful treatment. From a psychiatric point of view, there is a strong need for new therapeutic concepts to meet this challenge."
22141327,More academics in regular schools? The effect of regular versus special school placement on academic skills in Dutch primary school students with Down syndrome,G de Graaf,"Background: Studies from the UK have shown that children with Down syndrome acquire more academic skills in regular education. Does this likewise hold true for the Dutch situation, even after the effect of selective placement has been taken into account? Method: In 2006, an extensive questionnaire was sent to 160 parents of (specially and regularly placed) children with Down syndrome (born 1993-2000) in primary education in the Netherlands with a response rate of 76%. Questions were related to the child's school history, academic and non-academic skills, intelligence quotient, parental educational level, the extent to which parents worked on academics with their child at home, and the amount of academic instructional time at school. Academic skills were predicted with the other variables as independents. Results: For the children in regular schools much more time proved to be spent on academics. Academic performance appeared to be predicted reasonably well on the basis of age, non-academic skills, parental educational level and the extent to which parents worked at home on academics. However, more variance could be predicted when the total amount of years that the child spent in regular education was added, especially regarding reading and to a lesser extent regarding writing and math. In addition, we could prove that this finding could not be accounted for by endogenity. Conclusion: Regularly placed children with Down syndrome learn more academics. However, this is not a straight consequence of inclusive placement and age alone, but is also determined by factors such as cognitive functioning, non-academic skills, parental educational level and the extent to which parents worked at home on academics. Nevertheless, it could be proven that the more advanced academic skills of the regularly placed children are not only due to selective placement. The positive effect of regular school on academics appeared to be most pronounced for reading skills."
22139821,White matter structures associated with emotional intelligence: evidence from diffusion tensor imaging,Hikaru Takeuchi,"Previous studies of brain lesions, functional activity, and gray matter structures have suggested that emotional intelligence (EI) is associated with regions involved in the network of social cognition (SCN) and in somatic marker circuitry (SMC). Our new study is the first to investigate the association between white matter (WM) integrity and EI. We examined this relationship in the brain of healthy young adult men [n = 74, mean age = 21.5 years, standard deviation (SD) = 1.6] and women (n = 44, mean age = 21.9 years, SD = 1.4). We performed a voxel-based analysis of fractional anisotropy, which is an indicator of WM integrity, using diffusion tensor imaging and used a questionnaire (EI Scale) for measuring EI to identify the correlation of WM integrity with individual EI factor (intrapersonal, interpersonal, and situation management factors). Our results showed that (a) the intrapersonal factor of EI was positively correlated with WM integrity in the right anterior insula, and (b) the interpersonal factor of EI was associated with WM integrity in a part of the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). The right anterior insula is one of the important nodes of the SMC, whereas the ILF connects the visual cortex and areas related to SCN, and thus, is a part of the SCN. Our findings further support the notion that the brain regions involved in the SCN and in the SMC are associated with EI."
22076840,Common structural correlates of trait impulsiveness and perceptual reasoning in adolescence,Christina Schilling,"Background: Trait impulsiveness is a potential factor that predicts both substance use and certain psychiatric disorders. This study investigates whether there are common structural cerebral correlates of trait impulsiveness and cognitive functioning in a large sample of healthy adolescents from the IMAGEN project. Methods: Clusters of gray matter (GM) volume associated with trait impulsiveness, Cloningers' revised temperament, and character inventory impulsiveness (TCI-R-I) were identified in a whole brain analysis using optimized voxel-based morphometry in 115 healthy 14-year-olds. The clusters were tested for correlations with performance on the nonverbal tests (Block Design, BD; Matrix Reasoning, MT) of the Wechsler Scale of Intelligence for Children IV reflecting perceptual reasoning. Results: Cloningers' impulsiveness (TCI-R-I) score was significantly inversely associated with GM volume in left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Frontal clusters found were positively correlated with performance in perceptual reasoning tasks (Bonferroni corrected). No significant correlations between TCI-R-I and perceptual reasoning were observed. Conclusions: The neural correlate of trait impulsiveness in the OFC matches an area where brain function has previously been related to inhibitory control. Additionally, orbitofrontal GM volume was associated with scores for perceptual reasoning. The data show for the first time structural correlates of both cognitive functioning and impulsiveness in healthy adolescent subjects."
22057201,The identification and performance of gifted students with learning disability diagnoses: a quantitative synthesis,Benjamin J Lovett,"Much has been written about gifted students with learning disabilities, but there have been few large-scale empirical investigations, and the concept has proven controversial. The authors reviewed the available empirical literature on these students, focusing on (a) the criteria by which the students were identified and (b) the students' performance on standardized tests of ability and achievement. In addition, the test scores of these students were aggregated to determine typical performance levels. A total of 46 empirical articles were reviewed, and major findings included wide variability in identification criteria across studies, frequent reliance on dubious methods of learning disability identification, and a lack of academic impairment among the identified students. Implications for the ""gifted/LD"" category are discussed."
21976710,Social cognitive impairments and negative symptoms in schizophrenia: are there subtypes with distinct functional correlates?,Morris D Bell,"Social cognitive impairments and negative symptoms are core features of schizophrenia closely associated with impaired community functioning. However, little is known about whether these are independent dimensions of illness and if so, whether individuals with schizophrenia can be meaningfully classified based on these dimensions (SANS) and potentially differentially treated. Five social cognitive measures plus Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores in a sample of 77 outpatients produced 2 distinct factors--a social cognitive factor and a negative symptom factor. Factor scores were used in a cluster analysis, which yielded 3 well-defined groupings--a high negative symptom group (HN) and 2 low negative symptom groups, 1 with higher social cognition (HSC) and 1 with low social cognition (LSC). To make these findings more practicable for research and clinical settings, a rule of thumb for categorizing using only the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test and PANSS negative component was created and produced 84.4% agreement with the original cluster groups. An additional 63 subjects were added to cross validate the rule of thumb. When samples were combined (N = 140), the HSC group had significantly better quality of life and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores, higher rates of marriage and more hospitalizations. The LSC group had worse criminal and substance abuse histories. With 2 common assessment instruments, people with schizophrenia can be classified into 3 subgroups that have different barriers to community integration and could potentially benefit from different treatments."
21936766,The KCNH2 gene is associated with neurocognition and the risk of schizophrenia,Ryota Hashimoto,"Objectives: A genetic variant (rs3800779; M30) in the KCNH2 gene has been associated with schizophrenia, a lower intelligence quotient (IQ) and processing speed scores, altered brain functions and increased KCNH2-3.1. mRNA levels in the hippocampus. The aims of this study were to investigate whether the KCNH2 polymorphism is associated with schizophrenia-related neurocognitive deficits and to confirm the association between the variant and schizophrenia. Methods: The effects of the risk genotype on IQ and seven neurocognitive batteries were examined by the analysis of covariance in 191 healthy subjects. We performed a meta-analysis of the association between M30 and schizophrenia using five independent ethnic groups (1,720 cases; 2,418 controls). Results: Consistent with the previous study, we provided evidence that subjects with the risk T carriers had significantly lower IQ scores than those with the G/G genotype (P = 0.048). Of the seven neurocognitive batteries, subjects with the risk genotype demonstrated lower performances on attention/vigilance (P = 0.0079) and working memory (P = 0.0066) relative to subjects with the G/G genotype. Meta-analysis demonstrated evidence for an association between M30 and schizophrenia without showing heterogeneity across studies (odds ratio = 1.18; P = 0.0017). Conclusions: These data suggest that the KCNH2 polymorphism could be associated with schizophrenia-related neuropsychological deficits and the risk of developing schizophrenia."
21928903,"The associations between personality, diet and body mass index in older people",René Mõttus,"Objective: Personality traits are related to numerous health outcomes and health-related behaviors. To date, however, little is known about how personality traits are associated with dietary behavior, an important aspect of lifestyle in the current ""toxic food environment."" The present study investigated the associations of between Five-Factor Model personality traits, dietary patterns, and body mass index (BMI). Methods: The sample consisted of 1,091 members of Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 tested at age 70 years. Dietary patterns were measured using a detailed and validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Principal components analysis of the FFQ items identified four dietary dimensions, which were named 'Mediterranean style diet,' 'health aware diet,' 'convenience diet,' and 'sweet foods'. Personality traits were measured with NEO Five-Factor Inventory. The effects of childhood intelligence, education, and sex were controlled. Results: Endorsing the Mediterranean style diet dimension was associated with high Openness and Extraversion, and low Neuroticism. High scores on the health aware diet dimension were associated with high Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Endorsing the convenience diet dimension was associated with low Openness and high Neuroticism. Preference for sweet foods was associated with low Openness. High BMI was associated with high scores on the convenience diet dimension and low Conscientiousness. Conclusions: Personality traits, especially Openness, are associated with dietary patterns in older age. The pattern of findings may indicate that, in older people, dietary habits may be less related to how controlled they are and more related to their levels of openness and emotional and social adjustment. Policy implications are discussed."
21723361,Effects of docosahexaenoic acid and methylmercury on child's brain development due to consumption of fish by Finnish mother during pregnancy: a probabilistic modeling approach,O Leino,"Fish contains both beneficial substances e.g. docosahexaenoic acids but also harmful compounds e.g. methylmercury. Importantly, the health effects caused by these two substances can be evaluated in one common end point, intelligence quotient (IQ), providing a more transparent analysis. We estimated health effects of maternal fish consumption on child's central nervous system by creating a model with three alternative maternal fish consumption scenarios (lean fish, fatty fish, and current fish consumption). Additionally, we analyzed impacts of both regular fish consumption and extreme fish consumption habits. At the individual level, the simulated net effects were small, encompassing a range of one IQ point in all scenarios. Fatty fish consumption, however, clearly generated a beneficial net IQ effect, and lean fish consumption evoked an adverse net IQ effect. In view of the current fish consumption pattern of Finnish mothers the benefits and risks seem to more or less compensate each other. This study clearly shows the significance of which fish species are consumed during pregnancy and lactation, and the results can be generalized to apply to typical western population fish consumption habits."
