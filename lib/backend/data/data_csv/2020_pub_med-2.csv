32739882,Comparison and validation of seven white matter hyperintensities segmentation software in elderly patients,Quentin Vanderbecq,"Background: Manual segmentation is currently the gold standard to assess white matter hyperintensities (WMH), but it is time consuming and subject to intra and inter-operator variability. Purpose: To compare automatic methods to segment white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in the elderly in order to assist radiologist and researchers in selecting the most relevant method for application on clinical or research data. Material and methods: We studied a research dataset composed of 147 patients, including 97 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 2 database and 50 patients from ADNI 3 and a clinical routine dataset comprising 60 patients referred for cognitive impairment at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital (imaged using four different MRI machines). We used manual segmentation as the gold standard reference. Both manual and automatic segmentations were performed using FLAIR MRI. We compared seven freely available methods that produce segmentation mask and are usable by a radiologist without a strong knowledge of computer programming: LGA (Schmidt et al., 2012), LPA (Schmidt, 2017), BIANCA (Griffanti et al., 2016), UBO detector (Jiang et al., 2018), W2MHS (Ithapu et al., 2014), nicMSlesion (with and without retraining) (Valverde et al., 2019, 2017). The primary outcome for assessing segmentation accuracy was the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between the manual and the automatic segmentation software. Secondary outcomes included five other metrics. Results: A deep learning approach, NicMSlesion, retrained on data from the research dataset ADNI, performed best on this research dataset (DSC: 0.595) and its DSC was significantly higher than that of all others. However, it ranked fifth on the clinical routine dataset and its performance severely dropped on data with artifacts. On the clinical routine dataset, the three top-ranked methods were LPA, SLS and BIANCA. Their performance did not differ significantly but was significantly higher than that of other methods. Conclusion: This work provides an objective comparison of methods for WMH segmentation. Results can be used by radiologists to select a tool."
32739438,Time Analysis of Online Adaptive Magnetic Resonance-Guided Radiation Therapy Workflow According to Anatomical Sites,Görkem Güngör,"Purpose: To document time analysis of detailed workflow steps for the online adaptive magnetic resonance-guided radiation therapy treatments (MRgRT) with the ViewRay MRIdian system and to identify the barriers to and solutions for shorter treatment times. Methods and materials: A total of 154 patients were treated with the ViewRay MRIdian system between September 2018 and October 2019. The time process of MRgRT workflow steps of 962 fractions for 166 treatment sites was analyzed in terms of patient and online adaptive treatment (ART) characteristics. Results: Overall, 774 of 962 fractions were treated with online ART, and 83.2% of adaptive fractions were completed in less than 60 minutes. Sixty-three percent, 50.3%, and 4.2% of fractions were completed in less than 50 minutes, 45 minutes, and 30 minutes, respectively. Eight-point-three percent and 3% of fractions were completed in more than 70 minutes and 80 minutes, respectively. The median time (tmed) for ART workflow steps were as follows: (1) setup tmed: 5.0 minutes, (2) low-resolution scanning tmed: 1 minute, (3) high-resolution scanning tmed: 3 minutes, (4) online contouring tmed: 9 minutes, (5) reoptimization with online quality assurance tmed: 5 minutes, (6) real targeting tmed: 3 minutes, (7) beam delivery with gating tmed: 17 minutes, and (8) net total treatment time tmed: 45 minutes. The shortest and longest tmean rates of net total treatment time were 41.59 minutes and 64.43 minutes for upper-lung-lobe-located thoracic tumors and ultracentrally located thoracic tumors, respectively. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first broad treatment-time analysis for online ART in the literature. Although treatment times are long due to human- and technology-related limitations, benefits offered by MRgRT might be clinically important. In the future, implementation of artificial intelligence segmentation, an increase in dose rate, and faster multileaf collimator and gantry speeds may lead to achieving shorter MRgRT treatments."
32738664,"Emotional ""inflection point"" in public health emergencies with the 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in China",Yan Zhang,"Background: The outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in Wuhan, Hubei, has caused very serious consequences and severely affected people's lives and mental health. The outbreak will cause bad emotions such as tension, anxiety, fear, and so on. College students who have returned home from school face infection, isolation, and delay in starting school, and thus, their emotional stress should be observed. Methods: This study used self-designed questionnaires and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess and analyze the emotional state of over 30,000 college students during the outbreak period in January (T1) and home quarantine in February (T2). This survey used online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the emotion information of college students. Results: In the T1 survey, the ""Typhoon Eye Effect"" appeared. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. However, in T2, an emotional ""infection point"" appeared, there was an ""Exposure Effect"", the negative emotions of students in Hubei largely increased and became higher than students outside Hubei. Conclusion: This survey found that there is an emotional ""infection point"" in February among college students, especially in the Hubei area. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. In contrast, college students in Hubei were more nervous and scared than those outside Hubei in T2. This epidemic has caused the students to experience significant pressure and negative emotions. Therefore, universities and society should pay attention to their emotional adjustment, there are some suggestions such as establish the mental health organizations, test students' emotion status regularly."

32737415,Keratoconus-susceptibility gene identification by corneal thickness genome-wide association study and artificial intelligence IBM Watson,Yoshikatsu Hosoda,"Keratoconus is a common ocular disorder that causes progressive corneal thinning and is the leading indication for corneal transplantation. Central corneal thickness (CCT) is a highly heritable characteristic that is associated with keratoconus. In this two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CCT, we identified a locus for CCT, namely STON2 rs2371597 (P = 2.32 × 10-13), and confirmed a significant association between STON2 rs2371597 and keratoconus development (P = 0.041). Additionally, strong STON2 expression was observed in mouse corneal epithelial basal cells. We also identified SMAD3 rs12913547 as a susceptibility locus for keratoconus development using predictive analysis with IBM's Watson question answering computer system (P = 0.001). Further GWAS analyses combined with Watson could effectively reveal detailed pathways underlying keratoconus development."
32737379,Unbiased identification of novel subclinical imaging biomarkers using unsupervised deep learning,Sebastian M Waldstein,"Artificial intelligence has recently made a disruptive impact in medical imaging by successfully automatizing expert-level diagnostic tasks. However, replicating human-made decisions may inherently be biased by the fallible and dogmatic nature of human experts, in addition to requiring prohibitive amounts of training data. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised deep learning architecture particularly designed for OCT representations for unbiased, purely data-driven biomarker discovery. We developed artificial intelligence technology that provides biomarker candidates without any restricting input or domain knowledge beyond raw images. Analyzing 54,900 retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) volume scans of 1094 patients with age-related macular degeneration, we generated a vocabulary of 20 local and global markers capturing characteristic retinal patterns. The resulting markers were validated by linking them with clinical outcomes (visual acuity, lesion activity and retinal morphology) using correlation and machine learning regression. The newly identified features correlated well with specific biomarkers traditionally used in clinical practice (r up to 0.73), and outperformed them in correlating with visual acuity ([Formula: see text] compared to [Formula: see text] for conventional markers), despite representing an enormous compression of OCT imaging data (67 million voxels to 20 features). In addition, our method also discovered hitherto unknown, clinically relevant biomarker candidates. The presented deep learning approach identified known as well as novel medical imaging biomarkers without any prior domain knowledge. Similar approaches may be worthwhile across other medical imaging fields."
32737308,Explainable artificial intelligence model to predict acute critical illness from electronic health records,Simon Meyer Lauritsen,"Acute critical illness is often preceded by deterioration of routinely measured clinical parameters, e.g., blood pressure and heart rate. Early clinical prediction is typically based on manually calculated screening metrics that simply weigh these parameters, such as early warning scores (EWS). The predictive performance of EWSs yields a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity that can lead to negative outcomes for the patient. Previous work on electronic health records (EHR) trained artificial intelligence (AI) systems offers promising results with high levels of predictive performance in relation to the early, real-time prediction of acute critical illness. However, without insight into the complex decisions by such system, clinical translation is hindered. Here, we present an explainable AI early warning score (xAI-EWS) system for early detection of acute critical illness. xAI-EWS potentiates clinical translation by accompanying a prediction with information on the EHR data explaining it."
32736849,"How Outcome Uncertainty Mediates Attention, Learning, and Decision-Making",Ilya E Monosov,"Animals and humans evolved sophisticated nervous systems that endowed them with the ability to form internal-models or beliefs and make predictions about the future to survive and flourish in a world in which future outcomes are often uncertain. Crucial to this capacity is the ability to adjust behavioral and learning policies in response to the level of uncertainty. Until recently, the neuronal mechanisms that could underlie such uncertainty-guided control have been largely unknown. In this review, I discuss newly discovered neuronal circuits in primates that represent uncertainty about future rewards and propose how they guide information-seeking, attention, decision-making, and learning to help us survive in an uncertain world. Lastly, I discuss the possible relevance of these findings to learning in artificial systems."
32736779,Overview of risk assessment models for venous thromboembolism in ambulatory patients with cancer,Grigoris T Gerotziafas,"A B S T R A C T Important progress has been made in the development of risk assessment models (RAM) for the identification of outpatients on anticancer treatment at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Since the breakthrough publication of the original Khorana risk score (KRS) more than 10 years ago, a new generation of KRS-based scores have been developed, including the Vienna Cancer and Thrombosis Study, PROTECHT, CONKO, ONCOTEV, TicOnco and the CATS/MICA score. Among these the CATS/MICA score showed that a simplified score composed of only two calibrated predictors, the type of cancer and the D-dimer levels, offers a user-friendly tool for the evaluation of cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) risk. The COMPASS-CAT score is the first that introduced a more synthetic approach of risk evaluation by combining cancer-related predictors with patient comorbidity in a score which is designed for the types of cancer frequently seen in the community (i.e. breast, lung colon or ovarian cancers) and has been externally validated in independent studies. The Throly score is registered as part of the same group as it has a similar structure to the COMPASS-CAT score and is applicable in patients with lymphoma. The incorporation of specific biomarkers of hypercoagulability to the RAM for CAT offers the possibility to perform a precision medicine approach in the prevention of CAT. The improvement of RAM for CAT with artificial intelligence methodologies and deep learning techniques is the challenge in the near future."
32736589,Prediction of the development of acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery by machine learning,Po-Yu Tseng,"Background: Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is a major complication that results in increased morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery. Most established prediction models are limited to the analysis of nonlinear relationships and fail to fully consider intraoperative variables, which represent the acute response to surgery. Therefore, this study utilized an artificial intelligence-based machine learning approach thorough perioperative data-driven learning to predict CSA-AKI. Methods: A total of 671 patients undergoing cardiac surgery from August 2016 to August 2018 were enrolled. AKI following cardiac surgery was defined according to criteria from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). The variables used for analysis included demographic characteristics, clinical condition, preoperative biochemistry data, preoperative medication, and intraoperative variables such as time-series hemodynamic changes. The machine learning methods used included logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and ensemble (RF + XGboost). The performance of these models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We also utilized SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values to explain the prediction model. Results: Development of CSA-AKI was noted in 163 patients (24.3%) during the first postoperative week. Regarding the efficacy of the single model that most accurately predicted the outcome, RF exhibited the greatest AUC (0.839, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.772-0.898), whereas the AUC (0.843, 95% CI 0.778-0.899) of ensemble model (RF + XGboost) was even greater than that of the RF model alone. The top 3 most influential features in the RF importance matrix plot were intraoperative urine output, units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) transfused during surgery, and preoperative hemoglobin level. The SHAP summary plot was used to illustrate the positive or negative effects of the top 20 features attributed to the RF. We also used the SHAP dependence plot to explain how a single feature affects the output of the RF prediction model. Conclusions: In this study, machine learning methods were successfully established to predict CSA-AKI, which determines risks following cardiac surgery, enabling the optimization of postoperative treatment strategies to minimize the postoperative complications following cardiac surgeries."
34692154,A constructive model for collective intelligence,Wei Zhang,"Natural phenomena of collective intelligence (CI) occurring in physical space show a potential approach to effective large-scale human collaboration in cyberspace. Based on existing explanatory understanding of CI, this perspective proposes a constructive model for building artificial CI systems, i.e., problem-oriented CI phenomena with AI-powered information integration and feedback."
32735906,Detection of Progressive Glaucomatous Optic Nerve Damage on Fundus Photographs with Deep Learning,Felipe A Medeiros,"Purpose: To investigate whether predictions of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness obtained from a deep learning model applied to fundus photographs can detect progressive glaucomatous changes over time. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Participants: Eighty-six thousand one hundred twenty-three pairs of color fundus photographs and spectral-domain (SD) OCT images collected during 21 232 visits from 8831 eyes of 5529 patients with glaucoma or glaucoma suspects. Methods: A deep learning convolutional neural network was trained to assess fundus photographs and to predict SD OCT global RNFL thickness measurements. The model then was tested on an independent sample of eyes that had longitudinal follow-up with both fundus photography and SD OCT. The ability to detect eyes that had statistically significant slopes of SD OCT change was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The repeatability of RNFL thickness predictions was investigated by measurements obtained from multiple photographs that had been acquired during the same day. Main outcome measures: The relationship between change in predicted RNFL thickness from photographs and change in SD OCT RNFL thickness over time. Results: The test sample consisted of 33 466 pairs of fundus photographs and SD OCT images collected during 7125 visits from 1147 eyes of 717 patients. Eyes in the test sample were followed up for an average of 5.3 ± 3.3 years, with an average of 6.2 ± 3.8 visits. A significant correlation was found between change over time in predicted and observed RNFL thickness (r = 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.80; P < 0.001). Retinal nerve fiber layer predictions showed an ROC curve area of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.83-0.88) to discriminate progressors from nonprogressors. For detecting fast progressors (slope faster than 2 μm/year), the ROC curve area was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.98), with a sensitivity of 97% for 80% specificity and 85% for 90% specificity. For photographs obtained at the same visit, the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.946 (95% CI, 0.940-0.952), with a coefficient of variation of 3.2% (95% CI, 3.1%-3.3%). Conclusions: A deep learning model was able to obtain objective and quantitative estimates of RNFL thickness that correlated well with SD OCT measurements and potentially could be used to monitor for glaucomatous changes over time."
32735590,Competitive intelligence and its impact on innovations in tourism industry of China: An empirical research,Yanli Bao,"Competitive intelligence (CI) has attracted much attention in innovation research, but most of existing literature studies CI in technological innovations in manufacturing industry, with little empirical research in context of service businesses. This paper first analyzes CI of service businesses and then uses covariance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) on a data of 333 got from the survey in tourism enterprises of east China to test the effect of customer CI, opponent CI, and supplier CI on service innovations in China's service industry. Results show that opponent CI and supplier CI have positive influence on both exploratory and exploitative service innovation. Customer CI has more obvious positive influence on exploratory service innovation than on exploitative service innovation."
32735549,Prognostic Modeling of COVID-19 Using Artificial Intelligence in the United Kingdom: Model Development and Validation,Ahmed Abdulaal,"Background: The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a public health emergency and the case fatality rate in the United Kingdom is significant. Although there appear to be several early predictors of outcome, there are no currently validated prognostic models or scoring systems applicable specifically to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Objective: We aim to create a point-of-admission mortality risk scoring system using an artificial neural network (ANN). Methods: We present an ANN that can provide a patient-specific, point-of-admission mortality risk prediction to inform clinical management decisions at the earliest opportunity. The ANN analyzes a set of patient features including demographics, comorbidities, smoking history, and presenting symptoms and predicts patient-specific mortality risk during the current hospital admission. The model was trained and validated on data extracted from 398 patients admitted to hospital with a positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Patient-specific mortality was predicted with 86.25% accuracy, with a sensitivity of 87.50% (95% CI 61.65%-98.45%) and specificity of 85.94% (95% CI 74.98%-93.36%). The positive predictive value was 60.87% (95% CI 45.23%-74.56%), and the negative predictive value was 96.49% (95% CI 88.23%-99.02%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 90.12%. Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates an adaptive ANN trained on data at a single site, which demonstrates the early utility of deep learning approaches in a rapidly evolving pandemic with no established or validated prognostic scoring systems."
32735493,Artificial Intelligence in Lung Cancer: Bridging the Gap Between Computational Power and Clinical Decision-Making,Jaryd R Christie,"Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Recent advances in lung cancer screening, radiotherapy, surgical techniques, and systemic therapy have led to increasing complexity in diagnosis, treatment decision-making, and assessment of recurrence. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction models are being developed to address these issues and may have a future role in screening, diagnosis, treatment selection, and decision-making around salvage therapy. Imaging plays an essential role in all components of lung cancer management and has the potential to play a key role in AI applications. Artificial intelligence has demonstrated value in prognostic biomarker discovery in lung cancer diagnosis, treatment, and response assessment, putting it at the forefront of the next phase of personalized medicine. However, although exploratory studies demonstrate potential utility, there is a need for rigorous validation and standardization before AI can be utilized in clinical decision-making. In this review, we will provide a summary of the current literature implementing AI for outcome prediction in lung cancer. We will describe the anticipated impact of AI on the management of patients with lung cancer and discuss the challenges of clinical implementation of these techniques."
32735452,Utilizing Artificial Intelligence for Head and Neck Cancer Outcomes Prediction From Imaging,Tricia Chinnery,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models have become a growing area of interest in predictive medicine and have the potential to aid physician decision-making to improve patient outcomes. Imaging and radiomics play an increasingly important role in these models. This review summarizes recent developments in the field of radiomics for AI in head and neck cancer. Prediction models for oncologic outcomes, treatment toxicity, and pathological findings have all been created. Exploratory studies are promising; however, validation studies that demonstrate consistency, reproducibility, and prognostic impact remain uncommon. Prospective clinical trials with standardized procedures are required for clinical translation."
32734767,Patients' perspectives on radiation in health care,L A Hunt,"As radiation therapy is needed by approximately 50% of patients with cancer there needs to be ongoing research to ensure that radiation therapy targets the tumour effectively and minimises potential side effects. Major advances in radiation therapy, due to improvements in engineering and computing, have made it more precise, reducing side effects and improving cancer control. Patients need to be informed of its risks, both short and long term, to enable them to be active participants in their cancer treatment path."
32734760,Health care for deep space explorers,R B Thirsk,"[Formula: see text]There is a growing desire amongst space-faring nations to venture beyond the Van Allen radiation belts to a variety of intriguing locations in our inner solar system. Mars is the ultimate destination. In two decades, we hope to vicariously share in the adventure of an intrepid crew of international astronauts on the first voyage to the red planet.This will be a daunting mission with an operational profile unlike anything astronauts have flown before. A flight to Mars will be a 50-million-kilometre journey. Interplanetary distances are so great that voice and data communications between mission control on Earth and a base on Mars will feature latencies up to 20 min. Consequently, the ground support team will not have real-time control of the systems aboard the transit spacecraft nor the surface habitat. As cargo resupply from Earth will be impossible, the onboard inventory of equipment and supplies must be planned strategically in advance. Furthermore, the size, amount, and function of onboard equipment will be constrained by limited volume, mass, and power allowances.With less oversight from the ground, all vehicle systems will need to be reliable and robust. They must function autonomously. Astronauts will rely on their own abilities and onboard resources to deal with urgent situations that will inevitably arise.The deep space environment is hazardous. Zero- and reduced-gravity effects will trigger deconditioning of the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and other physiological systems. While living for 2.5 years in extreme isolation, Mars crews will experience psychological stressors such as loss of privacy, reduced comforts of living, and distant relationships with family members and friends.Beyond Earth's protective magnetosphere, the fluence of ionising radiation will be higher. Longer exposure of astronauts to galactic cosmic radiation could result in the formation of cataracts, impaired wound healing, and degenerative tissue diseases. Genetic mutations and the onset of cancer later in life are also possible. Acute radiation sickness and even death could ensue from a large and unpredictable solar particle event.There are many technological barriers that prevent us from carrying out a mission to Mars today. Before launching the first crew, we will need to develop processes for in-situ resource utilisation. Rather than bringing along large quantities of oxygen, water, and propellant from Earth, future astronauts will need to produce some of these consumables from local space-based resources.Ion propulsion systems will be needed to reduce travel times to interplanetary destinations, and we will need systems to land larger payloads (up to 40 tonnes of equipment and supplies for a human mission) on planetary surfaces. These and other innovations will be needed before humans venture into deep space.However, it is the delivery of health care that is regarded as one of the most important obstacles to be overcome. Physicians, biomedical engineers, human factors specialists, and radiation experts are re-thinking operational concepts of health care, crew performance, and life support. Traditional oversight of astronaut health by ground-based medical teams will no longer be possible, particularly in urgent situations. Aborting a deep space mission to medically evacuate an ill or injured crew member to Earth will not be an option. Future crews must have all of the capability and responsibility to monitor and manage their own health. Onboard medical resources must include imaging, surgery, and emergency care, as well as laboratory analysis of blood, urine, and other biospecimens.At least one member of the crew should be a broadly trained physician with experience in remote medicine. She/he will be supported by an onboard health informatics network that is artificial intelligence enabled to assist with monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment. In other words, health care in deep space will become more autonomous, intelligent, and point of care.The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has dedicated a day of its 5th International Symposium in Adelaide to the theme of Mars exploration. ICRP has brought global experts together today to consider the pressing issues of radiation protection. There are many issues to be addressed: Can the radiation countermeasures currently used in low Earth orbit be adapted for deep space?Can materials of low atomic weight be integrated into the structure of deep space vehicles to shield the crew?In the event of a major solar particle event, could a safe haven shelter the crew adequately from high doses of radiation?Could Martian regolith be used as shielding material for subterranean habitats?Will shielding alone be sufficient to minimise exposure, or will biological and pharmacological countermeasures also be needed?Beyond this symposium, I will value the continued involvement of ICRP in space exploration. ICRP has recently established Task Group 115 to examine radiation effects on the health of astronaut crew and to recommend exposure limits. This work will be vital. Biological effects of radiation could not only impact the health, well-being, and performance of future explorers, but also the length and quality of their lives.While humanity has dreamed of travel to the red planet for decades, an actual mission is finally starting to feel like a possibility. How exciting! I thank ICRP for its ongoing work to protect radiation workers on Earth. In the future, we will depend on counsel from ICRP to protect extraterrestrial workers and to enable the exploration of deep space."
32734566,Fluoride Exposure Affects Glutamine Uptake in Müller Glia Cells,Ana L García-López,"Fluoride, a pollutant present in contaminated ground water, oral care products, food, and pesticides, has deleterious effects in the structure and function of the central nervous system. Among the established neurological defects described in the exposed population, a reduced score in intelligence quotient tests in children of contaminated areas has gained attention over the past years. Maternal fluoride exposure during gestation decreases learning and memory abilities that correlate with a significant diminution of glutamate receptors expression. Since the involvement of glia cells in the maintenance and regulation of glutamatergic synapses is well-documented, in this contribution, we characterized the effect of fluoride exposure in the regulation of glia glutamine transporters. To this end, we used the Müller glia cell line, Mio-M1, and through the use of [3H]L-Glutamine uptake experiments and a Western blot approach, we demonstrate here the functional expression of system N of glutamine transporters, SNAT3 and SNAT5, in this model of human retina radial glia cells. Furthermore, these transporters interact with the glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid transporter 1, in an activity-dependent manner. Fluoride treatment reduces glutamine uptake and cell membrane [3H]glutamine surface binding, in good correlation with a decrease in SNAT3 and 5 protein levels. These results demonstrate that glia cells respond to the presence of fluoride reducing glutamine mobilization and by these means decreases glutamate turnover suggesting a disruption of glutamatergic transmission."
32734465,Emotional intelligence and eating disorders: a systematic review,Juana Romero-Mesa,"Background: Prior research indicates that deficits in emotional abilities are key predictors of the onset and maintenance of eating disorders (ED). As a relatively new emotion-related construct, emotional intelligence (EI) comprises a set of basic emotional abilities. Preliminary research suggests that deficits in EI are linked with disordered eating and other impulsive behaviours. Also, previous research reveals that emotional and socio-cognitive abilities, as well as ED symptomatology, varies across lifespan development. However, while the findings suggest promising results for the development of potential effective treatments for emotional deficits and disordered eating, it is difficult to summarise the relationship between EI and ED due to the diversity of theoretical approaches and variety of EI and ED measures. Objective: Our study, therefore, aimed to systematically review the current evidence on EI and ED in both the general and clinical populations and across different developmental stages. Methods: The databases examined were Medline, PsycInfo and Scopus, and 15 eligible articles were identified. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used. Results: All the studies reviewed indicated negative associations between EI and the dimensions of ED. Additionally, several mechanisms involved, namely adaptability, stress tolerance and emotional regulation were highlighted. Conclusion: The systematic review suggests promising but challenging preliminary evidence of the associations between EI and the dimensions of ED across diverse stages of development. In addition, future research, practical implications and limitations are discussed. Level of evidence i: Systematic review."
32734172,"Veterinary informatics: forging the future between veterinary medicine, human medicine, and One Health initiatives-a joint paper by the Association for Veterinary Informatics (AVI) and the CTSA One Health Alliance (COHA)",Jonathan L Lustgarten,"Objectives: This manuscript reviews the current state of veterinary medical electronic health records and the ability to aggregate and analyze large datasets from multiple organizations and clinics. We also review analytical techniques as well as research efforts into veterinary informatics with a focus on applications relevant to human and animal medicine. Our goal is to provide references and context for these resources so that researchers can identify resources of interest and translational opportunities to advance the field. Methods and results: This review covers various methods of veterinary informatics including natural language processing and machine learning techniques in brief and various ongoing and future projects. After detailing techniques and sources of data, we describe some of the challenges and opportunities within veterinary informatics as well as providing reviews of common One Health techniques and specific applications that affect both humans and animals. Discussion: Current limitations in the field of veterinary informatics include limited sources of training data for developing machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, siloed data between academic institutions, corporate institutions, and many small private practices, and inconsistent data formats that make many integration problems difficult. Despite those limitations, there have been significant advancements in the field in the last few years and continued development of a few, key, large data resources that are available for interested clinicians and researchers. These real-world use cases and applications show current and significant future potential as veterinary informatics grows in importance. Veterinary informatics can forge new possibilities within veterinary medicine and between veterinary medicine, human medicine, and One Health initiatives."
32734165,Estimating real-world performance of a predictive model: a case-study in predicting mortality,Vincent J Major,"Objective: One primary consideration when developing predictive models is downstream effects on future model performance. We conduct experiments to quantify the effects of experimental design choices, namely cohort selection and internal validation methods, on (estimated) real-world model performance. Materials and methods: Four years of hospitalizations are used to develop a 1-year mortality prediction model (composite of death or initiation of hospice care). Two common methods to select appropriate patient visits from their encounter history (backwards-from-outcome and forwards-from-admission) are combined with 2 testing cohorts (random and temporal validation). Two models are trained under otherwise identical conditions, and their performances compared. Operating thresholds are selected in each test set and applied to a ""real-world"" cohort of labeled admissions from another, unused year. Results: Backwards-from-outcome cohort selection retains 25% of candidate admissions (n = 23 579), whereas forwards-from-admission selection includes many more (n = 92 148). Both selection methods produce similar performances when applied to a random test set. However, when applied to the temporally defined ""real-world"" set, forwards-from-admission yields higher areas under the ROC and precision recall curves (88.3% and 56.5% vs. 83.2% and 41.6%). Discussion: A backwards-from-outcome experiment manipulates raw training data, simplifying the experiment. This manipulated data no longer resembles real-world data, resulting in optimistic estimates of test set performance, especially at high precision. In contrast, a forwards-from-admission experiment with a temporally separated test set consistently and conservatively estimates real-world performance. Conclusion: Experimental design choices impose bias upon selected cohorts. A forwards-from-admission experiment, validated temporally, can conservatively estimate real-world performance. Lay summary: The routine care of patients stands to benefit greatly from assistive technologies, including data-driven risk assessment. Already, many different machine learning and artificial intelligence applications are being developed from complex electronic health record data. To overcome challenges that arise from such data, researchers often start with simple experimental approaches to test their work. One key component is how patients (and their healthcare visits) are selected for the study from the pool of all patients seen. Another is how the group of patients used to create the risk estimator differs from the group used to evaluate how well it works. These choices complicate how the experimental setting compares to the real-world application to patients. For example, different selection approaches that depend on each patient's future outcome can simplify the experiment but are impractical upon implementation as these data are unavailable. We show that this kind of ""backwards"" experiment optimistically estimates how well the model performs. Instead, our results advocate for experiments that select patients in a ""forwards"" manner and ""temporal"" validation that approximates training on past data and implementing on future data. More robust results help gauge the clinical utility of recent works and aid decision-making before implementation into practice."
32734163,Artificial intelligence-based conversational agent to support medication prescribing,Anita M Preininger,"Objective: This article describes the system architecture, training, initial use, and performance of Watson Assistant (WA), an artificial intelligence-based conversational agent, accessible within Micromedex®. Materials and methods: The number and frequency of intents (target of a user's query) triggered in WA during its initial use were examined; intents triggered over 9 months were compared to the frequency of topics accessed via keyword search of Micromedex. Accuracy of WA intents assigned to 400 queries was compared to assignments by 2 independent subject matter experts (SMEs), with inter-rater reliability measured by Cohen's kappa. Results: In over 126 000 conversations with WA, intents most frequently triggered involved dosing (N = 30 239, 23.9%) and administration (N = 14 520, 11.5%). SMEs with substantial inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.71) agreed with intent mapping in 247 of 400 queries (62%), including 16 queries related to content that WA and SMEs agreed was unavailable in WA. SMEs found 57 (14%) of 400 queries incorrectly mapped by WA; 112 (28%) queries unanswerable by WA included queries that were either ambiguous, contained unrecognized typographical errors, or addressed topics unavailable to WA. Of the queries answerable by WA (288), SMEs determined 231 (80%) were correctly linked to an intent. Discussion: A conversational agent successfully linked most queries to intents in Micromedex. Ongoing system training seeks to widen the scope of WA and improve matching capabilities. Conclusion: WA enabled Micromedex users to obtain answers to many medication-related questions using natural language, with the conversational agent facilitating mapping to a broader distribution of topics than standard keyword searches."
32734161,Evaluation of an artificial intelligence clinical trial matching system in Australian lung cancer patients,Marliese Alexander,"Objective: The objective of this technical study was to evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based system for clinical trials matching for a cohort of lung cancer patients in an Australian cancer hospital. Methods: A lung cancer cohort was derived from clinical data from patients attending an Australian cancer hospital. Ten phases I-III clinical trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov and open to lung cancer patients at this institution were utilized for assessments. The trial matching system performance was compared to a gold standard established by clinician consensus for trial eligibility. Results: The study included 102 lung cancer patients. The trial matching system evaluated 7252 patient attributes (per patient median 74, range 53-100) against 11 467 individual trial eligibility criteria (per trial median 597, range 243-4132). Median time for the system to run a query and return results was 15.5 s (range 7.2-37.8). In establishing the gold standard, clinician interrater agreement was high (Cohen's kappa 0.70-1.00). On a per-patient basis, the performance of the trial matching system for eligibility was as follows: accuracy, 91.6%; recall (sensitivity), 83.3%; precision (positive predictive value), 76.5%; negative predictive value, 95.7%; and specificity, 93.8%. Discussion and conclusion: The AI-based clinical trial matching system allows efficient and reliable screening of cancer patients for clinical trials with 95.7% accuracy for exclusion and 91.6% accuracy for overall eligibility assessment; however, clinician input and oversight are still required. The automated system demonstrates promise as a clinical decision support tool to prescreen a large patient cohort to identify subjects suitable for further assessment."
32734155,Overcoming barriers to the adoption and implementation of predictive modeling and machine learning in clinical care: what can we learn from US academic medical centers?,Joshua Watson,"There is little known about how academic medical centers (AMCs) in the US develop, implement, and maintain predictive modeling and machine learning (PM and ML) models. We conducted semi-structured interviews with leaders from AMCs to assess their use of PM and ML in clinical care, understand associated challenges, and determine recommended best practices. Each transcribed interview was iteratively coded and reconciled by a minimum of 2 investigators to identify key barriers to and facilitators of PM and ML adoption and implementation in clinical care. Interviews were conducted with 33 individuals from 19 AMCs nationally. AMCs varied greatly in the use of PM and ML within clinical care, from some just beginning to explore their utility to others with multiple models integrated into clinical care. Informants identified 5 key barriers to the adoption and implementation of PM and ML in clinical care: (1) culture and personnel, (2) clinical utility of the PM and ML tool, (3) financing, (4) technology, and (5) data. Recommendation to the informatics community to overcome these barriers included: (1) development of robust evaluation methodologies, (2) partnership with vendors, and (3) development and dissemination of best practices. For institutions developing clinical PM and ML applications, they are advised to: (1) develop appropriate governance, (2) strengthen data access, integrity, and provenance, and (3) adhere to the 5 rights of clinical decision support. This article highlights key challenges of implementing PM and ML in clinical care at AMCs and suggests best practices for development, implementation, and maintenance at these institutions."
32733918,"Allosteric Regulation at the Crossroads of New Technologies: Multiscale Modeling, Networks, and Machine Learning",Gennady M Verkhivker,"Allosteric regulation is a common mechanism employed by complex biomolecular systems for regulation of activity and adaptability in the cellular environment, serving as an effective molecular tool for cellular communication. As an intrinsic but elusive property, allostery is a ubiquitous phenomenon where binding or disturbing of a distal site in a protein can functionally control its activity and is considered as the ""second secret of life."" The fundamental biological importance and complexity of these processes require a multi-faceted platform of synergistically integrated approaches for prediction and characterization of allosteric functional states, atomistic reconstruction of allosteric regulatory mechanisms and discovery of allosteric modulators. The unifying theme and overarching goal of allosteric regulation studies in recent years have been integration between emerging experiment and computational approaches and technologies to advance quantitative characterization of allosteric mechanisms in proteins. Despite significant advances, the quantitative characterization and reliable prediction of functional allosteric states, interactions, and mechanisms continue to present highly challenging problems in the field. In this review, we discuss simulation-based multiscale approaches, experiment-informed Markovian models, and network modeling of allostery and information-theoretical approaches that can describe the thermodynamics and hierarchy allosteric states and the molecular basis of allosteric mechanisms. The wealth of structural and functional information along with diversity and complexity of allosteric mechanisms in therapeutically important protein families have provided a well-suited platform for development of data-driven research strategies. Data-centric integration of chemistry, biology and computer science using artificial intelligence technologies has gained a significant momentum and at the forefront of many cross-disciplinary efforts. We discuss new developments in the machine learning field and the emergence of deep learning and deep reinforcement learning applications in modeling of molecular mechanisms and allosteric proteins. The experiment-guided integrated approaches empowered by recent advances in multiscale modeling, network science, and machine learning can lead to more reliable prediction of allosteric regulatory mechanisms and discovery of allosteric modulators for therapeutically important protein targets."
32733609,Models of necessity,Timothy Clark,"The way chemists represent chemical structures as two-dimensional sketches made up of atoms and bonds, simplifying the complex three-dimensional molecules comprising nuclei and electrons of the quantum mechanical description, is the everyday language of chemistry. This language uses models, particularly of bonding, that are not contained in the quantum mechanical description of chemical systems, but has been used to derive machine-readable formats for storing and manipulating chemical structures in digital computers. This language is fuzzy and varies from chemist to chemist but has been astonishingly successful and perhaps contributes with its fuzziness to the success of chemistry. It is this creative imagination of chemical structures that has been fundamental to the cognition of chemistry and has allowed thought experiments to take place. Within the everyday language, the model nature of these concepts is not always clear to practicing chemists, so that controversial discussions about the merits of alternative models often arise. However, the extensive use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in chemistry, with the aim of being able to make reliable predictions, will require that these models be extended to cover all relevant properties and characteristics of chemical systems. This, in turn, imposes conditions such as completeness, compactness, computational efficiency and non-redundancy on the extensions to the almost universal Lewis and VSEPR bonding models. Thus, AI and ML are likely to be important in rationalizing, extending and standardizing chemical bonding models. This will not affect the everyday language of chemistry but may help to understand the unique basis of chemical language."
32733359,"Tuberous Sclerosis Complex-Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (TAND): New Findings on Age, Sex, and Genotype in Relation to Intellectual Phenotype",Petrus J de Vries,"Background: Knowledge is increasing about TSC-Associated Neuropsychiatric Disorders (TAND), but little is known about the potentially confounding effects of intellectual ability (IA) on the rates of TAND across age, sex, and genotype. We evaluated TAND in (a) children vs. adults, (b) males vs. females, and (c) TSC1 vs. TSC2 mutations, after stratification for levels of IA, in a large, international cohort. Methods: Individuals of any age with a documented visit for TSC in the 12 months prior to enrolment were included. Frequency and percentages of baseline TAND manifestations were presented by categories of IA (no intellectual disability [ID, intelligence quotient (IQ)>70]; mild ID [IQ 50-70]; moderate-to-profound ID [IQ<50]). Chi-square tests were used to test associations between ID and TAND manifestations. The association between TAND and age (children vs. adults), sex (male vs. female), and genotype (TSC1 vs. TSC2) stratified by IA levels were examined using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests. Results: Eight hundred and ninety four of the 2,211 participants had formal IQ assessments. There was a significant association (P < 0.05) between levels of IA and the majority of TAND manifestations, except impulsivity (P = 0.12), overactivity (P = 0.26), mood swings (P = 0.08), hallucinations (P = 0.20), psychosis (P = 0.06), depressive disorder (P = 0.23), and anxiety disorder (P = 0.65). Once controlled for IA, children had higher rates of overactivity, but most behavioral difficulties were higher in adults. At the psychiatric level, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was seen at higher rates in children while anxiety and depressive disorders were observed at higher rates in adults. Compared to females, males showed significantly higher rates of impulsivity and overactivity, as well as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and ADHD. No significant age or sex differences were observed for academic difficulties or neuropsychological deficits. After controlling for IA no genotype-TAND associations were observed, except for higher rates of self-injury in individuals with TSC2 mutations. Conclusions: Findings suggest IA as risk marker for most TAND manifestations. We provide the first evidence of male preponderance of ASD and ADHD in individuals with TSC. The study also confirms the association between TSC2 and IA but, once controlling for IA, disproves the previously reported TSC2 association with ASD and with most other TAND manifestations."
32733351,Macphail's Null Hypothesis of Vertebrate Intelligence: Insights From Avian Cognition,Amalia P M Bastos,"Macphail famously criticized two foundational assumptions that underlie the evolutionary approach to comparative psychology: that there are differences in intelligence across species, and that intelligent behavior in animals is based on more than associative learning. Here, we provide evidence from recent work in avian cognition that supports both these assumptions: intelligence across species varies, and animals can perform intelligent behaviors that are not guided solely by associative learning mechanisms. Finally, we reflect on the limitations of comparative psychology that led to Macphail's claims and suggest strategies researchers can use to make more advances in the field."
32733302,The Dark Side of Emotion Recognition - Evidence From Cross-Cultural Research in Germany and China,Helena S Schmitt,"Background: The dark triad of personality (DT) comprises three antisocial personality traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) that are characterized by callousness and the motive to elevate the self while derogating other people. Previous research indicates that the positive relationship between the DT traits and interpersonally deviant behaviors is especially pronounced at high levels of emotional abilities. This has also been referred to as dark Emotional Intelligence (EI). Since prior studies predominantly examined dark EI via trait-approach, the present study targeted at providing evidence for dark EI using a behavioral measure of EI, namely emotion recognition performance. In order to study the robustness and cross-cultural validity of findings, parallel investigations were conducted in Germany and China. Methods: A total of N = 198 German (age: M = 23.40, SD = 5.88, 130 female) and N = 223 Chinese (age: M = 19.01, SD = 1.06, 105 female) participants took part in an online survey and completed a set of questionnaires in German and Mandarin translations, respectively. DT traits were assessed by means of the Short Dark Triad Scale. As a behavioral measure of emotional abilities, participants completed the Eyes Test for pairs of eyes of Caucasian and Asian models. Moreover, participants filled in the Emotional Manipulation Scale for the assessment of emotionally manipulative tactics. Results: Effects were highly gender- and culture-dependent. Among German females, Machiavellianism and narcissism showed the strongest positive associations with emotionally manipulative tactics at high levels of emotion recognition performance. A similar pattern of results was found among German males for psychopathy. None of the effects was observed in the Chinese female or male samples. Discussion: The present findings indicate that emotional abilities may constitute risk factors with the potential to promote rather than to prevent deviant behaviors especially in samples from Western cultures with pronounced scores on DT personality traits. Limitations and psychometric properties are discussed."
32732276,Artificial Intelligence in Neuroradiology: Current Status and Future Directions,Y W Lui,"Fueled by new techniques, computational tools, and broader availability of imaging data, artificial intelligence has the potential to transform the practice of neuroradiology. The recent exponential increase in publications related to artificial intelligence and the central focus on artificial intelligence at recent professional and scientific radiology meetings underscores the importance. There is growing momentum behind leveraging artificial intelligence techniques to improve workflow and diagnosis and treatment and to enhance the value of quantitative imaging techniques. This article explores the reasons why neuroradiologists should care about the investments in new artificial intelligence applications, highlights current activities and the roles neuroradiologists are playing, and renders a few predictions regarding the near future of artificial intelligence in neuroradiology."
32731878,Artificial neural networks improve early outcome prediction and risk classification in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients admitted to intensive care,Jesper Johnsson,"Background: Pre-hospital circumstances, cardiac arrest characteristics, comorbidities and clinical status on admission are strongly associated with outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Early prediction of outcome may inform prognosis, tailor therapy and help in interpreting the intervention effect in heterogenous clinical trials. This study aimed to create a model for early prediction of outcome by artificial neural networks (ANN) and use this model to investigate intervention effects on classes of illness severity in cardiac arrest patients treated with targeted temperature management (TTM). Methods: Using the cohort of the TTM trial, we performed a post hoc analysis of 932 unconscious patients from 36 centres with OHCA of a presumed cardiac cause. The patient outcome was the functional outcome, including survival at 180 days follow-up using a dichotomised Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) scale with good functional outcome defined as CPC 1-2 and poor functional outcome defined as CPC 3-5. Outcome prediction and severity class assignment were performed using a supervised machine learning model based on ANN. Results: The outcome was predicted with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.891 using 54 clinical variables available on admission to hospital, categorised as background, pre-hospital and admission data. Corresponding models using background, pre-hospital or admission variables separately had inferior prediction performance. When comparing the ANN model with a logistic regression-based model on the same cohort, the ANN model performed significantly better (p = 0.029). A simplified ANN model showed promising performance with an AUC above 0.852 when using three variables only: age, time to ROSC and first monitored rhythm. The ANN-stratified analyses showed similar intervention effect of TTM to 33 °C or 36 °C in predefined classes with different risk of a poor outcome. Conclusion: A supervised machine learning model using ANN predicted neurological recovery, including survival excellently, and outperformed a conventional model based on logistic regression. Among the data available at the time of hospitalisation, factors related to the pre-hospital setting carried most information. ANN may be used to stratify a heterogenous trial population in risk classes and help determine intervention effects across subgroups."
32731841,Colon capsule endoscopy versus CT colonography after incomplete colonoscopy. Application of artificial intelligence algorithms to identify complete colonic investigations,U Deding,"Background: Guidelines suggest computed tomography colonography (CTC) following incomplete optical colonoscopy (OC). Colon capsule endoscopies (CCE) have been suggested as an alternative, although completion rates have been unsatisfactory. Introduction of artificial intelligence (AI)-based localization algorithms of the camera capsules may enable identification of incomplete CCE investigations overlapping with incomplete OCs. Objective: The study aims to investigate relative sensitivity of CCE compared with CTC following incomplete OC, investigate the completion rate when combining results from the incomplete OC and CCE, and develop a forward-tracking algorithm ensuring a safe completeness of combined investigations. Methods: In this prospective paired study, patients with indication for CTC following incomplete OC were included for CCE and CTC. Location of CCE abortion and OC abortion were registered to identify complete combined investigations. AI-based algorithm for localization of capsules were developed reconstructing the passage of the colon. Results: In 237 individuals with CTC indication; 105 were included, of which 97 underwent both a CCE and CTC. CCE was complete in 66 (68%). Including CCEs which reached most oral point of incomplete OC, 73 (75%) had complete colonic investigations; 78 (80%) had conclusive investigations. Relative sensitivity of CCE compared with CTC was 2.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.76;4.04) for polyps >5 mm and 1.91 (95% CI 1.18;3.09) for polyps >9 mm. An AI-based algorithm was developed. Conclusion: Sensitivity of CCE following incomplete OC was superior to CTC. Introducing and improving algorithm-based localization of capsule abortion may increase identification of overall complete investigation rates following incomplete OC.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02826993."
32731462,FPGA-Based Implementation of Stochastic Configuration Networks for Regression Prediction,Yunqi Gao,"The implementation of neural network regression prediction based on digital circuits is one of the challenging problems in the field of machine learning and cognitive recognition, and it is also an effective way to relieve the pressure of the Internet in the era of intelligence. As a nonlinear network, the stochastic configuration network (SCN) is considered to be an effective method for regression prediction due to its good performance in learning and generalization. Therefore, in this paper, we adapt the SCN to regression analysis, and design and verify the field programmable gate array (FPGA) framework to implement SCN model for the first time. In addition, in order to improve the performance of the SCN model based on the FPGA, the implementation of the nonlinear activation function on the FPGA is optimized, which effectively improves the prediction accuracy while considering the utilization rate of hardware resources. Experimental results based on the simulation data set and the real data set prove that the proposed FPGA framework successfully implements the SCN regression prediction model, and the improved SCN model has higher accuracy and a more stable performance. Compared with the extreme learning machine (ELM), the prediction performance of the proposed SCN implementation model based on the FPGA for the simulation data set and the real data set is improved by 56.37% and 17.35%, respectively."
32731340,Survival from Cervical Cancer Diagnosed Aged 20-29 Years by Age at First Invitation to Screening in England: Population-Based Study,Alejandra Castanon,"Age at which women are first invited to attend cervical screening in England has changed twice: in 2004, women under 25 years were no longer invited; and in 2012, first invitations were sent six months earlier (at age 24.5 years). Concomitantly, a dramatic increase in screen-detected cervical cancer was observed, and their survival had not been documented. Diagnoses of invasive cervical cancer at ages 20-29 years in 2006-2016 in England were followed until the end of 2018 for deaths. We estimated 8-year overall survival (OS) by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and age at first screening invitation. Overall and relative survival for stage IA cervical cancer for women diagnosed aged 20-29 years in England (n = 1905) was excellent at 99.8% (95% confidence intervals (CI): 99.4-99.9%) and 100% (95% CI: 99.7-100.1%), respectively. OS for stage IB cervical cancer (n = 1101) was 90.4% (95% CI: 88.3-92.2%). Survival from stage IB was worse for women diagnosed age 20-24 years compared to those diagnosed 25-29 years at diagnosis (p < 0.0001), but no difference was observed by age at first invitation for screening, p = 0.8575. OS for stage II (65.5%, 95% CI: 60.2-72.0%) and stage III+ (36.6%, 95% CI 28.4-44.7%) were poorer. Survival from stage I cervical cancer in young women in England is excellent: mortality in women with stage IA cancer is akin to that of the general population regardless of age at first invitation to screening."
32730214,"A Rapid, Accurate and Machine-Agnostic Segmentation and Quantification Method for CT-Based COVID-19 Diagnosis",Longxi Zhou,"COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic and become the most urgent threat to the entire world. Tremendous efforts and resources have been invested in developing diagnosis, prognosis and treatment strategies to combat the disease. Although nucleic acid detection has been mainly used as the gold standard to confirm this RNA virus-based disease, it has been shown that such a strategy has a high false negative rate, especially for patients in the early stage, and thus CT imaging has been applied as a major diagnostic modality in confirming positive COVID-19. Despite the various, urgent advances in developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided systems for CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis, most of the existing methods can only perform classification, whereas the state-of-the-art segmentation method requires a high level of human intervention. In this paper, we propose a fully-automatic, rapid, accurate, and machine-agnostic method that can segment and quantify the infection regions on CT scans from different sources. Our method is founded upon two innovations: 1) the first CT scan simulator for COVID-19, by fitting the dynamic change of real patients' data measured at different time points, which greatly alleviates the data scarcity issue; and 2) a novel deep learning algorithm to solve the large-scene-small-object problem, which decomposes the 3D segmentation problem into three 2D ones, and thus reduces the model complexity by an order of magnitude and, at the same time, significantly improves the segmentation accuracy. Comprehensive experimental results over multi-country, multi-hospital, and multi-machine datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the existing ones and suggest its important application value in combating the disease."
32730066,Partisan ideological attitudes: Liberals are tolerant; the intelligent are intolerant,Yoav Ganzach,"In this article we examine intolerance toward ideological outgroups, conceptualized as the negativity of the attitudes of liberals and conservatives toward their ideological outgroup. We show that conservatives are more ideologically intolerant than liberals and that the more intelligent are more ideologically intolerant than the less intelligent. We also show that the differences between liberals and conservatives and the differences between the more and less intelligent depend on ideological extremity: They are larger for extreme than for moderate ideologists. The implication of these results to questions regarding the relationship between intelligence and ideological intolerance and regarding the relationship between ideology and prejudice are discussed.

32729810,Automated Assessment of COVID-19 Reporting and Data System and Chest CT Severity Scores in Patients Suspected of Having COVID-19 Using Artificial Intelligence,Nikolas Lessmann,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread across the globe with alarming speed, morbidity, and mortality. Immediate triage of patients with chest infections suspected to be caused by COVID-19 using chest CT may be of assistance when results from definitive viral testing are delayed. Purpose To develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) system to score the likelihood and extent of pulmonary COVID-19 on chest CT scans using the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) and CT severity scoring systems. Materials and Methods The CO-RADS AI system consists of three deep-learning algorithms that automatically segment the five pulmonary lobes, assign a CO-RADS score for the suspicion of COVID-19, and assign a CT severity score for the degree of parenchymal involvement per lobe. This study retrospectively included patients who underwent a nonenhanced chest CT examination because of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 at two medical centers. The system was trained, validated, and tested with data from one of the centers. Data from the second center served as an external test set. Diagnostic performance and agreement with scores assigned by eight independent observers were measured using receiver operating characteristic analysis, linearly weighted κ values, and classification accuracy. Results A total of 105 patients (mean age, 62 years ± 16 [standard deviation]; 61 men) and 262 patients (mean age, 64 years ± 16; 154 men) were evaluated in the internal and external test sets, respectively. The system discriminated between patients with COVID-19 and those without COVID-19, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.98) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.93), for the internal and external test sets, respectively. Agreement with the eight human observers was moderate to substantial, with mean linearly weighted κ values of 0.60 ± 0.01 for CO-RADS scores and 0.54 ± 0.01 for CT severity scores. Conclusion With high diagnostic performance, the CO-RADS AI system correctly identified patients with COVID-19 using chest CT scans and assigned standardized CO-RADS and CT severity scores that demonstrated good agreement with findings from eight independent observers and generalized well to external data. © RSNA, 2020 Supplemental material is available for this article."
32729664,Adjusting for allometric scaling in ABIDE I challenges subcortical volume differences in autism spectrum disorder,Camille Michèle Williams,"Inconsistencies across studies investigating subcortical correlates of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may stem from small sample size, sample heterogeneity, and omitting or linearly adjusting for total brain volume (TBV). To properly adjust for TBV, brain allometry-the nonlinear scaling relationship between regional volumes and TBV-was considered when examining subcortical volumetric differences between typically developing (TD) and ASD individuals. Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I; N = 654) data was analyzed with two methodological approaches: univariate linear mixed effects models and multivariate multiple group confirmatory factor analyses. Analyses were conducted on the entire sample and in subsamples based on age, sex, and full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ). A similar ABIDE I study was replicated and the impact of different TBV adjustments on neuroanatomical group differences was investigated. No robust subcortical allometric or volumetric group differences were observed in the entire sample across methods. Exploratory analyses suggested that allometric scaling and volume group differences may exist in certain subgroups defined by age, sex, and/or FSIQ. The type of TBV adjustment influenced some reported volumetric and scaling group differences. This study supports the absence of robust volumetric differences between ASD and TD individuals in the investigated volumes when adjusting for brain allometry, expands the literature by finding no group difference in allometric scaling, and further suggests that differing TBV adjustments contribute to the variability of reported neuroanatomical differences in ASD."
32729531,Artificial intelligence biosensors: Challenges and prospects,Xiaofeng Jin,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and wearable sensors are two essential fields to realize the goal of tailoring the best precision medicine treatment for individual patients. Integration of these two fields enables better acquisition of patient data and improved design of wearable sensors for monitoring the wearers' health, fitness and their surroundings. Currently, as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data and big health move from concept to implementation, AI-biosensors with appropriate technical characteristics are facing new opportunities and challenges. In this paper, the most advanced progress made in the key phases for future wearable and implantable technology from biosensing, wearable biosensing to AI-biosensing is summarized. Without a doubt, material innovation, biorecognition element, signal acquisition and transportation, data processing and intelligence decision system are the most important parts, which are the main focus of the discussion. The challenges and opportunities of AI-biosensors moving forward toward future medicine devices are also discussed."
32729409,Forensic DNA phenotyping and its politics of legitimation and contestation: Views of forensic geneticists in Europe,Rafaela Granja,"Forensic DNA Phenotyping (FDP) is a set of techniques that aim to infer externally visible characteristics in humans - such as eye, hair and skin color - and biogeographical ancestry of an unknown person, based on biological material. FDP has been applied in various jurisdictions in a limited number of high-profile cases to provide intelligence for criminal investigations. There are on-going controversies about the reliability and validity of FDP, which come together with debates about the ethical challenges emerging from the use of this technology in the criminal justice system. Our study explores how, in the context of complex politics of legitimation of and contestation over the use of FDP, forensic geneticists in Europe perceive this technology's potential applications, utility and risks. Forensic geneticists perform several forms of discursive boundary work, making distinctions between science and the criminal justice system, experts and non-experts, and good and bad science. Such forms of boundary work reconstruct the complex positioning vis-à-vis legal and scientific realities. In particular, while mobilizing interest in FDP, forensic geneticists simultaneously carve out notions of risk, accountability and scientific conduct that perform distance from FDP' implications in the criminal justice system."
32729148,Sharing and modifying stories in neonatal peer support: an international mixed-methods study,Gill Thomson,"While shared personal experiences are a valued prerequisite of the peer supporter-service-user relationship, they have the potential to create harm. There are challenges in peer supporters being emotionally ready to hear the experiences of others, and how much personal information peers should disclose. As part of an international study that aimed to explore how peer supporters who worked in a neonatal context (providing support to parents whose infant(s) has received neonatal care) were trained and supported, new insights emerged into how peers' personal stories were used and modified to instil boundaries in peer support services. In this paper, we report on a secondary analysis of the data to describe how peer supporters' stories were valued, used, assessed and moderated in neonatal peer support services; to safeguard and promote positive outcomes for peers and parents. Following University ethics approval, a mixed-methods study comprising online surveys and follow-up interviews was undertaken. Surveys were distributed through existing contacts and via social media. Thirty-one managers/coordinators/trainers and 77 peer supporters completed the survey from 48 peer support services in 16 different countries, and 26 interviews were held with 27 survey respondents. Three themes describe variations in the types of stories that were preferred and when peers were perceived to be 'ready' to share them; the different means by which sharing personal accounts was encouraged and used to assess peer readiness; and the methods used to instil (and assess) boundaries in the stories the peers shared. In neonatal-related peer support provision, the expected use of peer supporters' stories resonates with the 'use of self' canon in social work practice. Peer supporters were expected to modify personal stories to ensure that service-user (parents) needs were primary, the information was beneficial, and harm was minimised. Further work to build resilience and emotional intelligence in peer supporters is needed."
32729045,Multiparametric MRI and Whole Slide Image-Based Pretreatment Prediction of Pathological Response to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Rectal Cancer: A Multicenter Radiopathomic Study,Lizhi Shao,"Background: The aim of this work is to combine radiological and pathological information of tumor to develop a signature for pretreatment prediction of discrepancies of pathological response at several centers and restage patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) for individualized treatment planning. Patients and methods: A total of 981 consecutive patients with evaluation of response according to tumor regression grade (TRG) who received nCRT were retrospectively recruited from four hospitals (primary cohort and external validation cohort 1-3); both pretreatment multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) and whole slide image (WSI) of biopsy specimens were available for each patient. Quantitative image features were extracted from mp-MRI and WSI and used to construct a radiopathomics signature (RPS) powered by an artificial-intelligence model. Models based on mp-MRI or WSI alone were also constructed for comparison. Results: The RPS showed overall accuracy of 79.66-87.66% in validation cohorts. The areas under the curve of RPS at specific response grades were 0.98 (TRG0), 0.93 (≤ TRG1), and 0.84 (≤ TRG2). RPS at each grade of pathological response revealed significant improvement compared with both signatures constructed without combining multiscale tumor information (P < 0.01). Moreover, RPS showed relevance to distinct probabilities of overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with LARC who underwent nCRT (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that radiopathomics, combining both radiological information of the whole tumor and pathological information of local lesions from biopsy, could potentially predict discrepancies of pathological response prior to nCRT for better treatment planning."
32728913,Body mass index in young adulthood and risk of subsequent dementia at different levels of intelligence and education in Danish men,Merete Osler,"The risk of dementia seems to be established already early in life, which leads to the question if overweight early in life is an important risk factor for dementia as it appears to be later in life. We examined the association between body mass index (BMI) at entry to adult life and subsequent risk of dementia in men and assessed whether the relationship differed by levels of intelligence and education. The study population consisted of 377,598 Danish men born 1939-1959 with measures of height, weight, intelligence test score (ITS), and educational level (EL) at conscript board examinations around the age of 19 years. Dementia outcomes were obtained from National Patient and Prescription Registries between 1969 and 2016. The association between BMI and dementia was analysed using Cox proportional hazard regression including interactions between BMI and ITS and EL, respectively. During the follow-up through age 77 years, 6144 (1.6%) developed dementia. The frequency was highest in men with lowest BMI, lowest ITS and lowest EL. Young adult BMI below the mean of 21.8 kg/m2 was inversely associated with subsequent dementia, whereas there was no association with higher levels of BMI. Adjustment for young adult ITS and EL attenuated the risk estimates slightly, and interaction analyses showed that the shape of the association between BMI and dementia was unaffected by the levels of ITS and EL. Regardless of levels of ITS and EL, young adult BMI below the mean is inversely associated with subsequent dementia, whereas there is no association with higher levels of BMI."
32728877,Artificial intelligence in radiotherapy: a technological review,Ke Sheng,"Radiation therapy (RT) is widely used to treat cancer. Technological advances in RT have occurred in the past 30 years. These advances, such as three-dimensional image guidance, intensity modulation, and robotics, created challenges and opportunities for the next breakthrough, in which artificial intelligence (AI) will possibly play important roles. AI will replace certain repetitive and labor-intensive tasks and improve the accuracy and consistency of others, particularly those with increased complexity because of technological advances. The improvement in efficiency and consistency is important to manage the increasing cancer patient burden to the society. Furthermore, AI may provide new functionalities that facilitate satisfactory RT. The functionalities include superior images for real-time intervention and adaptive and personalized RT. AI may effectively synthesize and analyze big data for such purposes. This review describes the RT workflow and identifies areas, including imaging, treatment planning, quality assurance, and outcome prediction, that benefit from AI. This review primarily focuses on deep-learning techniques, although conventional machine-learning techniques are also mentioned."
32728850,Cognitive and academic benefits of music training with children: A multilevel meta-analysis,Giovanni Sala,"Music training has repeatedly been claimed to positively impact children's cognitive skills and academic achievement (literacy and mathematics). This claim relies on the assumption that engaging in intellectually demanding activities fosters particular domain-general cognitive skills, or even general intelligence. The present meta-analytic review (N = 6,984, k = 254, m = 54) shows that this belief is incorrect. Once the quality of study design is controlled for, the overall effect of music training programs is null ([Formula: see text] ≈ 0) and highly consistent across studies (τ2 ≈ 0). Results of Bayesian analyses employing distributional assumptions (informative priors) derived from previous research in cognitive training corroborate these conclusions. Small statistically significant overall effects are obtained only in those studies implementing no random allocation of participants and employing non-active controls ([Formula: see text] ≈ 0.200, p < .001). Interestingly, music training is ineffective regardless of the type of outcome measure (e.g., verbal, non-verbal, speed-related, etc.), participants' age, and duration of training. Furthermore, we note that, beyond meta-analysis of experimental studies, a considerable amount of cross-sectional evidence indicates that engagement in music has no impact on people's non-music cognitive skills or academic achievement. We conclude that researchers' optimism about the benefits of music training is empirically unjustified and stems from misinterpretation of the empirical data and, possibly, confirmation bias."
32728829,The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Echocardiography,Karthik Seetharam,"Purpose of review: Echocardiography is an indispensable tool in diagnostic cardiology and is fundamental to clinical care. Significant advances in cardiovascular imaging technology paralleled by rapid growth in electronic medical records, miniaturized devices, real-time monitoring, and wearable devices using body sensor network technology have led to the development of complex data. Recent findings: The intricate nature of these data can be overwhelming and exceed the capabilities of current statistical software. Machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence (AI), can help health care providers navigate through this complex labyrinth of information and unravel hidden discoveries. Furthermore, ML algorithms can help automate several tasks in echocardiography and clinical care. ML can serve as a valuable diagnostic tool for physicians in the field of echocardiography. In addition, it can help expand the capabilities of research and discover alternative pathways in medical management. In this review article, we describe the role of AI and ML in echocardiography."
32728518,Smart diagnostics devices through artificial intelligence and mechanobiological approaches,Dinesh Yadav,"The present work illustrates the promising intervention of smart diagnostics devices through artificial intelligence (AI) and mechanobiological approaches in health care practices. The artificial intelligence and mechanobiological approaches in diagnostics widen the scope for point of care techniques for the timely revealing of diseases by understanding the biomechanical properties of the tissue of interest. Smart diagnostic device senses the physical parameters due to change in mechanical, biological, and luidic properties of the cells and to control these changes, supply the necessary drugs immediately using AI techniques. The latest techniques like sweat diagnostics to measure the overall health, Photoplethysmography (PPG) for real-time monitoring of pulse waveform by capturing the reflected signal due to blood pulsation), Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and Nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS) smart devices to detect disease at its early stage, lab-on-chip and organ-on-chip technologies, Ambulatory Circadian Monitoring device (ACM), a wrist-worn device for Parkinson's disease have been discussed. The recent and futuristic smart diagnostics tool/techniques like emotion recognition by applying machine learning algorithms, atomic force microscopy that measures the fibrinogen and erythrocytes binding force, smartphone-based retinal image analyser system, image-based computational modeling for various neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, tuberculosis, predicting and preventing of Zika virus, optimal drugs and doses for HIV using AI, etc. have been reviewed. The objective of this review is to examine smart diagnostics devices based on artificial intelligence and mechanobiological approaches, with their medical applications in healthcare. This review determines that smart diagnostics devices have potential applications in healthcare, but more research work will be essential for prospective accomplishments of this technology."
32728378,Automatic breast ultrasound: state of the art and future perspectives,Luca Nicosia,"The three-dimensional automated breast ultrasound system (3D ABUS) is a new device which represents a huge innovation in the breast ultrasound field, with several application scenarios of great interest. ABUS's aim is to solve some of the main defects of traditional ultrasound, such as lack of standardization, high level of skill non-reproducibility, small field of view and high commitment of physician time. ABUS has proven to be an excellent non-ionising alternative to other supplemental screening options for women with dense breast tissue; also, it has appeared to be very promising in daily clinical practice. The purpose of this paper is to present a summary of current applications of ABUS, focusing on clinical applications and future perspectives as ABUS is particularly promising for studies involving artificial intelligence, radiomics and evaluation of breast molecular subtypes."

32727807,Artificial Intelligence in Ovarian Cancer Diagnosis,Munetoshi Akazawa,"Background/aim: This study aimed to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the pathological diagnosis of ovarian tumors using patient information and data from preoperative examinations. Patients and methods: A total of 202 patients with ovarian tumors were enrolled, including 53 with ovarian cancer, 23 with borderline malignant tumors, and 126 with benign ovarian tumors. Using 5 machine learning classifiers, including support vector machine, random forest, naive Bayes, logistic regression, and XGBoost, we derived diagnostic results from 16 features, commonly available from blood tests, patient background, and imaging tests. We also analyzed the importance of 16 features on the prediction of disease. Results: The highest accuracy was 0.80 in the machine learning algorithm of XGBoost. The evaluation of importance of the features showed different results among the correlation coefficient of the features, the regression coefficient, and the features importance of random forest. Conclusion: AI could play a role in the prediction of pathological diagnosis of ovarian cancer from preoperative examinations."
32727587,Small molecules block the interaction between porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and CD163 receptor and the infection of pig cells,Chang Huang,"Background: Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically devastating diseases affecting the pork industry globally. PRRS is caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV). Currently there are no effective treatments against this swine disease. Methods: Through artificial intelligence molecular screening, we obtained a set of small molecule compounds predicted to target the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain 5 (SRCR5) of CD163, which is a cell surface receptor specific for PRRSV infection. These compounds were screened using a cell-based bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, and the function of positive hit was further evaluated and validated by PRRSV-infection assay using porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Results: Using the BiFC assay, we identified one compound with previously unverified function, 4-Fluoro-2-methyl-N-[3-(3-morpholin-4-ylsulfonylanilino)quinoxalin-2-yl]benzenesulfonamide (designated here as B7), that significantly inhibits the interaction between the PRRSV glycoprotein (GP2a or GP4) and the CD163-SRCR5 domain. We further demonstrated that compound B7 inhibits PRRSV infection of PAMs, the primary target of PRRSV in a dose-dependent manner. B7 significantly inhibited the infection caused by both type I and type II PRRSV strains. Further comparison and functional evaluation of chemical compounds structurally related to B7 revealed that the 3-(morpholinosulfonyl)aniline moiety of B7 or the 3-(piperidinylsulfonyl)aniline moiety in a B7 analogue is important for the inhibitory function against PRRSV infection. Conclusions: Our study identified a novel strategy to potentially prevent PRRSV infection in pigs by blocking the PRRSV-CD163 interaction with small molecules."
32727557,Subjective working memory predicts objective memory in cognitively normal aging: a HUNT study,Ole Bosnes,"Background: Recent studies have shown that subjective memory is multi-, rather than uni-dimensional, in line with the results of objective memory tests. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there is an association between aspects of memory measured by the subjective Meta-Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) and aspects of memory measured by the objective Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III) tests in cognitively normal older adults. Method: The study subjects (n = 106) were cognitively normal, were aged 57-89 years and had participated in the third wave of the North-Trøndelag Health survey (HUNT3). All subjects had completed the MMQ, the WMS-III and the WAIS-III. Previous results from the MMQ (measured as the total MMQ score; the Component I score, related to long-term explicit declarative memory; and the Component II score, related to working/short-term memory) were compared with objective results from WMS-III (Logical Memory) and WAIS-III (Vocabulary and Letter-Number Sequencing) subtests. We conducted linear regression analyses with each objective memory test result as the dependent variable, and subjective memory measures and demographics as independent variables, as well as analyses of MMQ items vs. objective memory. Results: Subjective working memory impairment (Component II) was significant related to poor performance in objective episodic memory, according to correlation and regression analyses with demographic covariates. In contrast, ratings of impaired subjective declarative memory (Component I) were not related to poor objective memory performance. Conclusions: Specific aspects of subjective memory related differentially to performance in specific objective memory tests. Clinicians and researchers might consider targeting working memory aspects of subjective memory tests, when seeking an estimate of objective memory performance."
32727317,Middle-Level Features for the Explanation of Classification Systems by Sparse Dictionary Methods,A Apicella,"Machine learning (ML) systems are affected by a pervasive lack of transparency. The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) research area addresses this problem and the related issue of explaining the behavior of ML systems in terms that are understandable to human beings. In many explanation of XAI approaches, the output of ML systems are explained in terms of low-level features of their inputs. However, these approaches leave a substantive explanatory burden with human users, insofar as the latter are required to map low-level properties into more salient and readily understandable parts of the input. To alleviate this cognitive burden, an alternative model-agnostic framework is proposed here. This framework is instantiated to address explanation problems in the context of ML image classification systems, without relying on pixel relevance maps and other low-level features of the input. More specifically, one obtains sets of middle-level properties of classification inputs that are perceptually salient by applying sparse dictionary learning techniques. These middle-level properties are used as building blocks for explanations of image classifications. The achieved explanations are parsimonious, for their reliance on a limited set of middle-level image properties. And they can be contrastive, because the set of middle-level image properties can be used to explain why the system advanced the proposed classification over other antagonist classifications. In view of its model-agnostic character, the proposed framework is adaptable to a variety of other ML systems and explanation problems."
32727187,Promoting the colorectal surgery in virtue of new theories and techniques],Z T Zhang,"Since the 21st century, with the development of minimally invasive surgical technology, the update of comprehensive treatment strategies and the progress of clinical research, colorectal surgery has developed rapidly. However, in recent years, some disputable issues still exist in colorectal surgery, such as transanal total mesorectal excision, pelvic cavity lateral lymph node dissection, the ""wait and observe"" strategy for clinical complete remission of rectal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy, and robotic colorectal surgical operation. In addition, the application of three dimensions imaging, 4K resolution, 5th generation wireless systems, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and other new techniques may provide extensive space and new opportunity for the development of colorectal surgery. The therapic outcome could be optimized by more relevant clinical research and evidence, which contribute to the standardization of surgical treatment of colorectal cancer."
35693385,The impact of rapport on intelligence yield: police source handler telephone interactions with covert human intelligence sources,Jordan Nunan,"Covert Human Intelligence Sources (CHIS) provide unique access to criminals and organised crime groups, and their collection of intelligence is vital to understanding England and Wales' threat picture. Rapport is essential to the establishment and maintenance of effective professional relationships between source handlers and their CHIS. Thus, rapport-based interviewing is a fundamental factor to maximising intelligence yield. The present research gained unprecedented access to 105 real-life audio recorded telephone interactions between England and Wales police source handlers and CHIS. This research quantified both the rapport component behaviours (e.g., attention, positivity, and coordination) displayed by the source handler and the intelligence yielded from the CHIS, in order to investigate the frequencies of these rapport components and their relationship to intelligence yield. Overall rapport, attention and coordination significantly correlated with intelligence yield, while positivity did not. Attention was the most frequently used component of rapport, followed by positivity, and then coordination."
32726352,Does mathematics training lead to better logical thinking and reasoning? A cross-sectional assessment from students to professors,Clio Cresswell,"Mathematics is often promoted as endowing those who study it with transferable skills such as an ability to think logically and critically or to have improved investigative skills, resourcefulness and creativity in problem solving. However, there is scant evidence to back up such claims. This project tested participants with increasing levels of mathematics training on 11 well-studied rational and logical reasoning tasks aggregated from various psychological studies. These tasks, that included the Cognitive Reflection Test and the Wason Selection Task, are of particular interest as they have typically and reliably eluded participants in all studies, and results have been uncorrelated with general intelligence, education levels and other demographic information. The results in this study revealed that in general the greater the mathematics training of the participant, the more tasks were completed correctly, and that performance on some tasks was also associated with performance on others not traditionally associated. A ceiling effect also emerged. The work is deconstructed from the viewpoint of adding to the platform from which to approach the greater, and more scientifically elusive, question: are any skills associated with mathematics training innate or do they arise from skills transfer?"
32726047,Study on precise mechanism of Chinese patent medicine from perspective of activating data],Lian-Xin Wang,"Traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) syndrome differentiation and treatment has a characteristic and advantageous efficacy in the prevention and treatment of major diseases(no matter for new or sudden infectious diseases or major chronic diseases). At present, the clinical application by Western medicine disease's name, stage, classification and other indications limits the role of TCM syndrome differentiation and treatment, and makes TCM difficult to play its advantages. Therefore, the therapeutic value and social value attribute of Chinese patent medicine after being launched in the market cannot be effectively demonstrated, or even generalized as adjuvants. Under the circumstances, it is difficult to put forward precise positioning different from chemical drugs, with fewer high-level and high-quality evidence-based evidences for precise positioning. The research on the pathological links and therapeutic mechanism of its effect on diseases is also less systematic. The development of biotechnology, such as genomics, has brought medicine into the era of precision, providing ideas and technical support for the exploration of syndrome biomarkers and the analysis of therapeutic mechanism with them as parameters. Digital China Think Tank Forum once mentioned that the development of sequencing technology provides 100% of human genetic code, while only 3% can understand it. Block data 4.0: activation data in the era of artificial intelligence puts forward the concept of activation data, which can be regarded as a theoretical hypothesis for big data, provides a new cognitive thinking and solution for increasingly prominent data paradox between bioinformation explosion and clinical big data, and is a bridge between cross-border data association and fusion. After deeply mining the dominant and recessive value of clinical data and histological data, we can make the pathogenesis of syndrome differentiation and treatment from dark knowledge to clear knowledge. Therefore, with Chinese patent medicine as the guide, the research on the efficacy and mechanism of precise positioning of traditional Chinese medicine after marketing is carried out, and the precise system of &quot;syndrome, disease, function, pathological link and biological connotation&quot; is constructed, which provides a powerful basis and support for increasing the scientific and technological content of varieties."
32725298,Fully Autonomous AI,Wolfhart Totschnig,"In the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics, the term ""autonomy"" is generally used to mean the capacity of an artificial agent to operate independently of human guidance. It is thereby assumed that the agent has a fixed goal or ""utility function"" with respect to which the appropriateness of its actions will be evaluated. From a philosophical perspective, this notion of autonomy seems oddly weak. For, in philosophy, the term is generally used to refer to a stronger capacity, namely the capacity to ""give oneself the law,"" to decide by oneself what one's goal or principle of action will be. The predominant view in the literature on the long-term prospects and risks of artificial intelligence is that an artificial agent cannot exhibit such autonomy because it cannot rationally change its own final goal, since changing the final goal is counterproductive with respect to that goal and hence undesirable. The aim of this paper is to challenge this view by showing that it is based on questionable assumptions about the nature of goals and values. I argue that a general AI may very well come to modify its final goal in the course of developing its understanding of the world. This has important implications for how we are to assess the long-term prospects and risks of artificial intelligence."
32725079,"Hippocampal formation volume, its subregions, and its specific contributions to visuospatial memory tasks",T Shavitt,"Visuospatial memory (VSM) is the ability to represent and manipulate visual and spatial information. This cognitive function depends on the functioning of the hippocampal formation (HF), located in the medial portion of the temporal cortex. The present study aimed to investigate whether there is an association between the volume of the HF and performance in VSM tests. High-resolution structural images (T1) and neuropsychological tests evaluating VSM were performed on 31 healthy individuals. A VSM index was created by grouping 5 variables from 5 tasks (4 from the CANTAB battery and 1 from the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test). Multiple linear regression models using the volumes of HF subregions as independent variables and the VSM index as the dependent variable were conducted to test the hypothesis that memory performance could be predicted by HF volumes. We also conducted analyses to explore the role of covariates that may mediate this relationship, specifically age and intelligence quotient (IQ). We found significant associations between the hippocampal subregions of the left hemisphere and the VSM index (F(7,22)=2.758, P=0.032, R2a=0.298). When IQ was accounted for as a covariate, we also found significant results for the right hemisphere (F(8,21)=2.804, P=0.028, R2a=0.517). We concluded that the bilateral hippocampal formations contributed to performance on VSM tasks. Also, VSM processing is essential for a diverse set of daily activities and may be influenced by demographic variables in healthy subjects."
32724773,Parental Experiences about the Sexual and Reproductive Health of Adolescent Girls with Intellectual Disability: A Qualitative Study,Shadi Goli,"Background: Intellectually disabled persons, as compared with normal people, experience different changes during the adolescence period including the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics. However, owing to their low intelligence quotient, these changes are usually accompanied by more problems and challenges. The present study was conducted to determine the experiences of parents regarding the sexual and reproductive health of educable intellectually disabled adolescent girls. Materials and methods: This qualitative study was carried out on 52 participants (adolescent girls, parents, teachers, healthcare providers, and managers) who were selected via purposeful sampling in Isfahan between July 2016 and April 2017. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and field notes, and analyzed using conventional content analysis. Results: Five sub-categories were extracted: ""unawareness about sexual needs of the adolescent girl and her potential vulnerability,"" ""inappropriate actions in directing the sexual behaviors of the adolescent,"" ""insufficient supervision and care over the adolescent's sexual health,"" ""inappropriate actions toward marrying off the adolescent,"" and ""inappropriate actions regarding the menstrual and genital health"" which formed the main category of ""parents' inefficiency in maintaining adolescent girls' sexual and reproductive health."" Conclusions: Based on the results, parents face different challenges about the sexual and reproductive health of intellectually disabled adolescent girls. Hence, empowering the parents especially mothers through teachers and healthcare providers with the knowledge and skills to maintain the sexual and reproductive health of intellectually disabled adolescent girls would make them emboldened to find the ability to protect themselves in different situations."
32724610,"Developmental assessments during the first 5 years of life in infants fed breast milk, cow's milk formula, or soy formula",Jayne Bellando,"Objective: To investigate the effects of infant feeding mode on childhood cognition and language as the differential effects of infant feeding on development remain understudied. Methods: Breastfed [BF, 174], cow's milk-based formula-fed [MF, 169], or soy protein-based formula-fed [SF, 161] children were longitudinally tested from age 3 to 60 months for neurodevelopment. Data were analyzed using mixed models while adjusting for multiple covariates. Sex differences were also assessed. Results: Standard scores were within established norms for all groups. There were no differences in mental development to age 24 months, yet BF children had significantly higher motor development scores at age 3 months than SF children (99.1 versus. 97.2). BF children had significantly higher composite intelligence scores at 48 months than MF and SF children (113.4 versus. 109.6 and 108.4, respectively) and higher verbal intelligence scores than SF children at 48 (105.6 versus. 100.7) and 60 months (109.8 versus. 105.9). Greater total language scores at ages 36 and 48 months were found in BF children compared with children fed MF or SF (p < .001), with differences between sexes for auditory comprehension. Higher total language scores at age 60 months were found between BF and SF (105.0 versus. 100.1). Conclusion: Breastfeeding was associated with small, statistically significant, differences between children ages 3 and 5 years in verbal intelligence, expressive communication, and auditory comprehension with the latter having potential sexual dimorphic effects. Yet, these differences remain small and may not be of clinical relevance. Overall, MF and SF did not significantly differ."
32724304,Design and Development of Diabetes Management System Using Machine Learning,Robert A Sowah,"This paper describes the design and implementation of a software system to improve the management of diabetes using a machine learning approach and to demonstrate and evaluate its effectiveness in controlling diabetes. The proposed approach for this management system handles the various factors that affect the health of people with diabetes by combining multiple artificial intelligence algorithms. The proposed framework factors the diabetes management problem into subgoals: building a Tensorflow neural network model for food classification; thus, it allows users to upload an image to determine if a meal is recommended for consumption; implementing K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm to recommend meals; using cognitive sciences to build a diabetes question and answer chatbot; tracking user activity, user geolocation, and generating pdfs of logged blood sugar readings. The food recognition model was evaluated with cross-entropy metrics that support validation using Neural networks with a backpropagation algorithm. The model learned features of the images fed from local Ghanaian dishes with specific nutritional value and essence in managing diabetics and provided accurate image classification with given labels and corresponding accuracy. The model achieved specified goals by predicting with high accuracy, labels of new images. The food recognition and classification model achieved over 95% accuracy levels for specific calorie intakes. The performance of the meal recommender model and question and answer chatbot was tested with a designed cross-platform user-friendly interface using Cordova and Ionic Frameworks for software development for both mobile and web applications. The system recommended meals to meet the calorific needs of users successfully using KNN (with k = 5) and answered questions asked in a human-like way. The implemented system would solve the problem of managing activity, dieting recommendations, and medication notification of diabetics."
32723855,OpenClinical.net: Artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering at the point of care,John Fox,"Objective: OpenClinical.net is a way of disseminating clinical guidelines to improve quality of care whose distinctive feature is to combine the benefits of clinical guidelines and other human-readable material with the power of artificial intelligence to give patient-specific recommendations. A key objective is to empower healthcare professionals to author, share, critique, trial and revise these 'executable' models of best practice. Design: OpenClinical.net Alpha (www.openclinical.net) is an operational publishing platform that uses a class of artificial intelligence techniques called knowledge engineering to capture human expertise in decision-making, care planning and other cognitive skills in an intuitive but formal language called PROforma.3 PROforma models can be executed by a computer to yield patient-specific recommendations, explain the reasons and provide supporting evidence on demand. Results: PROforma has been validated in a wide range of applications in diverse clinical settings and specialties, with trials published in high impact peer-reviewed journals. Trials have included patient workup and risk assessment; decision support (eg, diagnosis, test and treatment selection, prescribing); adaptive care pathways and care planning. The OpenClinical software platform presently supports authoring, testing, sharing and maintenance. OpenClinical's open-access, open-source repository Repertoire currently carries approximately 50+ diverse examples (https://openclinical.net/index.php?id=69). Conclusion: OpenClinical.net is a showcase for a PROforma-based approach to improving care quality, safety, efficiency and better patient experience in many kinds of routine clinical practice. This human-centred approach to artificial intelligence will help to ensure that it is developed and used responsibly and in ways that are consistent with professional priorities and public expectations."
32723713,Artificial Intelligence in Health Care: Bibliometric Analysis,Yuqi Guo,"Background: As a critical driving power to promote health care, the health care-related artificial intelligence (AI) literature is growing rapidly. Objective: The purpose of this analysis is to provide a dynamic and longitudinal bibliometric analysis of health care-related AI publications. Methods: The Web of Science (Clarivate PLC) was searched to retrieve all existing and highly cited AI-related health care research papers published in English up to December 2019. Based on bibliometric indicators, a search strategy was developed to screen the title for eligibility, using the abstract and full text where needed. The growth rate of publications, characteristics of research activities, publication patterns, and research hotspot tendencies were computed using the HistCite software. Results: The search identified 5235 hits, of which 1473 publications were included in the analyses. Publication output increased an average of 17.02% per year since 1995, but the growth rate of research papers significantly increased to 45.15% from 2014 to 2019. The major health problems studied in AI research are cancer, depression, Alzheimer disease, heart failure, and diabetes. Artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and convolutional neural networks have the highest impact on health care. Nucleosides, convolutional neural networks, and tumor markers have remained research hotspots through 2019. Conclusions: This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the AI-related research conducted in the field of health care, which helps researchers, policy makers, and practitioners better understand the development of health care-related AI research and possible practice implications. Future AI research should be dedicated to filling in the gaps between AI health care research and clinical applications."
32723711,Artificial Intelligence-Powered Digital Health Platform and Wearable Devices Improve Outcomes for Older Adults in Assisted Living Communities: Pilot Intervention Study,Gerald Wilmink,"Background: Wearables and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital health platforms that utilize machine learning algorithms can autonomously measure a senior's change in activity and behavior and may be useful tools for proactive interventions that target modifiable risk factors. Objective: The goal of this study was to analyze how a wearable device and AI-powered digital health platform could provide improved health outcomes for older adults in assisted living communities. Methods: Data from 490 residents from six assisted living communities were analyzed retrospectively over 24 months. The intervention group (+CP) consisted of 3 communities that utilized CarePredict (n=256), and the control group (-CP) consisted of 3 communities (n=234) that did not utilize CarePredict. The following outcomes were measured and compared to baseline: hospitalization rate, fall rate, length of stay (LOS), and staff response time. Results: The residents of the +CP and -CP communities exhibit no statistical difference in age (P=.64), sex (P=.63), and staff service hours per resident (P=.94). The data show that the +CP communities exhibited a 39% lower hospitalization rate (P=.02), a 69% lower fall rate (P=.01), and a 67% greater length of stay (P=.03) than the -CP communities. The staff alert acknowledgment and reach resident times also improved in the +CP communities by 37% (P=.02) and 40% (P=.02), respectively. Conclusions: The AI-powered digital health platform provides the community staff with actionable information regarding each resident's activities and behavior, which can be used to identify older adults that are at an increased risk for a health decline. Staff can use this data to intervene much earlier, protecting seniors from conditions that left untreated could result in hospitalization. In summary, the use of wearables and AI-powered digital health platform can contribute to improved health outcomes for seniors in assisted living communities. The accuracy of the system will be further validated in a larger trial."
32722783,A refined cell-of-origin classifier with targeted NGS and artificial intelligence shows robust predictive value in DLBCL,Zijun Y Xu-Monette,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous entity of B-cell lymphoma. Cell-of-origin (COO) classification of DLBCL is required in routine practice by the World Health Organization classification for biological and therapeutic insights. Genetic subtypes uncovered recently are based on distinct genetic alterations in DLBCL, which are different from the COO subtypes defined by gene expression signatures of normal B cells retained in DLBCL. We hypothesize that classifiers incorporating both genome-wide gene-expression and pathogenetic variables can improve the therapeutic significance of DLBCL classification. To develop such refined classifiers, we performed targeted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with a commercially available next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform in a large cohort of 418 DLBCLs. Genetic and transcriptional data obtained by RNA-Seq in a single run were explored by state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a NGS-COO classifier for COO assignment and NGS survival models for clinical outcome prediction. The NGS-COO model built through applying AI in the training set was robust, showing high concordance with COO classification by either Affymetrix GeneChip microarray or the NanoString Lymph2Cx assay in 2 validation sets. Although the NGS-COO model was not trained for clinical outcome, the activated B-cell-like compared with the germinal-center B-cell-like subtype had significantly poorer survival. The NGS survival models stratified 30% high-risk patients in the validation set with poor survival as in the training set. These results demonstrate that targeted RNA-Seq coupled with AI deep learning techniques provides reproducible, efficient, and affordable assays for clinical application. The clinical grade assays and NGS models integrating both genetic and transcriptional factors developed in this study may eventually support precision medicine in DLBCL."
32722697,Deep transfer learning artificial intelligence accurately stages COVID-19 lung disease severity on portable chest radiographs,Jocelyn Zhu,"This study employed deep-learning convolutional neural networks to stage lung disease severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection on portable chest x-ray (CXR) with radiologist score of disease severity as ground truth. This study consisted of 131 portable CXR from 84 COVID-19 patients (51M 55.1±14.9yo; 29F 60.1±14.3yo; 4 missing information). Three expert chest radiologists scored the left and right lung separately based on the degree of opacity (0-3) and geographic extent (0-4). Deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to predict lung disease severity scores. Data were split into 80% training and 20% testing datasets. Correlation analysis between AI-predicted versus radiologist scores were analyzed. Comparison was made with traditional and transfer learning. The average opacity score was 2.52 (range: 0-6) with a standard deviation of 0.25 (9.9%) across three readers. The average geographic extent score was 3.42 (range: 0-8) with a standard deviation of 0.57 (16.7%) across three readers. The inter-rater agreement yielded a Fleiss' Kappa of 0.45 for opacity score and 0.71 for extent score. AI-predicted scores strongly correlated with radiologist scores, with the top model yielding a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.90 (range: 0.73-0.90 for traditional learning and 0.83-0.90 for transfer learning) and a mean absolute error of 8.5% (ranges: 17.2-21.0% and 8.5%-15.5, respectively). Transfer learning generally performed better. In conclusion, deep-learning CNN accurately stages disease severity on portable chest x-ray of COVID-19 lung infection. This approach may prove useful to stage lung disease severity, prognosticate, and predict treatment response and survival, thereby informing risk management and resource allocation."
32722657,A Frequency Pattern Mining Model Based on Deep Neural Network for Real-Time Classification of Heart Conditions,Hyun Yoo,"Recently, a massive amount of big data of bioinformation is collected by sensor-based IoT devices. The collected data are also classified into different types of health big data in various techniques. A personalized analysis technique is a basis for judging the risk factors of personal cardiovascular disorders in real-time. The objective of this paper is to provide the model for the personalized heart condition classification in combination with the fast and effective preprocessing technique and deep neural network in order to process the real-time accumulated biosensor input data. The model can be useful to learn input data and develop an approximation function, and it can help users recognize risk situations. For the analysis of the pulse frequency, a fast Fourier transform is applied in preprocessing work. With the use of the frequency-by-frequency ratio data of the extracted power spectrum, data reduction is performed. To analyze the meanings of preprocessed data, a neural network algorithm is applied. In particular, a deep neural network is used to analyze and evaluate linear data. A deep neural network can make multiple layers and can establish an operation model of nodes with the use of gradient descent. The completed model was trained by classifying the ECG signals collected in advance into normal, control, and noise groups. Thereafter, the ECG signal input in real time through the trained deep neural network system was classified into normal, control, and noise. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, this study utilized a ratio of data operation cost reduction and F-measure. As a result, with the use of fast Fourier transform and cumulative frequency percentage, the size of ECG reduced to 1:32. According to the analysis on the F-measure of the deep neural network, the model had 83.83% accuracy. Given the results, the modified deep neural network technique can reduce the size of big data in terms of computing work, and it is an effective system to reduce operation time."
32722557,In Pursuit of Work Performance: Testing the Contribution of Emotional Intelligence and Burnout,Martin Sanchez-Gomez,"Previous research has highlighted the connection between emotional intelligence (EI) and work performance. However, the role of job burnout in this context remains relatively unexplored. This study aimed to examine the mediator role of burnout in the relationship between EI and work performance in a multioccupational sample of 1197 Spanish professionals (58.6% women). The participants completed the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, the Maslach Burnout Inventory, and the Individual Work Performance Questionnaire. As expected, the results demonstrated a positive relationship between EI and performance, and a negative relationship with burnout, which has a mediator effect in the relationship between EI and work performance. Professionals with high levels of IE and low burnout reported the highest performance. Multiple mediation analyses showed that employees' EI was indirectly connected to work performance via professional efficacy and exhaustion, even when controlling the effects of sociodemographic variables. The same pattern was found when multiple mediations were conducted for each EI dimension. These findings demonstrate the importance of burnout in understanding work performance and emphasize the role of EI as a protective variable which can prevent the development or chronic progression of workers' burnout."
32722290,A Pilot Study of Multi-Input Recurrent Neural Networks for Drug-Kinase Binding Prediction,Kristy Carpenter,"The use of virtual drug screening can be beneficial to research teams, enabling them to narrow down potentially useful compounds for further study. A variety of virtual screening methods have been developed, typically with machine learning classifiers at the center of their design. In the present study, we created a virtual screener for protein kinase inhibitors. Experimental compound-target interaction data were obtained from the IDG-DREAM Drug-Kinase Binding Prediction Challenge. These data were converted and fed as inputs into two multi-input recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The first network utilized data encoded in one-hot representation, while the other incorporated embedding layers. The models were developed in Python, and were designed to output the IC50 of the target compounds. The performance of the models was assessed primarily through analysis of the Q2 values produced from runs of differing sample and epoch size; recorded loss values were also reported and graphed. The performance of the models was limited, though multiple changes are proposed for potential improvement of a multi-input recurrent neural network-based screening tool."
32722280,"Machine Learning Confirms Nonlinear Relationship between Severity of Peripheral Arterial Disease, Functional Limitation and Symptom Severity",Zulfiqar Qutrio Baloch,"Background: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) involves arterial blockages in the body, except those serving the heart and brain. We explore the relationship of functional limitation and PAD symptoms obtained from a quality-of-life questionnaire about the severity of the disease. We used a supervised artificial intelligence-based method of data analyses known as machine learning (ML) to demonstrate a nonlinear relationship between symptoms and functional limitation amongst patients with and without PAD. Objectives: This paper will demonstrate the use of machine learning to explore the relationship between functional limitation and symptom severity to PAD severity. Methods: We performed supervised machine learning and graphical analysis, analyzing 703 patients from an administrative database with data comprising the toe-brachial index (TBI), baseline demographics and symptom score(s) derived from a modified vascular quality-of-life questionnaire, calf circumference in centimeters and a six-minute walk (distance in meters). Results: Graphical analysis upon categorizing patients into critical limb ischemia (CLI), severe PAD, moderate PAD and no PAD demonstrated a decrease in walking distance as symptoms worsened and the relationship appeared nonlinear. A supervised ML ensemble (random forest, neural network, generalized linear model) found symptom score, calf circumference (cm), age in years, and six-minute walk (distance in meters) to be important variables to predict PAD. Graphical analysis of a six-minute walk distance against each of the other variables categorized by PAD status showed nonlinear relationships. For low symptom scores, a six-minute walk test (6MWT) demonstrated high specificity for PAD. Conclusions: PAD patients with the greatest functional limitation may sometimes be asymptomatic. Patients without PAD show no relationship between functional limitation and symptoms. Machine learning allows exploration of nonlinear relationships. A simple linear model alone would have overlooked or considered such a nonlinear relationship unimportant."

32722198,Fluidized Bed Jet Milling Process Optimized for Mass and Particle Size with a Fuzzy Logic Approach,Jaroslaw Krzywanski,"The milling process is a complex phenomenon dependent on various technological and material parameters. The development of a fluidized bed jet milling model is of high practical significance, since milling is utilized in many industries, and its complexity is still not sufficiently recognized. Therefore, this research aims to optimize fluidized bed jet milling with the use of fuzzy logic (FL) based approach as one of the primary artificial intelligence (AI) methods. The developed fuzzy logic model (FLMill) of the investigated process allows it to be described as a non-iterative procedure, over a wide range of operating conditions. Working air pressure, rotational speed of the classifier rotor, and time of conducting the test are considered as inputs, while mass and mean Sauter diameter of the product are defined as outputs. Several triangular and constant linguistic terms are used in the developed FLMill model, which was validated against the experimental data. The optimum working air pressure and the test's conducting time are 500 kPa and 3000 s, respectively. The optimum rotational speed of the classifier is equal to 50 s-1, considering the mass of the grinding product, and 250 s-1 for the mean Sauter diameter of the product. Such operating parameters allow obtaining 243.3 g of grinding product with the mean Sauter diameter of 11 µm. The research proved that the use of fuzzy logic modeling as a computer-based technique of solving mechanical engineering problems allows effective optimization of the fluidized bed jet milling process."
32722154,"Review of Big Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence and Nature-Inspired Computing Models towards Accurate Detection of COVID-19 Pandemic Cases and Contact Tracing",Israel Edem Agbehadji,"The emergence of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) which was declared a pandemic has spread to 210 countries worldwide. It has had a significant impact on health systems and economic, educational and social facets of contemporary society. As the rate of transmission increases, various collaborative approaches among stakeholders to develop innovative means of screening, detecting and diagnosing COVID-19's cases among human beings at a commensurate rate have evolved. Further, the utility of computing models associated with the fourth industrial revolution technologies in achieving the desired feat has been highlighted. However, there is a gap in terms of the accuracy of detection and prediction of COVID-19 cases and tracing contacts of infected persons. This paper presents a review of computing models that can be adopted to enhance the performance of detecting and predicting the COVID-19 pandemic cases. We focus on big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and nature-inspired computing (NIC) models that can be adopted in the current pandemic. The review suggested that artificial intelligence models have been used for the case detection of COVID-19. Similarly, big data platforms have also been applied for tracing contacts. However, the nature-inspired computing (NIC) models that have demonstrated good performance in feature selection of medical issues are yet to be explored for case detection and tracing of contacts in the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study holds salient implications for practitioners and researchers alike as it elucidates the potentials of NIC in the accurate detection of pandemic cases and optimized contact tracing."
32721953,Morphogo: An Automatic Bone Marrow Cell Classification System on Digital Images Analyzed by Artificial Intelligence,Xinyan Fu,"Introduction: The nucleated-cell differential count on the bone marrow aspirate smears is required for the clinical diagnosis of hematological malignancy. Manual bone marrow differential count is time consuming and lacks consistency. In this study, a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based system was developed to perform cell automatic classification of bone marrow cells and determine its potential clinical applications. Materials and methods: Bone marrow aspirate smears were collected from the Xinqiao Hospital of Army Medical University. First, an automated analysis system (Morphogo) scanned and generated whole digital images of bone marrow smears. Then, the nucleated marrow cells in the selected areas of the smears at a magnification of ×1,000 were analyzed by the software utilizing an AI-based platform. The cell classification results were further reviewed and confirmed independently by 2 experienced pathologists. The automatic cell classification performance of the system was evaluated using 3 categories: accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Correlation coefficients and linear regression equations between automatic cell classification by the AI-based system and concurrent manual differential count were calculated. Results: In 230 cases, the classification accuracy was above 85.7% for hematopoietic lineage cells. Averages of sensitivity and specificity of the system were found to be 69.4 and 97.2%, respectively. The differential cell percentage of the automated count based on 200-500 cell counts was correlated with differential cell percentage provided by the pathologists for granulocytes, erythrocytes, and lymphocytes (r ≥ 0.762, p < 0.001). Discussion/conclusion: This pilot study confirmed that the Morphogo system is a reliable tool for automatic bone marrow cell differential count analysis and has potential for clinical applications. Current ongoing large-scale multicenter validation studies will provide more information to further confirm the clinical utility of the system."
32721853,CAB U-Net: An end-to-end category attention boosting algorithm for segmentation,Xiaofeng Ding,"With the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence, many convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based segmentation methods have been proposed for 3D cardiac segmentation. In this paper, we propose the category attention boosting (CAB) module, which combines the deep network calculation graph with the boosting method. On the one hand, we add the attention mechanism into the gradient boosting process, which enhances the information of coarse segmentation without high computation cost. On the other hand, we introduce the CAB module into the 3D U-Net segmentation network and construct a new multi-scale boosting model CAB U-Net which strengthens the gradient flow in the network and makes full use of the low resolution feature information. Thanks to the advantage that end-to-end networks can adaptively adjust the internal parameters, CAB U-Net can make full use of the complementary effects among different base learners. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our approach can achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods."
32721810,Determining the probability of juvenile delinquency by using support vector machines and designing a clinical decision support system,Ilknur Ucuz,"It is a known fact that individuals who engaged in delinquent behavior in childhood are more probable to carry on similar behavior in adulthood. If the factors that lead children to involve in delinquency are defined, the risk of dragging children into crime can be detected before they are involved in crime and delinquency can be prevented with appropriate preventive rehabilitation programs, in the early period. However, given that delinquent behavior occurs under the influence of multiple conditions and factors rather than a single risk factor; the need for diagnostic tools to evaluate multiple factors together is obvious. Artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support systems have already been used in the field of psychiatry as well as many other fields of medicine. In this study, we assume that thanks to artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support systems, children and adolescents at risk can be detected before the criminal behavior occurs by addressing certain factors. In this way, we anticipate that it can provide psychiatrists and other experts in the field."
32721409,Three-Dimensional Neural Network to Automatically Assess Liver Tumor Burden Change on Consecutive Liver MRIs,Alexander Goehler,"Background: Tumor response to therapy is often assessed by measuring change in liver lesion size between consecutive MRIs. However, these evaluations are both tedious and time-consuming for clinical radiologists. Purpose: In this study, we sought to develop a convolutional neural network to detect liver metastases on MRI and applied this algorithm to assess change in tumor size on consecutive examinations. Methods: We annotated a data set of 64 patients with neuroendocrine tumors who underwent at least two consecutive liver MRIs with gadoxetic acid. We then developed a 3-D neural network using a U-Net architecture with ResNet-18 building blocks that first detected the liver and then lesions within the liver. Liver lesion labels for each examination were then matched in 3-D space using an iterative closest point algorithm followed by Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. Results: We developed a deep learning algorithm that detected liver metastases, co-registered the detected lesions, and then assessed the interval change in tumor burden between two multiparametric liver MRI examinations. Our deep learning algorithm was concordant in 91% with the radiologists' manual assessment about the interval change of disease burden. It had a sensitivity of 0.85 (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.77; 0.93) and specificity of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.87; 0.96) to classify liver segments as diseased or healthy. The mean DICE coefficient for individual lesions ranged between 0.73 and 0.81. Conclusions: Our algorithm displayed high agreement with human readers for detecting change in liver lesions on MRI, offering evidence that artificial intelligence-based detectors may perform these tasks as part of routine clinical care in the future."
32720903,Development and Evaluation of a Smart Contract-Enabled Blockchain System for Home Care Service Innovation: Mixed Methods Study,Shuchih Ernest Chang,"Background: In the home care industry, the assignment and tracking of care services are controlled by care centers that are centralized in nature and prone to inefficient information transmission. A lack of trust among the involved parties, information opaqueness, and large manual manipulation result in lower process efficiency. Objective: This study aimed to explore and demonstrate the application of blockchain and smart contract technologies to innovate/renovate home care services for harvesting the desired blockchain benefits of process transparency, traceability, and interoperability. Methods: An object-oriented analysis/design combined with a unified modeling language tool was used to construct the architecture of the proposed home care service system. System feasibility was evaluated via an implementation test, and a questionnaire survey was performed to collect opinions from home care service respondents knowledgeable about blockchain and smart contracts. Results: According to the comparative analysis results, the proposed design outperformed the existing system in terms of traceability, system efficiency, and process automation. Moreover, for the questionnaire survey, the quantitative analysis results showed that the proposed blockchain-based system had significantly (P<.001) higher mean scores (when compared with the existing system) in terms of important factors, including timeliness, workflow efficiency, automatic notifications, insurance functionality, and auditable traceability. In summary, blockchain-based home care service participants will be able to enjoy improved efficiency, better transparency, and higher levels of process automation. Conclusions: Blockchain and smart contracts can provide valuable benefits to the home care service industry via distributed data management and process automation. The proposed system enhances user experiences by mitigating human intervention and improving service interoperability, transparency/traceability, and real-time response to home care service events. Efforts in exploring and integrating blockchain-based home care services with emerging technologies, such as the internet of things and artificial intelligence, are expected to provide further benefits and therefore are subject to future research."
32720866,Range of Radiologist Performance in a Population-based Screening Cohort of 1 Million Digital Mammography Examinations,Mattie Salim,"Background There is great interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for use in screening mammography. Comparative performance benchmarks from true screening cohorts are needed. Purpose To determine the range of human first-reader performance measures within a population-based screening cohort of 1 million screening mammograms to gauge the performance of emerging AI CAD systems. Materials and Methods This retrospective study consisted of all screening mammograms in women aged 40-74 years in Stockholm County, Sweden, who underwent screening with full-field digital mammography between 2008 and 2015. There were 110 interpreting radiologists, of whom 24 were defined as high-volume readers (ie, those who interpreted more than 5000 annual screening mammograms). A true-positive finding was defined as the presence of a pathology-confirmed cancer within 12 months. Performance benchmarks included sensitivity and specificity, examined per quartile of radiologists' performance. First-reader sensitivity was determined for each tumor subgroup, overall and by quartile of high-volume reader sensitivity. Screening outcomes were examined based on the first reader's sensitivity quartile with 10 000 screening mammograms per quartile. Linear regression models were fitted to test for a linear trend across quartiles of performance. Results A total of 418 041 women (mean age, 54 years ± 10 [standard deviation]) were included, and 1 186 045 digital mammograms were evaluated, with 972 899 assessed by high-volume readers. Overall sensitivity was 73% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 69%, 77%), and overall specificity was 96% (95% CI: 95%, 97%). The mean values per quartile of high-volume reader performance ranged from 63% to 84% for sensitivity and from 95% to 98% for specificity. The sensitivity difference was very large for basal cancers, with the least sensitive and most sensitive high-volume readers detecting 53% and 89% of cancers, respectively (P < .001). Conclusion Benchmarks showed a wide range of performance differences between high-volume readers. Sensitivity varied by tumor characteristics. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article."
32720846,An abbreviated WISC-5 model for identifying youth at risk for intellectual disability in a mixed clinical sample,T Andrew Zabel,"Objective: The correct ""dosing"" of neuropsychological assessment is of interest for the purposes of cost management and the personalization of medicine/assessment. In this context, embedded IQ screening, rather than routine comprehensive IQ testing, may be useful in identifying youth at risk for Intellectual Disability (ID) for whom further assessment is needed. This retrospective, cross-sectional study examined subtests from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition (WISC-5) needed to identify youth with Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) ≤75. Method: Data were obtained from a large pediatric clinically referred sample (N = 4,299; Mean Age = 10.7 years; Range = 6-16y; 66% male; 54% White; 29% receiving Public Insurance), divided into training (n = 2149) and test (n = 2150) samples. Results: In the training sample, sequential and additive regression-based models for predicting FSIQ comprised of one (Block Design [BD]), two (BD + Similarities [SI]), three (BD + SI + Matrix Reasoning [MR]), and four (BD + SI + MR + Digit Span [DS]) subtests of the WISC-5 explained 61.3%, 82.7%, 88.5%, and 93.0% of FSIQ variance, respectively. Using a predicted FSIQ ≤ 80 as a cut score to identify persons with observed FSIQ ≤75, the two subtest (BD + SI) model showed strong sensitivity (83.4), specificity (90.5), and negative predictive value (96.2) in the test sample; however, positive predictive value was low (65.3%). Three and four subtest models provided incremental, but modest gains in classification metrics. Conclusions: Findings suggest the first several subtests of the WISC-5 can be used to identify clinically referred youth at risk for ID who subsequently require full administration of the WISC-5 for consideration of an ID diagnosis."
32720518,Directed jaya algorithm for delivering nano-robots to cancer area,Doaa Ezzat,"In the last few years, it was proposed to deliver drugs using Nano-robots for treating cancer. This paper compares between two recent and efficient algorithms for delivering Nano-robots to cancer area. These algorithms are Jaya algorithm and Directed Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) algorithm. In this paper, we also propose a new hybrid algorithm that combines Jaya and DPSO to speed up the process of Nano-robots delivery. The proposed algorithm is called Directed Jaya (DJaya) algorithm. Experiments have proved that the efficiency of DJaya is higher than both Jaya and DPSO. We show experimentally that DJaya starts delivering Nano-robots earlier than DPSO to facilitate the initiation of the drug release. Also, DJaya finishes delivering Nano-robots earlier than Jaya to complete the drug dose. In addition to this, DJaya groups the Nano-robots together in the target area like DPSO to speed up the drug release process. We finally propose a new strategy for destroying cancer cells efficiently with relatively small number of Nano-robots. This strategy can save 40% of Nano-robots."
32720177,Automated operative phase identification in peroral endoscopic myotomy,Thomas M Ward,"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) have revolutionized image analysis. In surgery, CV applications have focused on surgical phase identification in laparoscopic videos. We proposed to apply CV techniques to identify phases in an endoscopic procedure, peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). Methods: POEM videos were collected from Massachusetts General and Showa University Koto Toyosu Hospitals. Videos were labeled by surgeons with the following ground truth phases: (1) Submucosal injection, (2) Mucosotomy, (3) Submucosal tunnel, (4) Myotomy, and (5) Mucosotomy closure. The deep-learning CV model-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) plus Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-was trained on 30 videos to create POEMNet. We then used POEMNet to identify operative phases in the remaining 20 videos. The model's performance was compared to surgeon annotated ground truth. Results: POEMNet's overall phase identification accuracy was 87.6% (95% CI 87.4-87.9%). When evaluated on a per-phase basis, the model performed well, with mean unweighted and prevalence-weighted F1 scores of 0.766 and 0.875, respectively. The model performed best with longer phases, with 70.6% accuracy for phases that had a duration under 5 min and 88.3% accuracy for longer phases. Discussion: A deep-learning-based approach to CV, previously successful in laparoscopic video phase identification, translates well to endoscopic procedures. With continued refinements, AI could contribute to intra-operative decision-support systems and post-operative risk prediction."
32720165,Artificial intelligence and smartphone program applications (Apps) : Relevance for dermatological practice],A Blum,"Advantages of artificial intelligence (ai): With responsible, safe and successful use of artificial intelligence (AI), possible advantages in the field of dermato-oncology include the following: (1) medical work can focus on skin cancer patients, (2) patients can be more quickly and effectively treated despite the increasing incidence of skin cancer and the decreasing number of actively working dermatologists and (3) users can learn from the AI results. POTENTIAL DISADVANTAGES AND RISKS OF AI USE: (1) Lack of mutual trust can develop due to the decreased patient-physician contact, (2) additional time effort will be necessary to promptly evaluate the AI-classified benign lesions, (3) lack of adequate medical experience to recognize misclassified AI decisions and (4) recontacting a patient in due time in the case of incorrect AI classifications. Still problematic in the use of AI are the medicolegal situation and remuneration. Apps using AI currently cannot provide sufficient assistance based on clinical images of skin cancer. Requirements and possible use of smartphone program applications: Smartphone program applications (apps) can be implemented responsibly when the image quality is good, the patient's history can be entered easily, transmission of the image and results are assured and medicolegal aspects as well as remuneration are clarified. Apps can be used for disease-specific information material and can optimize patient care by using teledermatology."
32719767,COVID-19 Patient Health Prediction Using Boosted Random Forest Algorithm,Celestine Iwendi,"Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in wireless infrastructure, real-time collection, and processing of end-user devices is now in high demand. It is now superlative to use AI to detect and predict pandemics of a colossal nature. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which originated in Wuhan China, has had disastrous effects on the global community and has overburdened advanced healthcare systems throughout the world. Globally; over 4,063,525 confirmed cases and 282,244 deaths have been recorded as of 11th May 2020, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control agency. However, the current rapid and exponential rise in the number of patients has necessitated efficient and quick prediction of the possible outcome of an infected patient for appropriate treatment using AI techniques. This paper proposes a fine-tuned Random Forest model boosted by the AdaBoost algorithm. The model uses the COVID-19 patient's geographical, travel, health, and demographic data to predict the severity of the case and the possible outcome, recovery, or death. The model has an accuracy of 94% and a F1 Score of 0.86 on the dataset used. The data analysis reveals a positive correlation between patients' gender and deaths, and also indicates that the majority of patients are aged between 20 and 70 years."
32719645,Socioemotional Resources Account for Academic Adjustment in Moroccan Adolescents,Daniel Cortés-Denia,"This study aimed to analyze the relationship of both positive socioemotional resources [emotional intelligence (EI) and social support] and negative states (test anxiety and depression) with academic adjustment, as measured by academic performance and self-concept, among Moroccan adolescents. The participants were 845 students from Morocco (372 boys, 473 girls; mean age 15.58 years; SD = 1.69; range = 13-18) who were attending secondary education (79.8%) or high school. The participants completed a questionnaire that included scales to measure the variables of interest, adapted for and validated in Moroccan adolescents. A multiple mediation serial model with four mediator variables confirmed that academic self-concept was positively and directly predicted by EI, academic performance, and social support, whereas test anxiety and depression had a negative effect. Second, EI predicted self-concept through its indirect effects on test anxiety and academic performance, social support, and depression. EI was the most protective factor. This model has good performance in explaining the variation in test anxiety (1.6%), depression (14.2%), social support (9.5%), academic performance (6.8%), and self-concept (35.7%). This study helps clarify the relationship of positive and negative socioemotional states with the academic performance of adolescents in Morocco. This study contributes to the literature by enhancing knowledge of adolescents in societies that, like Morocco, have a less elaborated tradition at these levels of education and that are considering education in their agenda as a way of enhancing national development and promoting EI to allow youth development in a healthier society."
32719644,Does Blindness Boost Working Memory? A Natural Experiment and Cross-Cultural Study,Heiner Rindermann,"Intelligence requires sufficient working-memory capacity. Traditionally, working memory was seen as a process and as a prerequisite for fluid intelligence. Working memory was assumed to be determined by maturation and health. There is a gap in the literature: It is still not fully understood to which extent and how working memory can be influenced. So this study tested how visual impairment and the extent of visual impairment are related to working memory capacity. In our study we compared N = 249 children (6-16 years) with and without visual impairment (blind, visually impaired, and sighted) in two countries (South Africa and Austria) at different development levels on their working-memory capacity and verbal comprehension. Using the WISC-IV, blind and visually impaired children showed higher working-memory capacity than sighted children (r = + 0.35, 14, and 3 IQ points, respectively). On the other hand, visually impaired children showed a weakness in verbal comprehension (r = -0.39, on average 13 IQ points lower). The pattern remained robust when SES and race-ethnicity were controlled. Our natural (quasi-)experiment shows a pattern, which is unlikely to be genetic, and so supports the view that working memory and intelligence scores can be modified."
32719466,"Genetic copy number variants, cognition and psychosis: a meta-analysis and a family study",Johan H Thygesen,"The burden of large and rare copy number genetic variants (CNVs) as well as certain specific CNVs increase the risk of developing schizophrenia. Several cognitive measures are purported schizophrenia endophenotypes and may represent an intermediate point between genetics and the illness. This paper investigates the influence of CNVs on cognition. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature exploring the effect of CNV burden on general intelligence. We included ten primary studies with a total of 18,847 participants and found no evidence of association. In a new psychosis family study, we investigated the effects of CNVs on specific cognitive abilities. We examined the burden of large and rare CNVs (>200 kb, <1% MAF) as well as known schizophrenia-associated CNVs in patients with psychotic disorders, their unaffected relatives and controls (N = 3428) from the Psychosis Endophenotypes International Consortium (PEIC). The carriers of specific schizophrenia-associated CNVs showed poorer performance than non-carriers in immediate (P = 0.0036) and delayed (P = 0.0115) verbal recall. We found suggestive evidence that carriers of schizophrenia-associated CNVs had poorer block design performance (P = 0.0307). We do not find any association between CNV burden and cognition. Our findings show that the known high-risk CNVs are not only associated with schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental disorders, but are also a contributing factor to impairment in cognitive domains such as memory and perceptual reasoning, and act as intermediate biomarkers of disease risk."
32719441,A deep learning approach to identify smoke plumes in satellite imagery in near-real time for health risk communication,Alexandra Larsen,"Background: Wildland fire (wildfire; bushfire) pollution contributes to poor air quality, a risk factor for premature death. The frequency and intensity of wildfires are expected to increase; improved tools for estimating exposure to fire smoke are vital. New-generation satellite-based sensors produce high-resolution spectral images, providing real-time information of surface features during wildfire episodes. Because of the vast size of such data, new automated methods for processing information are required. Objective: We present a deep fully convolutional neural network (FCN) for predicting fire smoke in satellite imagery in near-real time (NRT). Methods: The FCN identifies fire smoke using output from operational smoke identification methods as training data, leveraging validated smoke products in a framework that can be operationalized in NRT. We demonstrate this for a fire episode in Australia; the algorithm is applicable to any geographic region. Results: The algorithm has high classification accuracy (99.5% of pixels correctly classified on average) and precision (average intersection over union = 57.6%). Significance: The FCN algorithm has high potential as an exposure-assessment tool, capable of providing critical information to fire managers, health and environmental agencies, and the general public to prevent the health risks associated with exposure to hazardous smoke from wildland fires in NRT."
32719359,"Genes, the brain, and artificial intelligence in evolution",Naoyuki Kamatani,"Three important systems, genes, the brain, and artificial intelligence (especially deep learning) have similar goals, namely, the maximization of likelihood or minimization of cross-entropy. Animal brains have evolved through predator-prey interactions in which maximizing survival probability and transmission of genes to offspring were the main objectives. Coordinate transformation for a rigid body necessary to win predator-prey battles requires a huge amount of matrix operations in the brain similar to those performed by a powerful GPU. Things (molecules), information (genes), and energy (ATP) are essential for using Maxwell's demon model to understand how a living system maintains a low level of entropy. However, while the history of medicine and biology saw molecular biology and genetics disciplines flourish, the study of energy has been limited, despite estimates that >10% all human genes code energy-related proteins. Since there are a large number of molecular and genetic diseases, many energy-related diseases must exist as well. In addition to mitochondrial disease, common diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, muscle diseases, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes are candidates for diseases related to cellular energy shortage. We are developing ATP enhancer, a drug to treat such diseases. I predict that in the future, the frontier of medicine and biology will involve energy and entropy, and the frontier of science will be about the cognitive processes that scientists' brains use to study mathematics and physics. That will be understood by comparing the abilities that were necessary to survive battles between predators and prey during evolutionary history."
32719039,"Lung involvement in macrophage activation syndrome and severe COVID-19: results from a cross-sectional study to assess clinical, laboratory and artificial intelligence-radiological differences",Piero Ruscitti,"Objectives: To evaluate the clinical pictures, laboratory tests and imaging of patients with lung involvement, either from severe COVID-19 or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), in order to assess how similar these two diseases are. Methods: The present work has been designed as a cross-sectional single-centre study to compare characteristics of patients with lung involvement either from MAS or severe COVID-19. Chest CT scans were assessed by using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based software. Results: Ten patients with MAS and 47 patients with severe COVID-19 with lung involvement were assessed. Although all patients showed fever and dyspnoea, patients with MAS were characterised by thrombocytopaenia, whereas patients with severe COVID-19 were characterised by lymphopaenia and neutrophilia. Higher values of H-score characterised patients with MAS when compared with severe COVID-19. AI-reconstructed images of chest CT scan showed that apical, basal, peripheral and bilateral distributions of ground-glass opacities (GGOs), as well as apical consolidations, were more represented in severe COVID-19 than in MAS. C reactive protein directly correlated with GGOs extension in both diseases. Furthermore, lymphopaenia inversely correlated with GGOs extension in severe COVID-19. Conclusions: Our data could suggest laboratory and radiological differences between MAS and severe COVID-19, paving the way for further hypotheses to be investigated in future confirmatory studies."
32718885,Innovations to improve access to musculoskeletal care,Mellick J Chehade,"Innovation is a form of realising a new way of doing something, often ignoring traditional wisdom, in order to meet new challenges. Globally, particularly in emerging economies, the high burden of musculoskeletal conditions and their contribution to multimorbidity continue to rise, as does the gap for services to deliver essential care. There is a growing need to find solutions to this challenge and deliver person-centred and integrated care, wherein empowering patients with the capacity for self-management is critical. Whilst there is an abundance of information available online to support consumer education, the number of sources for credible medical information is diluted by uninformed anecdotal social media solutions. Even with the provision of high-quality information, behavioural change does not necessarily follow, and more robust educational approaches are required. In this chapter, we examine innovation, its management and the strategic directions required to improve musculoskeletal healthcare at macro (policy), meso (service delivery) and micro (clinical practice) levels. We discuss the critical role of consumer agency (patients and their families/carers) in driving innovation and the need to leverage this through empowerment by education. We provide a snapshot of real-world examples of innovative practices including capacity building in consumer and interprofessional musculoskeletal education and practice; recommendations to transform the access and delivery of integrated, person-centred care; and initiatives in musculoskeletal care and implementation of models of care, enabled by digital health solutions including telehealth, remote monitoring, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology and big data. We provide emerging evidence for how innovation can support systems' strengthening and build capacity to support improved access to 'right' musculoskeletal care, and explore some of the ways to best manage innovations. We conclude with recommended systematic steps to establish required leadership, collaboration, research, networking, dissemination, implementation and evaluation of future innovations in musculoskeletal health and care."
32718867,Social cognition and executive functions in children and adolescents with focal epilepsy,Francesca Felicia Operto,"Objectives: Deficits in facial emotion recognition and Theory of Mind are frequent in patients with epilepsy. Although this evidence, studies on pediatric age are few and the relation between these abilities and other cognitive domain remains to be better elucidated. The purpose of our study is to evaluate facial emotion recognition and Theory of Mind in children and adolescents with focal epilepsy, and correlate them with intelligence and executive functions. Materials and methods: Our work is a cross-sectional observational study. Sixty-two children and adolescents aged between 7-16 years diagnosed by focal epilepsy and 32 sex/age-matched controls were recruited. All participants were administered a standardized battery tests to assess social cognition (NEPSY-II), executive functions (EpiTrack Junior) and cognitive non-verbal level (Raven Progressive Matrices). Results: Emotion recognition mean score was significantly lower in the epilepsy group than in the controls to Student's t-test (p<0.05). Epilepsy group showed an impairment in happiness, sadness, anger and fear recognition, compared to controls (p<0.05). Theory of Mind mean score was also significantly lower in epilepsy group than controls (p<0.05). Deficits in emotion recognition seemed to be related to low age at onset of epilepsy, long duration of disease, low executive functions and low non-verbal intelligence. Deficits in Theory of Mind seemed to be related to a high seizure frequency. Conclusions: Our results suggest that children and adolescents with focal epilepsy had deficit in facial emotion recognition and Theory of Mind, compared to their peer. Both these difficulties seem to be related to some features of epilepsy itself. Our results also suggest that deficits in facial emotion recognition are potentially related to difficulties in executive functions and non-verbal intelligence. More studies are needed to confirm these hypotheses."
32718516,Artificial Intelligence for Personalized Preventive Adolescent Healthcare,Jonathan P Rowe,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are creating new opportunities for personalizing technology-based health interventions to adolescents. This article provides a computer science perspective on how emerging AI technologies-intelligent learning environments, interactive narrative generation, user modeling, and adaptive coaching-can be utilized to model adolescent learning and engagement and deliver personalized support in adaptive health technologies. Many of these technologies have emerged from human-centered applications of AI in education, training, and entertainment. However, their application to improving healthcare, to date, has been comparatively limited. We illustrate the opportunities provided by AI-driven adaptive technologies for adolescent preventive healthcare by describing a vision of how future adolescent preventive health interventions might be delivered both inside and outside of the clinic. Key challenges posed by AI-driven health technologies are also presented, including issues of privacy, ethics, encoded bias, and integration into clinical workflows and adolescent lives. Examples of empirical findings about the effectiveness of AI technologies for user modeling and adaptive coaching are presented, which underscore their promise for application toward adolescent health. The article concludes with a brief discussion of future research directions for the field, which is well positioned to leverage AI to improve adolescent health and well-being."
32718161,"Equivalence of remote, digital administration and traditional, in-person administration of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V)",A Jordan Wright,"Many children in need do not receive the psychoeducational evaluation services they need, with an estimated 15% of all students struggling with attentional or learning difficulties that are unassessed, and thus unaddressed, during ""normal"" times. Such evaluations have largely halted during the COVID-19 crisis, with questionable psychometrics of usable measures and clinicians largely unprepared to administer them. Remote, online psychoeducational evaluations have the potential to decrease this access problem by allowing for evaluations to continue during the crisis, as well as redistributing (geographically and potentially socioeconomically) evaluators to populations disproportionately without access. The present study evaluated the equivalence of a remote, online administration procedure for the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V) with traditional, in-person administration. Results revealed no significant differences-and, therefore, method effects-between the full-scale IQ and index scores between the administration procedures. One subtest did reveal a significant method effect, with children performing more poorly on the remote, online version of the test. Although imperfect, the remote, online procedure is a viable alternative for the traditional, in-person administration of the WISC-V, especially during this time of crisis.

32717966,Facial Emotion Recognition in Children and Adolescents with Specific Learning Disorder,Francesca Felicia Operto,"Background: Some recent studies suggest that children and adolescents with different neurodevelopmental disorders perform worse in emotions recognition through facial expressions (ER) compared with typically developing peers. This impairment is also described in children with Specific Learning Disorders (SLD), compromising their scholastic achievement, social functioning, and quality of life. The purpose of our study is to evaluate ER skills in children and adolescents with SLD compared to a control group without learning disorders, and correlate them with intelligence and executive functions. Materials and methods: Our work is a cross-sectional observational study. Sixty-three children and adolescents aged between 8 and 16 years, diagnosed with SLD, and 32 sex/age-matched controls without learning disorders were recruited. All participants were administered standardized neuropsychological tests, evaluating facial emotion recognition (NEPSY-II), executive functions (EpiTrack Junior), and intelligence profile (WISC-IV). Results: Emotion recognition mean score was significantly lower in the SLD group than in the controls group on the Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples (p < 0.001). The SLD group performed significantly lower than the control group in their abilities to identify neutral expressions, happiness, sadness, anger, and fear compared to controls (p < 0.001). ER scores were positively correlated to the executive functions scores. There was no correlation with the Total Intelligence Quotient scores but there is a significant positive correlation with Working Memory Index and Processing Speed Index measured by WISC.IV. Conclusion: Our study showed that children and adolescents with Specific Learning Disorders have facial emotion recognition impairment when compared with a group of peers without learning disorders. ER abilities were independent of their global intelligence but potentially related to executive functions."
32717952,"Advances of RRAM Devices: Resistive Switching Mechanisms, Materials and Bionic Synaptic Application",Zongjie Shen,"Resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices are receiving increasing extensive attention due to their enhanced properties such as fast operation speed, simple device structure, low power consumption, good scalability potential and so on, and are currently considered to be one of the next-generation alternatives to traditional memory. In this review, an overview of RRAM devices is demonstrated in terms of thin film materials investigation on electrode and function layer, switching mechanisms and artificial intelligence applications. Compared with the well-developed application of inorganic thin film materials (oxides, solid electrolyte and two-dimensional (2D) materials) in RRAM devices, organic thin film materials (biological and polymer materials) application is considered to be the candidate with significant potential. The performance of RRAM devices is closely related to the investigation of switching mechanisms in this review, including thermal-chemical mechanism (TCM), valance change mechanism (VCM) and electrochemical metallization (ECM). Finally, the bionic synaptic application of RRAM devices is under intensive consideration, its main characteristics such as potentiation/depression response, short-/long-term plasticity (STP/LTP), transition from short-term memory to long-term memory (STM to LTM) and spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) reveal the great potential of RRAM devices in the field of neuromorphic application."
32717937,e-Health: A Future Solution for Optimized Management of Elderly Patients. GER-e-TEC™ Project,Abrar-Ahmad Zulfiqar,"Background: Elderly residents in nursing homes have multiple comorbidities (including cognitive and psycho-behavioral pathologies, malnutrition, heart failure, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure) and use multiple medications. Methods: The GER-e-TEC project aims to provide these fragile and complex patients with telemedicine tools, more specifically telemonitoring, backed by a well-defined and personalized protocol. Results: Medically, this implies the need for regular monitoring and a high level of medical and multidisciplinary expertise for the healthcare team. The tools use non-invasive communicating sensors and artificial intelligence techniques, allowing daily monitoring with the ability to detect any abnormal changes in the patient's condition early. Conclusions: The GER-e-TEC project specifically considers the challenges of aging residents and significant challenges in nursing homes, with the main geriatric syndromes (falls, malnutrition, cognitive-behavioral disorders, and iatrogenic conditions)."
32717428,Recent theranostic paradigms for the management of Age-related macular degeneration,Reshal Suri,"Degenerative diseases of eye like Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), that affects the central portion of the retina (macula), is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide especially in the elderly population. It is classified mainly as wet and dry form. With expanding knowledge about the underlying pathophysiology of the disease, various treatment strategies are being employed to halt the course of the disease progression. Hitherto, there is no ideal therapy which can cure the disease completely, and targeting the posterior segment of the eye is yet another challenge. The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent advances in the management and treatment stratagems (therapies, delivery systems and diagnostic tools) pertaining to AMD viz. molecular targeting, stem cell therapy, nanotechnology and exosomes with special reference to newer technologies like artificial intelligence and 3D printing. Furthermore, the role of diet and nutritional supplements in the prevention and treatment of the disease has also been highlighted. The alarming increase in the said disorder around the globe demands exhaustive research and investigations in the treatment zone. This review thus additionally directs the attention towards the challenges and future perspectives of different treatment approaches for AMD."
32717160,Improving Service User Involvement in Mental Health Nursing Education: Suggestions from Those with Lived Experience,Aine Horgan,"Service user involvement in mental health nursing education is increasing and a developing evidence base is demonstrating more positive attitudes towards people labelled with a mental illness. To date, most research on this approach has focussed on the perspectives of nursing students, with very limited research drawing on the expertise and opinions of service users. The aim of this study was to explore potential improvements in mental health nursing education, and ways service user involvement can be enhanced as defined by service users themselves. An international qualitative research project was undertaken involving focus groups with service users (n = 50) from Australia and five European countries. The research was coproduced between Experts by Experience (service users) and mental health nurse academics. Data were analysed thematically. Findings reflected two broad themes: (1) improvements to content, including: further emphasis on developing emotional intelligence, understanding mental distress and broader context of care; (2) Improvements to service user involvement, including: support, format, and teaching and learning techniques. These findings provide direction for maximising the benefits of service user involvement and show the value of the expertise of service users."
32716957,Early-Onset Schizophrenia in a paediatric population of French psychiatric and medico-social care centres: A cross sectional study,Emmanuelle Dor-Nedonsel,"Background: Early-Onset Schizophrenia (EOS) is rare but severe mental health disorder in children and adolescents. Diagnosis of schizophrenia before the age of 18 years remains complex and challenging, especially in young children. In France, there are no recent reliable epidemiological data about the prevalence of EOS. The present study evaluates the EOS rate in a target clinical population of children and adolescents in psychiatric and medico-social care centres in the South-East of France. Methods: Psychiatric and medico-social centres for children and adolescent in the geographical area have been contacted, and after receiving their agreement to participate in the study, eligible patients corresponding to inclusion criteria were selected based on patients' medical records. Main inclusion criteria were age 7 to 17 years and intelligence quotient > 35. EOS categorical diagnosis was assessed by Kiddie-SADS Present and Lifetime psychosis section. Results: 37 centres participated and 302 subjects have been included in the study. The main result was the categorical diagnosis of EOS in 27 subjects, corresponding to a rate of 8.9% in the study population. Half of the patients presented mild to moderate intellectual deficiency. Interestingly, only 2.3% had a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder noted in their medical records before standardized assessment. Conclusions: The results of the study highlight the importance of using a standardized diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the paediatric population. In fact, EOS might be underdiagnosed in children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders and subnormal cognitive functioning. Trial registration: NCT01512641.

32716749,The Road Not Mapped: The Neuroethics Roadmap on Research with Nonhuman Primates,L Syd M Johnson,"We have arrived at an inflection point, a moment in history when the sentience, consciousness, intelligence, agency, and even the moral agency of many nonhuman animals can no longer be questioned without ignoring centuries of accumulated scientific knowledge. Nowhere is this more true than in our understanding of nonhuman primates (NHPs). A neuroethics committed to probing the ethical implications of brain research must be able to respond to and anticipate the challenges ahead as brain projects globally prepare to increase the use of NHPs in research. This requires adopting a less anthropocentric focus that includes nonhuman animals within its scope. But the Neuroethics Roadmap represents a missed opportunity to critically examine the future direction of research with NHPs in an ethically-responsive neuroscience."
32716709,Epidemiology of Atrial Fibrillation in the 21st Century: Novel Methods and New Insights,Jelena Kornej,"Accompanying the aging of populations worldwide, and increased survival with chronic diseases, the incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) are rising, justifying the term global epidemic. This multifactorial arrhythmia is intertwined with common concomitant cardiovascular diseases, which share classical cardiovascular risk factors. Targeted prevention programs are largely missing. Prevention needs to start at an early age with primordial interventions at the population level. The public health dimension of AF motivates research in modifiable AF risk factors and improved precision in AF prediction and management. In this review, we summarize current knowledge in an attempt to untangle these multifaceted associations from an epidemiological perspective. We discuss disease trends, preventive opportunities offered by underlying risk factors and concomitant disorders, current developments in diagnosis and risk prediction, and prognostic implications of AF and its complications. Finally, we review current technological (eg, eHealth) and methodological (artificial intelligence) advances and their relevance for future prevention and disease management."
32716663,Phthalate and Bisphenol Exposure during Pregnancy and Offspring Nonverbal IQ,Michiel A van den Dries,"Background: Prenatal exposures to phthalates and bisphenols are associated with impaired brain development in animals. However, epidemiological studies investigating the association between prenatal phthalate or bisphenol exposure and cognition have produced mixed findings and mostly had modest sample sizes and measured the exposure during the third trimester. Objective: We examined the association between pregnancy maternal urinary biomarkers of phthalate or bisphenol exposure and nonverbal intelligence quotient (IQ) in children 6 years of age. Method: The study sample consisted of 1,282 mother-child pairs participating in the Generation R Study, a population-based birth cohort in Rotterdam, Netherlands (enrollment 2002-2006). We measured maternal urinary concentrations of 18 phthalate metabolites and 8 bisphenols at <18, 18-25, and >25 wks of gestation. Child nonverbal IQ was measured at 6 years of age using the Snijders-Oomen Nonverbal Intelligence Test-Revised. Linear regression models were fit for each of the three collection phases separately, the three collection phases jointly, and for the averaged prenatal exposure across pregnancy. Results: Higher urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites during early pregnancy were associated with lower child nonverbal IQ score [e.g., B per 10-fold increase in summed low-molecular weight phthalates=-1.7 (95% CI: -3.1, -0.3)]. This association remained unchanged when adjusted for mid and late pregnancy exposures. We also observed an inverse association between late pregnancy di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP) exposure and nonverbal IQ. Maternal urinary concentrations of bisphenols were not associated with child nonverbal IQ. There was no effect estimate modification by sex. Conclusions: We did not observe that maternal biomarkers of bisphenol exposure are associated with nonverbal IQ. We found that phthalate exposure in early pregnancy and DNOP exposure in late pregnancy are associated with lower nonverbal IQ scores in children. Our results might suggest that particularly early pregnancy is a sensitive window of phthalate exposure, but future studies are needed to replicate our findings. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6047."
32716305,An Artificial Intelligence Fusion Model for Cardiac Emergency Decision Making: Application and Robustness Analysis,Liheng Gong,"Background: During cardiac emergency medical treatment, reducing the incidence of avoidable adverse events, ensuring the safety of patients, and generally improving the quality and efficiency of medical treatment have been important research topics in theoretical and practical circles. Objective: This paper examines the robustness of the decision-making reasoning process from the overall perspective of the cardiac emergency medical system. Methods: The principle of robustness was introduced into our study on the quality and efficiency of cardiac emergency decision making. We propose the concept of robustness for complex medical decision making by targeting the problem of low reasoning efficiency and accuracy in cardiac emergency decision making. The key bottlenecks such as anti-interference capability, fault tolerance, and redundancy were studied. The rules of knowledge acquisition and transfer in the decision-making process were systematically analyzed to reveal the core role of knowledge reasoning. Results: The robustness threshold method was adopted to construct the robustness criteria group of the system, and the fusion and coordination mechanism was realized through information entropy, information gain, and mutual information methods. Conclusions: A set of fusion models and robust threshold methods such as the R2CMIFS (treatment mode of fibroblastic sarcoma) model and the RTCRF (clinical trial observation mode) model were proposed. Our study enriches the theoretical research on robustness in this field."

32715508,Diagnosis of pharyngeal cancer on endoscopic video images by Mask region-based convolutional neural network,Mitsuhiro Kono,"Objectives: We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system for the real-time diagnosis of pharyngeal cancers. Methods: Endoscopic video images and still images of pharyngeal cancer treated in our facility were collected. A total of 4559 images of pathologically proven pharyngeal cancer (1243 using white light imaging and 3316 using narrow-band imaging/blue laser imaging) from 276 patients were used as a training dataset. The AI system used a convolutional neural network (CNN) model typical of the type used to analyze visual imagery. Supervised learning was used to train the CNN. The AI system was evaluated using an independent validation dataset of 25 video images of pharyngeal cancer and 36 video images of normal pharynx taken at our hospital. Results: The AI system diagnosed 23/25 (92%) pharyngeal cancers as cancers and 17/36 (47%) non-cancers as non-cancers. The transaction speed of the AI system was 0.03 s per image, which meets the required speed for real-time diagnosis. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the detection of cancer were 92%, 47%, and 66% respectively. Conclusions: Our single-institution study showed that our AI system for diagnosing cancers of the pharyngeal region had promising performance with high sensitivity and acceptable specificity. Further training and improvement of the system are required with a larger dataset including multiple centers."
32715431,Three Flavorings for a Soup to Cure what Ails Mental Health Services,C Hendricks Brown,"With new tools from artificial intelligence and new perspectives on personalizing interventions, we could revolutionize the way mental health services are delivered and achieve major gains in improving the public's mental health. We examine Dr. Bickman's vision around these technological and paradigm changes that would usher in major scientific, workforce training, and societal cultural changes. We argue that additional efforts in research evaluations in implementation have the potential to scale up and adapt existing interventions and scale them out to diverse populations and service systems. The next stage of this work involves testing the effectiveness of personalized interventions that are preferred by the public and integrating these choices into sustainable service systems. We note cautions on the delivery of these programs as automated algorithmic recommendations are heretofore foreign to humans."
32715430,Can Artificial Intelligence Improve Psychotherapy Research and Practice?,Rachel L Horn,"Leonard Bickman's article on the future of artificial intelligence (AI) in psychotherapy research paints an encouraging picture of the progress to be made in this field. We support his perspective, but we also offer some cautionary notes about the boost AI can provide. We suggest that AI is not likely to transform psychotherapy research or practice to the degree seen in pharmacology and medicine because the factors that contribute to treatment response in these realms differ so markedly from one another, and in ways that do not favor advances in psychotherapy. Despite this limitation, it seems likely that AI will have a beneficial impact, improving empirical analysis through data-driven model development, tools for addressing the limitations of traditional regression methods, and novel means of personalizing treatment. In addition, AI has the potential to augment the reach of the researcher and therapist by expanding our ability to gather data and deliver interventions beyond the confines of the lab or clinical office."
32715429,Working Towards the Development and Implementation of Precision Mental Healthcare: An Example,Wolfgang Lutz,"Leonard Bickman's (2020) Festschrift paper in the special issue ""The Future of Children's Mental Health Services"" on improving mental health services is an impressive reflection of his career, highlighting his major insights and the development of mental health services research as a whole. Five major difficulties in this field's current research and practice are attentively delineated: poor diagnostics, measurement problems, disadvantages of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), lack of feedback and personalized treatments. Dr. Bickman recommends possible solutions based on his extensive experience and empirical findings. We agree with his thoughts and illustrate how we, challenged with the same problems, have attempted to develop clinically informed research and evidence-based clinical practice. A comprehensive feedback system that deals with the aforementioned problems is briefly described. It includes pre-treatment recommendations for treatment strategies and an empirically informed dropout prediction based on a variety of data sources. In addition to treatment recommendations, continuous feedback as well as individualized treatment adaptation tools are provided during ongoing therapy. New projects are being implemented to further improve the system by including new data assessment strategies and sources, e.g., ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and automated video analysis."

32715351,Digital Pharmaceutical Sciences,Safa A Damiati,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, in particular, have gained significant interest in many fields, including pharmaceutical sciences. The enormous growth of data from several sources, the recent advances in various analytical tools, and the continuous developments in machine learning algorithms have resulted in a rapid increase in new machine learning applications in different areas of pharmaceutical sciences. This review summarizes the past, present, and potential future impacts of machine learning technologies on different areas of pharmaceutical sciences, including drug design and discovery, preformulation, and formulation. The machine learning methods commonly used in pharmaceutical sciences are discussed, with a specific emphasis on artificial neural networks due to their capability to model the nonlinear relationships that are commonly encountered in pharmaceutical research. AI and machine learning technologies in common day-to-day pharma needs as well as industrial and regulatory insights are reviewed. Beyond traditional potentials of implementing digital technologies using machine learning in the development of more efficient, fast, and economical solutions in pharmaceutical sciences are also discussed."
32715331,The automaton as a surgeon: the future of artificial intelligence in emergency and general surgery,Lara Rimmer,"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field involving computational simulation of human intelligence processes; these applications of deep learning could have implications in the specialty of emergency surgery (ES). ES is a rapidly advancing area, and this review will outline the most recent advances. Methods: A literature search encompassing the uses of AI in surgery was conducted across large databases (Pubmed, OVID, SCOPUS). Two doctors (LR, CH) both collated relevant papers and appraised them. Papers included were published within the last 5 years, and a ""snowball effect"" used to collate further relevant literature. Results: AI has been shown to provide value in predicting surgical outcomes and giving personalised patient risks based on inputted data. Further to this, image recognition technology within AI has showed success in fracture identification and breast cancer diagnosis. Regarding theatre presence, supervised robots have carried out suturing and anastomosis of bowel in controlled environments to a high standard. Conclusion: AI has potential for integration across surgical services, from diagnosis to treatment, and aiding the surgeon in key decision-making for risks per patient. Fully automated surgery may be the future, but at present, AI needs human supervision."
32715259,"Very Thin, Macroscale, Flexible, Tactile Pressure Sensor Sheet",Seiji Wakabayashi,"In artificial intelligence and deep learning applications, data collection from a variety of objects is of great interest. One way to support such data collection is to use very thin, mechanically flexible sensor sheets, which can cover an object without altering the original shape. This study proposes a thin, macroscale, flexible, tactile pressure sensor array fabricated by a simple process for economical device applications. Using laser-induced graphene, a transfer process, and a printing method, a relatively stable, reliable, macroscale, thin (∼300 μm), flexible, tactile pressure sensor is realized. The detectable pressure range is about tens to hundreds of kPa. Then, as a proof-of-concept, the uniformity, sensitivity, repeatability, object mapping, finger pressure distribution, and pressure mapping are demonstrated under bending conditions. Although many flexible, tactile pressure sensors have been reported, the proposed structure has the potential for macroscale, thin, flexible, tactile pressure sensor sheets because of the simple and easy fabrication process."

In this study, an artificial neural network is used to develop different models for the prediction of various rheological parameters such as shear stress, apparent viscosity, plastic viscosity, and yield point of a class G cement slurry with nanoclay as an additive. An extensive experimental study was conducted to generate enough data set for the training of artificial intelligence models. The class G oil well cement slurries were prepared by fixing the water-cement ratio to 0.44 and adding organically modified nanoclays as a strength enhancer. The rheological properties of the oil well cement slurries were investigated at a wide range of temperatures (37 ≤ T ≤ 90 °C) and shear rates (5 ≤ γ ≤ 500 s-1). Experimental data generated were used for the training of feed-forward neural networks. The predicted values of the rheological properties from the trained model showed a good agreement when compared with the experimental values. The average absolute percentage error was less than 5% in both training and validation phases of modeling. A trend analysis was carried out to ensure that the proposed models can define the underlying physics. From the validation and the trend analysis, it was found that the new models can be used to predict cement rheological properties within the range of data set on which the models were trained. The proposed models are independent of laboratory-dependent variables and can give quick and real-time values of the rheological parameters."
32714943,Improving the Generalizability of Convolutional Neural Network-Based Segmentation on CMR Images,Chen Chen,"Background: Convolutional neural network (CNN) based segmentation methods provide an efficient and automated way for clinicians to assess the structure and function of the heart in cardiac MR images. While CNNs can generally perform the segmentation tasks with high accuracy when training and test images come from the same domain (e.g., same scanner or site), their performance often degrades dramatically on images from different scanners or clinical sites. Methods: We propose a simple yet effective way for improving the network generalization ability by carefully designing data normalization and augmentation strategies to accommodate common scenarios in multi-site, multi-scanner clinical imaging data sets. We demonstrate that a neural network trained on a single-site single-scanner dataset from the UK Biobank can be successfully applied to segmenting cardiac MR images across different sites and different scanners without substantial loss of accuracy. Specifically, the method was trained on a large set of 3,975 subjects from the UK Biobank. It was then directly tested on 600 different subjects from the UK Biobank for intra-domain testing and two other sets for cross-domain testing: the ACDC dataset (100 subjects, 1 site, 2 scanners) and the BSCMR-AS dataset (599 subjects, 6 sites, 9 scanners). Results: The proposed method produces promising segmentation results on the UK Biobank test set which are comparable to previously reported values in the literature, while also performing well on cross-domain test sets, achieving a mean Dice metric of 0.90 for the left ventricle, 0.81 for the myocardium, and 0.82 for the right ventricle on the ACDC dataset; and 0.89 for the left ventricle, 0.83 for the myocardium on the BSCMR-AS dataset. Conclusions: The proposed method offers a potential solution to improve CNN-based model generalizability for the cross-scanner and cross-site cardiac MR image segmentation task."
32714386,"COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Risk Assessment, Shared Molecular Pathways, and Therapeutic Challenges",Iolanda Valentina Popa,"Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 disease is yielding a global outbreak with severe threats to public health. In this paper, we aimed at reviewing the current knowledge about COVID-19 infectious risk status in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients requiring immunosuppressive medication. We also focused on several molecular insights that could explain why IBD patients appear not to have higher risks of infection and worse outcomes in COVID-19 than the general population in an attempt to provide scientific support for safer decisions in IBD patient care. Methods: PubMed electronic database was interrogated for relevant articles involving data about common molecular pathways and shared treatment strategies between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Besides, Neural Covidex, an artificial intelligence tool, was used to answer queries about pathogenic coronaviruses and possible IBD interactions using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). Discussions. Few molecular and therapeutic interactions between IBD and pathogenic coronaviruses were explored. First, we showed how the activity of soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, CD209L other receptors, and phosphorylated α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 might exert protective impact in IBD in case of coronavirus infection. Second, IBD medication was discussed in the context of possible beneficial effects on COVID-19 pathogeny, including ""cytokine storm"" prevention and treatment, immunomodulation, interferon signaling blocking, and viral endocytosis inhibition. Conclusions: Using the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other pathogenic coronaviruses immunopathology, we showed why IBD patients should not be considered at an increased risk of infection or more severe outcomes. Whether our findings are entirely applicable to the pathogenesis, disease susceptibility, and treatment management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD must be further explored."
32714165,Brain Cortex Activity in Children With Anterior Open Bite: A Pilot Study,Claudia Restrepo,"Anterior open bite (AOB) is related to functional alterations of the stomatognathic system. There are no studies concerning brain activation of the cortex comparing children with and without AOB during rest and activities such as deglutition and phonation. The aim of this study was to determine the activity of the brain cortex of children with AOB at rest and during phonation and deglutition and to evaluate the association of intelligence quotient (IQ), attention (Test of Variables of Attention, known as TOVA), beats per minute (BPM), and oxygen saturation measurement (SpO2) with brain activity in subjects with AOB. Fourteen children (seven with AOB and seven without AOB) with mixed dentition, aged 10-13 years, underwent an IQ test, TOVA, SpO2, and quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG). Electrodes were set in the scalp, according to the 10-20 protocol. Data were analyzed using statistical tests to assess comparisons between children with and without AOB. The results showed that IQ, TOVA, SpO2, or BPM did not show any statistically significant differences between the groups, except for the response time (contained in TOVA) (p = 0.03). Significant differences were found for the brain activity during rest (Condition 1) of the tongue, between children with and without AOB (p < 0.05 for alpha/theta and alpha peaks), whereas there were no differences during function (Condition 2). The findings of this investigation provide insights about the cortex activity of the brain while the tongue is in the resting position in children with AOB. This may imply an altered activity of the brain cortex, which should be considered when diagnosing and treating AOB. Other diagnostic techniques derived from investigations based on neuroscience could develop new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques to give better solutions to children with malocclusions. Treatments should be focused not only on the teeth but also on the brain cortex."
32714130,Understanding Graph Isomorphism Network for rs-fMRI Functional Connectivity Analysis,Byung-Hoon Kim,"Graph neural networks (GNN) rely on graph operations that include neural network training for various graph related tasks. Recently, several attempts have been made to apply the GNNs to functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) data. Despite recent progresses, a common limitation is its difficulty to explain the classification results in a neuroscientifically explainable way. Here, we develop a framework for analyzing the fMRI data using the Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN), which was recently proposed as a powerful GNN for graph classification. One of the important contributions of this paper is the observation that the GIN is a dual representation of convolutional neural network (CNN) in the graph space where the shift operation is defined using the adjacency matrix. This understanding enables us to exploit CNN-based saliency map techniques for the GNN, which we tailor to the proposed GIN with one-hot encoding, to visualize the important regions of the brain. We validate our proposed framework using large-scale resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data for classifying the sex of the subject based on the graph structure of the brain. The experiment was consistent with our expectation such that the obtained saliency map show high correspondence with previous neuroimaging evidences related to sex differences."
32714121,Summoning a New Artificial Intelligence Patent Model: In The Age Of Pandemic,Shlomit Yanisky-Ravid,"To combat the fast-moving spread of the pandemic we need an equally speedy and powerful tool. On the forefront against COVID-19, for example, AI technology has become a digital armament in the development of new drugs, vaccines, diagnostic methods, and forecasting programs. Patenting these new, nonobvious, and efficient technological solutions is a critical step in fostering the research and development, the huge investments as well as the commercial processes. This article considers the challenges of the current patent law as they apply to AI inventions in general and especially in the age of a global pandemic. The article proposes a novel solution to the hurdles of patenting AI technology by establishing a new patent track model for AI inventions (including the inventions that are made by AI systems and creative AI systems themselves). Unlike other publications promoting either complete abandonment of AI related patents, or advocating to maintain current patent laws, or recommending minor adjustment to patent laws, this article suggests a novel model of separate patent venue solely targeting AI inventions. The argument of this article is based on four pillars: the difficulty of having a patent-eligible subject matter, the hurdle of the ""blackbox"" conundrum, the confusion of who is ""a person of ordinary skills in the art"" (""POSITA""), and the criticality of establishing a new AI patent track model, a crucial step, especially during a global epidemic. The first pillar of the argument is the difficulty of having a patent-eligible subject matter in AI inventions. We therefore propose the new AI patent track model that would extend the scope of patent protection to cover creative AI systems, including both the algorithms and trained models, and AI-made inventions in order to, inter alia, incentivize investments of the ""Multi-Players"". The second pillar of the argument of the argument is the hurdle posed by the ""blackbox"" conundrum of AI systems that undermines the explainability and transparency of the inventions. In analogy to already existing rules applied to microorganism patents that are hard to describe, we advise a depository rule for AI working models to sufficiently describe the otherwise inexplicable inventions. The third pillar arises from the confusion of who is a person of ordinary skills in regard to the nonobviousness assessment of AI inventions. We submit an alternative standard of ""a skilled person using an ordinary AI tool in the art"" under the new track model to enable the evaluation of the patentability of complex AI inventions. The fourth pillar of the argument is the criticality of establishing a new AI patent track model on the grounds that the current patent law regime has posed substantial hurdles and uncertainties for patenting AI inventions with regard to almost all patentability requirements. We analyzed each of the requirements to demonstrate that most, if not all, aspects of patent law are not suitable in the AI era; only a revolutionary new patent model specific for AI inventions could solve all the concerns while maintaining the patent incentive for innovations. Our model also suggests an expedited examination with the aid of AI tools and a shortened patent lifetime in light of the fast AI development and technology elimination speed. The article concludes with the hope to harness AI technology for the wellbeing of humanity, in general and especially during tough times in the current COVID-19 era and in general."
32713541,"The value of artificial neural networks for predicting length of stay, discharge disposition, and inpatient costs after anatomic and reverse shoulder arthroplasty",Jaret M Karnuta,"Hypothesis/purpose: The objective is to develop and validate an artificial intelligence model, specifically an artificial neural network (ANN), to predict length of stay (LOS), discharge disposition, and inpatient charges for primary anatomic total (aTSA), reverse total (rTSA), and hemi- (HSA) shoulder arthroplasty to establish internal validity in predicting patient-specific value metrics. Methods: Using data from the National Inpatient Sample between 2003 and 2014, 4 different ANN models to predict LOS, discharge disposition, and inpatient costs using 39 preoperative variables were developed based on diagnosis and arthroplasty type: primary chronic/degenerative aTSA, primary chronic/degenerative rTSA, primary traumatic/acute rTSA, and primary acute/traumatic HSA. Models were also combined into diagnosis type only. Outcome metrics included accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) for a receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: A total of 111,147 patients undergoing primary shoulder replacement were included. The machine learning algorithm predicting the overall chronic/degenerative conditions model (aTSA, rTSA) achieved accuracies of 76.5%, 91.8%, and 73.1% for total cost, LOS, and disposition, respectively; AUCs were 0.75, 0.89, and 0.77 for total cost, LOS, and disposition, respectively. The overall acute/traumatic conditions model (rTSA, HSA) had accuracies of 70.3%, 79.1%, and 72.0% and AUCs of 0.72, 0.78, and 0.79 for total cost, LOS, and discharge disposition, respectively. Conclusion: Our ANN demonstrated fair to good accuracy and reliability for predicting inpatient cost, LOS, and discharge disposition in shoulder arthroplasty for both chronic/degenerative and acute/traumatic conditions. Machine learning has the potential to preoperatively predict costs, LOS, and disposition using patient-specific data for expectation management between health care providers, patients, and payers."
32713248,Beyond the Emoticon: Are There Unintentional Cues of Emotion in Email?,Hayley Blunden,"Email and text-based communication have become ubiquitous. Although recent findings indicate emotional equivalence between face-to-face and email communication, there is limited evidence of nonverbal behaviors in text-based communication, especially the kinds of unintentional displays central to emotion perception in face-to-face interactions. We investigate whether unintentional emotion cues occur in text-based communication by proposing that communication mistakes (e.g., typos) influence emotion perception. Across six studies, we show that communication errors amplify perceptions of email sender's emotions-both negative (Studies 1A-2, 4, 5) and positive (Study 3). Furthermore, by contrasting perceptions of message senders who make mistakes in emotional versus unemotional contexts (Study 5), we show that people partially excuse message sender communication errors in emotional (versus unemotional) contexts, attributing such mistakes to the sender's emotional state rather than solely their intelligence level. These studies suggest that nonverbal behavior in text-based and face-to-face communication may be more comparable than previously thought."
32713236,Differences in Executive Functions in Minors Suffering Physical Abuse and Neglect,Juan Manuel Moreno-Manso,"This research analyzes the executive functions in minors between 7 and 16 years of age who have suffered physical abuse and neglect, as well as minors in residential care centers with other measures of protection. Most studies focus on the neurobiological consequences of the abuse, and mainly at an early age. However, there are very few studies that analyze the executive functions of victims of child abuse, while also taking into account the type of abuse suffered. This study aims to identify whether the consequences of child abuse for the executive functions are different for those minors who have been victims of physical abuse and neglect, in comparison with minors with other protective measures. The participants were 44 minors who had suffered child abuse and 24 minors with other protective measures, distinct from abuse. Three neuropsychological tests were used: (a) the Five Digits Test (FDT), (b) the Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome in Children (BADS-C), and (c) the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-V (WISC-V). The results showed difficulties in those minors who had been victim of physical abuse and neglect, in their cognitive flexibility capabilities, inhibitory control, the ability to take decisions, the ability to organize and plan their behavior, control of emotions, and attention control. It was the minors who were victims of physical neglect that showed the greatest difficulties in their executive functions. The results of the study will permit us to design an educational intervention in the residential care centers that can encourage advances in the affected areas through the setting up of different strategies to favor the stimulation, reinforcement, and rehabilitation of the executive functions."
32712938,An intelligent way for discerning plastics at the shorelines and the seas,Kyriaki Kylili,"Irrespective of how plastics litter the coastline or enter the sea, they pose a major threat to birds and marine life alike. In this study, an artificial intelligence tool was used to create an image classifier based on a convolutional neural network architecture that utilises the bottleneck method. The trained bottleneck method classifier was able to categorise plastics encountered either at the shoreline or floating at the sea surface into eight distinct classes, namely, plastic bags, bottles, buckets, food wrappings, straws, derelict nets, fish, and other objects. Discerning objects with a success rate of 90%, the proposed deep learning approach constitutes a leap towards the smart identification of plastics at the coastline and the sea. Training and testing loss and accuracy results for a range of epochs and batch sizes have lent credibility to the proposed method. Results originating from a resolution sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the prediction technique retains its ability to correctly identify plastics even when image resolution was downsized by 75%. Intelligent tools, such as the one suggested here, can replace manual sorting of macroplastics from human operators revealing, for the first time, the true scale of the amount of plastic polluting our beaches and the seas."
32712656,Automatic detection of hand hygiene using computer vision technology,Amit Singh,"Objective: Hand hygiene is essential for preventing hospital-acquired infections but is difficult to accurately track. The gold-standard (human auditors) is insufficient for assessing true overall compliance. Computer vision technology has the ability to perform more accurate appraisals. Our primary objective was to evaluate if a computer vision algorithm could accurately observe hand hygiene dispenser use in images captured by depth sensors. Materials and methods: Sixteen depth sensors were installed on one hospital unit. Images were collected continuously from March to August 2017. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, a machine learning algorithm was trained to detect hand hygiene dispenser use in the images. The algorithm's accuracy was then compared with simultaneous in-person observations of hand hygiene dispenser usage. Concordance rate between human observation and algorithm's assessment was calculated. Ground truth was established by blinded annotation of the entire image set. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for both human and machine-level observation. Results: A concordance rate of 96.8% was observed between human and algorithm (kappa = 0.85). Concordance among the 3 independent auditors to establish ground truth was 95.4% (Fleiss's kappa = 0.87). Sensitivity and specificity of the machine learning algorithm were 92.1% and 98.3%, respectively. Human observations showed sensitivity and specificity of 85.2% and 99.4%, respectively. Conclusions: A computer vision algorithm was equivalent to human observation in detecting hand hygiene dispenser use. Computer vision monitoring has the potential to provide a more complete appraisal of hand hygiene activity in hospitals than the current gold-standard given its ability for continuous coverage of a unit in space and time."
32712571,Deep learning analysis in coronary computed tomographic angiography imaging for the assessment of patients with coronary artery stenosis,Dan Han,"Background and objective: Recently, deep convolutional neural network has significantly improved image classification and image segmentation. If coronary artery disease (CAD) can be diagnosed through machine learning and deep learning, it will significantly reduce the burdens of the doctors and accelerate the critical patient diagnoses. The purpose of the study is to assess the practicability of utilizing deep learning approaches to process coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) imaging (termed CCTA-artificial intelligence, CCTA-AI) in coronary artery stenosis. Materials and methods: A CCTA reconstruction pipeline was built by utilizing deep learning and transfer learning approaches to generate auto-reconstructed CCTA images based on a series of two-dimensional (2D) CT images. 150 patients who underwent successively CCTA and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) from June 2017 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The dataset was divided into two parts comprising training dataset and testing dataset. The training dataset included the CCTA images of 100 patients which are trained using convolutional neural networks (CNN) in order to further identify various plaque classifications and coronary stenosis. The other 50 CAD patients acted as testing dataset that is evaluated by comparing the auto-reconstructed CCTA images with traditional CCTA images on the condition that DSA images are regarded as the reference method. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used for statistical analysis to compare CCTA-AI with DSA and traditional CCTA in the aspect of detecting coronary stenosis and plaque features. Results: AI significantly reduces time for post-processing and diagnosis comparing to the traditional methods. In identifying various degrees of coronary stenosis, the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA-AI is better than traditional CCTA (AUCAI = 0.870, AUCCCTA = 0.781, P < 0.001). In identifying ≥ 50% stenotic vessels, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of CCTA-AI and traditional method are 86% and 83%, 88% and 59%, 85% and 94%, 73% and 84%, 94% and 83%, respectively. In the aspect of identifying plaque classification, accuracy of CCTA-AI is moderate compared to traditional CCTA (AUC = 0.750, P < 0.001). Conclusion: The proposed CCTA-AI allows the generation of auto-reconstructed CCTA images from a series of 2D CT images. This approach is relatively accurate for detecting ≥50% stenosis and analyzing plaque features compared to traditional CCTA."
32712190,An integrated architecture for intelligence evaluation of automated vehicles,Heye Huang,"Increasing automation calls for evaluating the effectiveness and intelligence of automated vehicles. This paper proposes a framework for quantitatively evaluating the intelligence of automated vehicles. Firstly, we establish the evaluation environment for automated vehicles including test field, test task, and evaluation index. The test tasks include the single vehicle decision-making (turning, lane-changing, overtaking, etc.) and the maneuver execution of multi-vehicle interaction (obstacle avoidance, trajectory optimization, etc.). The intelligence evaluation index is the action amount of driving process considering the safety, efficiency, rationality and comfort. Then, we calculate the actual action amount of the automated vehicle in different scenarios in the test field. Finally, the least action calculated theoretically corresponds to the highest intelligence degree of the automated vehicle, and is employed as a standard to quantify the performance of other tested automated vehicles. The effectiveness of this framework is verified with two naturalistic driving datasets that contain the normal driving scenarios and high-risk scenarios. Specifically, the naturalistic lane-changing data filters 40,416 frames and 179 similar lane-changing trajectories. Compared with the lane-changing behavior of a large number of drivers, experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve the intelligence degree of drivers in the lane change scenario. Meanwhile, in 253 reconstructed high-risk scenarios, the intelligent risk avoidance ability of the proposed intelligence degree evaluation algorithm can be verified by comparing with the driver behavior and TTC algorithm. These experimental results show that the proposed framework can effectively quantify intelligence and evaluate the performance of automated vehicles under various scenarios."
32711142,"Pituitary Tumors in the Computational Era, Exploring Novel Approaches to Diagnosis, and Outcome Prediction with Machine Learning",Sauson Soldozy,"Background: Machine learning has emerged as a viable asset in the setting of pituitary surgery. In the past decade, the number of machine learning models developed to aid in the diagnosis of pituitary lesions and predict intraoperative and postoperative complications following transsphenoidal surgery has increased exponentially. As computational processing power continues to increase, big data sets continue to expand, and learning algorithms continue to surpass gold standard predictive tools, machine learning will serve to become an important component in improving patient care and outcomes. Methods: Relevant studies were identified based on a literature search in PubMed and MEDLINE databases, as well as from other sources including reference lists of published articles. Results: Radiomics and artificial neural networks comprise the majority of machine learning-based applications in pituitary surgery. Radiomics serves to quantify specific imaging features, which can then be used to noninvasively identify tumor characteristics and make definitive diagnoses, circumventing presurgical biopsy altogether. Neural networks can be adapted to predict intraoperative changes in visual evoked potentials or cerebral spinal fluid leak. In addition, these algorithms may be combined with others to predict tumor aggressiveness, gross total resection, recurrence and remission, and even total cost burden. Conclusions: The field of machine learning is broad, with radiomics and artificial neural networks comprising 2 commonly used supervised learning methods in pituitary surgery. Given the large heterogeneity of pituitary and sellar lesions, the promise of machine learning lies in its ability to identify relationships and patterns that are otherwise hidden from standard statistical methods. While machine learning has great potential as a clinical adjunct during the surgical preplanning process and in predicting complications and outcomes, challenges moving forward include standardization and validation of these paradigms."
32710982,Highly Conserved Molecular Features in IgLONs Contrast Their Distinct Structural and Biological Outcomes,Harikanth Venkannagari,"Neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) and neurotrimin (NTM) are abundant cell-surface proteins found in the brain and form part of the IgLON (Immunoglobulin LSAMP, OBCAM, Neurotrimin) family. In humans, NEGR1 is implicated in obesity and mental disorders, while NTM is linked to intelligence and cognitive function. IgLONs dimerize homophilically and heterophilically, and they are thought to shape synaptic connections and neural circuits by acting in trans (spanning cellular junctions) and/or in cis (at the same side of a junction). Here, we reveal homodimeric structures of NEGR1 and NTM. They assemble into V-shaped complexes via their Ig1 domains, and disruption of the Ig1-Ig1 interface abolishes dimerization in solution. A hydrophobic ridge from one Ig1 domain inserts into a hydrophobic pocket from the opposing Ig1 domain producing an interaction interface that is highly conserved among IgLONs but remarkably plastic structurally. Given the high degree of sequence conservation at the interaction interface, we tested whether different IgLONs could elicit the same biological effect in vivo. In a small-scale study administering different soluble IgLONs directly into the brain and monitoring feeding, only NEGR1 altered food intake significantly. Taking NEGR1 as a prototype, our studies thus indicate that while IgLONs share a conserved mode of interaction and are able to bind each other as homomers and heteromers, they are structurally plastic and can exert unique biological action."
32710195,Surgery 4.0-are we ready?],D Teber,"The increasing networking of data systems in medicine is not only leading to modern interdisciplinarity in the sense of cooperation between different medical departments, but also poses new challenges regarding the building and room infrastructure. The surgical operating room of the future expands or augments its reality, away from the pure building characteristics, towards an intelligent and communicative space platform. The building infrastructure (operating theatre) serves as sensor and actuator. Thus, it is possible to inform about missing diagnostics as well as to register them directly in the contextualization of the planned surgical intervention or to integrate them into the processes. Integrated operating theatres represent a comprehensive computer platform based on a corresponding system architecture with software-based protocols. An underlying modular system consisting of various modules for image acquisition and analysis, interaction and visualization supports the integration and merging of heterogeneous data that are generated in a hospital operation. Integral building data (e.g., air conditioning, lighting control, device registration) are merged with patient-related data (age, type of illness, concomitant diseases, existing diagnostic CT and MRI images). New systems coming onto the market, as well as already existing systems will have to be measured by the extent to which they will be able to guarantee this integration of information-similar to the development from mobile phone to smartphone. Cost reduction should not be the only legitimizing argument for the market launch, but the vision of a new quality of surgical perception and action."
32710130,Role of artificial intelligence in assessing the extent and progression of dermatoses],L V Maul,"Background: In recent years, many medical specialties with a visual focus have been revolutionized by image analysis algorithms using artificial intelligence (AI). As dermatology belongs to this field, it has the potential to play a pioneering role in the use of AI. Objective: The current use of AI for the diagnosis and follow-up of dermatoses is reviewed and the future potential of these technologies is discussed. Materials and methods: This article is based on a selective review of the literature using Embase and MEDLINE and the keywords ""psoriasis"", ""eczema"", ""dermatoses"" and ""acne"" combined with ""artificial intelligence"", ""machine learning"", ""deep learning"", ""neural network"", ""computer-guided"", ""supervised machine learning"" or ""unsupervised machine learning"" were searched. Results: In comparison to examiner-dependent intra- and interindividually fluctuating scores for the assessment of inflammatory dermatoses (e.g. the Psoriasis Areas Severity Index [PASI] and body surface area [BSA]), AI-based algorithms can potentially offer reproducible, standardized evaluations of these scores. Whereas promising algorithms have already been developed for the diagnosis of psoriasis, there is currently only scarce work on the use of AI in the context of eczema. Conclusions: The latest developments in this field show the enormous potential of AI-based diagnostics and follow-up of dermatological clinical pictures by means of an autonomous computer-based image analysis. These noninvasive, optical examination methods provide valuable additional information, but dermatological interaction remains indispensable in daily clinical practice."
32709998,Digital health technologies: opportunities and challenges in rheumatology,Daniel H Solomon,"The past decade in rheumatology has seen tremendous innovation in digital health technologies, including the electronic health record, virtual visits, mobile health, wearable technology, digital therapeutics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. The increased availability of these technologies offers opportunities for improving important aspects of rheumatology, including access, outcomes, adherence and research. However, despite its growth in some areas, particularly with non-health-care consumers, digital health technology has not substantially changed the delivery of rheumatology care. This Review discusses key barriers and opportunities to improve application of digital health technologies in rheumatology. Key topics include smart design, voice enablement and the integration of electronic patient-reported outcomes. Smart design involves active engagement with the end users of the technologies, including patients and clinicians through focus groups, user testing sessions and prototype review. Voice enablement using voice assistants could be critical for enabling patients with hand arthritis to effectively use smartphone apps and might facilitate patient engagement with many technologies. Tracking many rheumatic diseases requires frequent monitoring of patient-reported outcomes. Current practice only collects this information sporadically, and rarely between visits. Digital health technology could enable patient-reported outcomes to inform appropriate timing of face-to-face visits and enable improved application of treat-to-target strategies. However, best practice standards for digital health technologies do not yet exist. To achieve the potential of digital health technology in rheumatology, rheumatology professionals will need to be more engaged upstream in the technology design process and provide leadership to effectively incorporate the new tools into clinical care."
32709958,Refractive surgery beyond 2020,Marcus Ang,"Refractive surgery refers to any procedure that corrects or minimizes refractive errors. Today, refractive surgery has evolved beyond the traditional laser refractive surgery, embodied by the popular laser in situ keratomileusis or 'LASIK'. New keratorefractive techniques such as small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) avoids corneal flap creation and uses a single laser device, while advances in surface ablation techniques have seen a resurgence in its popularity. Presbyopic treatment options have also expanded to include new ablation profiles, intracorneal implants, and phakic intraocular implants. With the improved safety and efficacy of refractive lens exchange, a wider variety of intraocular lens implants with advanced optics provide more options for refractive correction in carefully selected patients. In this review, we also discuss possible developments in refractive surgery beyond 2020, such as preoperative evaluation of refractive patients using machine learning and artificial intelligence, potential use of stromal lenticules harvested from SMILE for presbyopic treatments, and various advances in intraocular lens implants that may provide a closer to 'physiological correction' of refractive errors."
32709849,Programmable electronic synapse and nonvolatile resistive switches using MoS2 quantum dots,Anna Thomas,"Brain-inspired computation that mimics the coordinated functioning of neural networks through multitudes of synaptic connections is deemed to be the future of computation to overcome the classical von Neumann bottleneck. The future artificial intelligence circuits require scalable electronic synapse (e-synapses) with very high bit densities and operational speeds. In this respect, nanostructures of two-dimensional materials serve the purpose and offer the scalability of the devices in lateral and vertical dimensions. In this work, we report the nonvolatile bipolar resistive switching and neuromorphic behavior of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) quantum dots (QD) synthesized using liquid-phase exfoliation method. The ReRAM devices exhibit good resistive switching with an On-Off ratio of 104, with excellent endurance and data retention at a smaller read voltage as compared to the existing MoS2 based memory devices. Besides, we have demonstrated the e-synapse based on MoS2 QD. Similar to our biological synapse, Paired Pulse Facilitation / Depression of short-term memory has been observed in these MoS2 QD based e-synapse devices. This work suggests that MoS2 QD has potential applications in ultra-high-density storage as well as artificial intelligence circuitry in a cost-effective way."
32709639,Blood pressure and cognitive function across the eighth decade: a prospective study of the Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936,Drew Altschul,"Objectives: We investigated the associations among blood pressure and cognitive functions across the eighth decade, while accounting for antihypertensive medication and lifetime stability in cognitive function. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: This study used data from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) study, which recruited participants living in the Lothian region of Scotland when aged 70 years, most of whom had completed an intelligence test at age 11 years. Participants: 1091 members of the LBC1936 with assessments of cognitive ability in childhood and older adulthood, and blood pressure measurements in older adulthood. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Participants were followed up at ages 70, 73, 76 and 79, and latent growth curve models and linear mixed models were used to analyse both cognitive functions and blood pressure as primary outcomes. Results: Blood pressure followed a quadratic trajectory in the eighth decade: on average blood pressure rose in the first waves and subsequently fell. Intercepts and trajectories were not associated between blood pressure and cognitive functions. Women with higher early-life cognitive function generally had lower blood pressure during the eighth decade. Being prescribed antihypertensive medication was associated with lower blood pressure, but not with better cognitive function. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that women with higher early-life cognitive function had lower later-life blood pressure. However, we did not find support for the hypothesis that rises in blood pressure and worse cognitive decline are associated with one another in the eighth decade."
32709212,Obstructive Sleep Apnea Risk Is Associated with Cognitive Impairment after Controlling for Mild Traumatic Brain Injury History: A Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium Study,Amanda Garcia,"The contribution of sleep disturbance to persistent cognitive symptoms following a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) remains unclear. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is very common, yet its relationship between risk factors for developing OSA and cognitive performance in those with history of mTBI has not been investigated. The current study examined OSA risk levels and its association with cognitive performance in 391 combat-exposed, post-911 veterans and service members (median age = 37 years) enrolled in the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC) prospective multi-center study. Participants included those with and without mTBI (n = 326 and 65, respectively). When using clinical cut-offs, those with history of mTBI were more likely to be categorized as high risk for OSA (mTBI positive = 65% vs. mTBI negative = 51%). After adjustment for TBI status and demographic variables, increased OSA risk was significantly associated with worse performance on measures of complex processing speed and executive functioning (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Fourth Edition Coding, Trail Making Test, part B) and greater symptom burden (Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory). Thus, OSA, a modifiable behavioral health factor, likely contributes to cognitive performance following mTBI. Accordingly, OSA serves as a potential point of intervention to improve clinical and cognitive outcomes after injury."
32709156,Internet of Beer: A Review on Smart Technologies from Mash to Pint,Simona Violino,"The beer production chain includes some crucial steps regarding processing, delivery, service, and consumption that can benefit from the implementation of IoT (Internet of Things) based technologies. Large breweries implemented the use of sensors and digitization before smaller ones among which are craft breweries. Internet of Beer (IoB) technologies are becoming accessible to mid and small sized brewing companies. Therefore, the objective of this work is to review mainly low-cost IoB smart technologies that can be implemented from the mash to the final product and its service, to improve the brewing production, control, delivery, and final quality increasing profitability. The reviewed applications were retrieved both from the scientific databases and from the web. The work is structured in three macro areas such as beer processing, product logistics and traceability, and service. The results show a future trend characterized by a very fast increase in the use of IoB (also open source) systems to drive efficiency, productivity, quality, and safety. This will be done by real-time monitoring and a data-driven decision support system (DSS). Crucial aspects needing further investigation are data ownership and data standardization. The access price of IoB devices and software is destined for a significant decrease while their diversification on the market will grow leading to a massive future implementation within all the production levels."
32709121,Machine Learning Approach to Forecast Chemotherapy-Induced Haematological Toxicities in Patients with Rhabdomyosarcoma,Vesna Cuplov,"Developing precision medicine is a major trend in clinical oncology. The main adverse effects of ifosfamide, actinomycin D and vincristine (IVA) treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma are haematological toxicities such as neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. The severity of these effects vary among patients but their dynamic profiles are similar. A non-empirical adjustment of the chemotherapy dose to avoid severe toxicities could help secure the treatment administration. Twenty-four patients with rhabdomyosarcoma treated with IVA chemotherapy courses were selected. Before and during each cycle, routine multiple blood cell counts were performed allowing for a dynamic study of the haematological toxicities. We developed a machine learning analysis using a gradient boosting regression technique to forecast the ifosfamide induced haematological toxicities as a function of neutrophils and platelets initial levels and the initial ifosfamide dose. To validate models' accuracy, predicted and observed neutrophils and platelets levels were compared. The model was able to reproduce the dynamic profiles of the haematological toxicities. Among all cycles, the mean absolute errors between predicted and observed neutrophils and platelets levels were 1.0 and 72.8 G/L, respectively. Adjusting a patient's ifosfamide dose based upon the predicted haematological toxicity levels at the end of a treatment cycle could enable tailored treatment."
32708785,"Relevant Applications of Generative Adversarial Networks in Drug Design and Discovery: Molecular De Novo Design, Dimensionality Reduction, and De Novo Peptide and Protein Design",Eugene Lin,"A growing body of evidence now suggests that artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques can serve as an indispensable foundation for the process of drug design and discovery. In light of latest advancements in computing technologies, deep learning algorithms are being created during the development of clinically useful drugs for treatment of a number of diseases. In this review, we focus on the latest developments for three particular arenas in drug design and discovery research using deep learning approaches, such as generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks. Firstly, we review drug design and discovery studies that leverage various GAN techniques to assess one main application such as molecular de novo design in drug design and discovery. In addition, we describe various GAN models to fulfill the dimension reduction task of single-cell data in the preclinical stage of the drug development pipeline. Furthermore, we depict several studies in de novo peptide and protein design using GAN frameworks. Moreover, we outline the limitations in regard to the previous drug design and discovery studies using GAN models. Finally, we present a discussion of directions and challenges for future research."
32708496,Designing a Cyber-Physical System for Ambient Assisted Living: A Use-Case Analysis for Social Robot Navigation in Caregiving Centers,Luis V Calderita,"The advances of the Internet of Things, robotics, and Artificial Intelligence, to give just a few examples, allow us to imagine promising results in the development of smart buildings in the near future. In the particular case of elderly care, there are new solutions that integrate systems that monitor variables associated with the health of each user or systems that facilitate physical or cognitive rehabilitation. In all these solutions, it is clear that these new environments, usually called Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), configure a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) that connects information from the physical world to the cyber-world with the primary objective of adding more intelligence to these environments. This article presents a CPS-AAL for caregiving centers, with the main novelty that includes a Socially Assistive Robot (SAR). The CPS-AAL presented in this work uses a digital twin world with the information acquired by all devices. The basis of this digital twin world is the CORTEX cognitive architecture, a set of software agents interacting through a Deep State Representation (DSR) that stored the shared information between them. The proposal is evaluated in a simulated environment with two use cases requiring interaction between the sensors and the SAR in a simulated caregiving center."
32708429,Classification of Microarray Gene Expression Data Using an Infiltration Tactics Optimization (ITO) Algorithm,Javed Zahoor,"A number of different feature selection and classification techniques have been proposed in literature including parameter-free and parameter-based algorithms. The former are quick but may result in local maxima while the latter use dataset-specific parameter-tuning for higher accuracy. However, higher accuracy may not necessarily mean higher reliability of the model. Thus, generalized optimization is still a challenge open for further research. This paper presents a warzone inspired ""infiltration tactics"" based optimization algorithm (ITO)-not to be confused with the ITO algorithm based on the Itõ Process in the field of Stochastic calculus. The proposed ITO algorithm combines parameter-free and parameter-based classifiers to produce a high-accuracy-high-reliability (HAHR) binary classifier. The algorithm produces results in two phases: (i) Lightweight Infantry Group (LIG) converges quickly to find non-local maxima and produces comparable results (i.e., 70 to 88% accuracy) (ii) Followup Team (FT) uses advanced tuning to enhance the baseline performance (i.e., 75 to 99%). Every soldier of the ITO army is a base model with its own independently chosen Subset selection method, pre-processing, and validation methods and classifier. The successful soldiers are combined through heterogeneous ensembles for optimal results. The proposed approach addresses a data scarcity problem, is flexible to the choice of heterogeneous base classifiers, and is able to produce HAHR models comparable to the established MAQC-II results."
32708355,Predicting Old-age Mortality Using Principal Component Analysis: Results from a National Panel Survey in Korea,Jaeyong Shin,"Background and Objectives: This study aimed to group diseases classified by the International Classification of Diseases using principal component analysis, and discuss a systematic approach to reducing the preventable death rate from a perspective of public health. Materials and Methods: Using a 10-year follow-up analysis of the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) data, this study obtained de-identified data including participants' data of community-dwelling individuals aged ≥45 years from 2006 to 2016. Participants were randomly selected using a multistage, stratified probability sampling based on geographical area and housing type. We excluded 37 participants with missing information at baseline and included 10,217 study participants. This study used the principal component analysis to extract comorbidity patterns, and chi-square test and Cox proportional hazards models for analyzing the association between the factors of interest. Results: Principal component 1 (diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension) was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of 1.079 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.031-1.129, p = 0.001). Principal component 3 (psychiatric and cerebrovascular diseases) was related to an increased HR of 1.134 (95% CI 1.094-1.175, p < 0.0001). Moreover, principal component 4 was associated with a high HR of 1.172 (95% CI 1.130-1.215, p < 0.0001). However, among participants aged between 45 and 64 years, principal component 4 showed a meaningfully increased HR of 1.262 (95% CI 1.184-1.346, p < 0.001). In this study, among the four principal components, three were statistically associated with increased mortality. Conclusions: The principal component analysis for predicting mortality may become a useful tool, and artificial intelligence (AI) will improve a value-based healthcare strategy, along with developing a clinical decision support model."
32708343,The Impact of Artificial Intelligence in the Endoscopic Assessment of Premalignant and Malignant Esophageal Lesions: Present and Future,Daniela Cornelia Lazăr,"In the gastroenterology field, the impact of artificial intelligence was investigated for the purposes of diagnostics, risk stratification of patients, improvement in quality of endoscopic procedures and early detection of neoplastic diseases, implementation of the best treatment strategy, and optimization of patient prognosis. Computer-assisted diagnostic systems to evaluate upper endoscopy images have recently emerged as a supporting tool in endoscopy due to the risks of misdiagnosis related to standard endoscopy and different expertise levels of endoscopists, time-consuming procedures, lack of availability of advanced procedures, increasing workloads, and development of endoscopic mass screening programs. Recent research has tended toward computerized, automatic, and real-time detection of lesions, which are approaches that offer utility in daily practice. Despite promising results, certain studies might overexaggerate the diagnostic accuracy of artificial systems, and several limitations remain to be overcome in the future. Therefore, additional multicenter randomized trials and the development of existent database platforms are needed to certify clinical implementation. This paper presents an overview of the literature and the current knowledge of the usefulness of different types of machine learning systems in the assessment of premalignant and malignant esophageal lesions via conventional and advanced endoscopic procedures. This study makes a presentation of the artificial intelligence terminology and refers also to the most prominent recent research on computer-assisted diagnosis of neoplasia on Barrett's esophagus and early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and prediction of invasion depth in esophageal neoplasms. Furthermore, this review highlights the main directions of future doctor-computer collaborations in which machines are expected to improve the quality of medical action and routine clinical workflow, thus reducing the burden on physicians."
32708295,Artificial Intelligence Methods for Constructing Wine Barrels with a Controlled Oxygen Transmission Rate,Víctor Martínez-Martínez,"Oxygen is an important factor in the wine aging process, and the oxygen transmission rate (OTR) is the parameter of the wood that reflects its oxygen permeation. OTR has not been considered in the cooperage industry yet; however, recent studies proposed a nondestructive method for estimating the OTR of barrel staves, but an efficient method to combine these staves to build barrels with a desired OTR is needed to implement it in the industry. This article proposes artificial intelligence methods for selecting staves for the construction of barrel heads or bodies with a desired target OTR. Genetic algorithms were used to implement these methods in consideration of the known OTR of the staves and the geometry of the wine barrels. The proposed methods were evaluated in several scenarios: homogenizing the OTR of the actual constructed barrels, constructing low-OTR and high-OTR barrels based on a preclassification of the staves and implementing the proposed method in real cooperage conditions. The results of these experiments suggest the suitability of the proposed methods for their implementation in a cooperage in order to build controlled OTR barrels."
32708152,FedMed: A Federated Learning Framework for Language Modeling,Xing Wu,"Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving technique for training a vast amount of decentralized data and making inferences on mobile devices. As a typical language modeling problem, mobile keyboard prediction aims at suggesting a probable next word or phrase and facilitating the human-machine interaction in a virtual keyboard of the smartphone or laptop. Mobile keyboard prediction with FL hopes to satisfy the growing demand that high-level data privacy be preserved in artificial intelligence applications even with the distributed models training. However, there are two major problems in the federated optimization for the prediction: (1) aggregating model parameters on the server-side and (2) reducing communication costs caused by model weights collection. To address the above issues, traditional FL methods simply use averaging aggregation or ignore communication costs. We propose a novel Federated Mediation (FedMed) framework with the adaptive aggregation, mediation incentive scheme, and topK strategy to address the model aggregation and communication costs. The performance is evaluated in terms of perplexity and communication rounds. Experiments are conducted on three datasets (i.e., Penn Treebank, WikiText-2, and Yelp) and the results demonstrate that our FedMed framework achieves robust performance and outperforms baseline approaches."
32708135,An On-Device Deep Learning Approach to Battery Saving on Industrial Mobile Terminals,Inyeop Choi,"The mobile terminals used in the logistics industry can be exposed to wildly varying environments, which may hinder effective operation. In particular, those used in cold storages can be subject to frosting in the scanner window when they are carried out of the warehouses to a room-temperature space outside. To prevent this, they usually employ a film heater on the scanner window. However, the temperature and humidity conditions of the surrounding environment and the temperature of the terminal itself that cause frosting vary widely. Due to the complicated frost-forming conditions, existing industrial mobile terminals choose to implement rather simple rules that operate the film heater well above the freezing point, which inevitably leads to inefficient energy use. This paper demonstrates that to avoid such waste, on-device artificial intelligence (AI) a.k.a. edge AI can be readily employed to industrial mobile terminals and can improve their energy efficiency. We propose an artificial-intelligence-based approach that utilizes deep learning technology to avoid the energy-wasting defrosting operations. By combining the traditional temperature-sensing logic with a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier that visually checks for frost, we can more precisely control the defrosting operation. We embed the CNN classifier in the device and demonstrate that the approach significantly reduces the energy consumption. On our test terminal, the net ratio of the energy consumption by the existing system to that of the edge AI for the heating film is almost 14:1. Even with the common current-dissipation accounted for, our edge AI system would increase the operating hours by 86%, or by more than 6 h compared with the system without the edge AI."
32707846,Predictors of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Risks,Stephen J Haller,"Computational biomechanics via finite element analysis (FEA) has long promised a means of assessing patient-specific abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture risk with greater efficacy than current clinically used size-based criteria. The pursuit stems from the notion that AAA rupture occurs when wall stress exceeds wall strength. Quantification of peak (maximum) wall stress (PWS) has been at the cornerstone of this research, with numerous studies having demonstrated that PWS better differentiates ruptured AAAs from non-ruptured AAAs. In contrast to wall stress models, which have become progressively more sophisticated, there has been relatively little progress in estimating patient-specific wall strength. This is because wall strength cannot be inferred non-invasively, and measurements from excised patient tissues show a large spectrum of wall strength values. In this review, we highlight studies that investigated the relationship between biomechanics and AAA rupture risk. We conclude that combining wall stress and wall strength approximations should provide better estimations of AAA rupture risk. However, before personalized biomechanical AAA risk assessment can become a reality, better methods for estimating patient-specific wall properties or surrogate markers of aortic wall degradation are needed. Artificial intelligence methods can be key in stratifying patients, leading to personalized AAA risk assessment."
32707839,Biological and Medical Importance of Cellular Heterogeneity Deciphered by Single-Cell RNA Sequencing,Rishikesh Kumar Gupta,"The present review discusses recent progress in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), which can describe cellular heterogeneity in various organs, bodily fluids, and pathologies (e.g., cancer and Alzheimer's disease). We outline scRNA-seq techniques that are suitable for investigating cellular heterogeneity that is present in cell populations with very high resolution of the transcriptomic landscape. We summarize scRNA-seq findings and applications of this technology to identify cell types, activity, and other features that are important for the function of different bodily organs. We discuss future directions for scRNA-seq techniques that can link gene expression, protein expression, cellular function, and their roles in pathology. We speculate on how the field could develop beyond its present limitations (e.g., performing scRNA-seq in situ and in vivo). Finally, we discuss the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence with cutting-edge scRNA-seq technology, which could provide a strong basis for designing precision medicine and targeted therapy in the future."
32707832,"Mastitis While Breastfeeding: Prevention, the Importance of Proper Treatment, and Potential Complications",Miri Pevzner,"Mastitis is an inflammation in the breast, which may involve a bacterial infection. Breast infection during breastfeeding is a common phenomenon that requires immediate and appropriate treatment. Without proper treatment, inflammation may lead to the cessation of breastfeeding. Another potential complication is the development of an abscess. Based on the nutritional and immunological value of breast milk, the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) is exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months of age, followed by continued breastfeeding as complementary foods are introduced, with continuation of breastfeeding for 1 year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infanRecent meta-analyses indicate breastfeeding protects against childhood infections, allows for a possible increase in intelligence, and for a reduction in overweight and diabetes. Breastfeeding is beneficial for nursing women as well. It is therefore important to help the mother overcome difficulties such as mastitis and to continue breastfeeding. The choice of a proper treatment and the provision of therapeutic instructions to the patient are crucial for a cure, for a successful duration of breastfeeding, and for preventing complications for mother and baby. In this article, we provide the latest clinical guidelines regarding drug treatment and supportive therapy in mastitis. We also discuss the latest guidelines of candida treatment, as candida infection may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Overall, improperly treated mastitis may cause the premature cessation of breastfeeding, and will cause suffering to both mother and baby; giving proper treatment and instructions to the mother are hence of the utmost importance."
32707823,User Experience Sensor for Man-Machine Interaction Modeled as an Analogy to the Tower of Hanoi,Arkadiusz Gardecki,"This paper presents a novel user experience optimization concept and method, named User Experience Sensor, applied within the Hybrid Intelligence System (HINT). The HINT system, defined as a combination of an extensive AI system and the possibility of attaching a human expert, is designed to be used by relational agents, which may have a physical form, such as a robot, a kiosk, be embodied in an avatar, or may also exist as only software. The proposed method focuses on automatic process evaluation as a common sensor for optimization of the user experience for every process stage and the indicator for human-expert automatic session activation. This functionality is realized by the User Experience Sensor, which constitutes one of main elements of the self-optimizing interaction system. The authors present the optimization mechanism of the HINT system as an analogy to the process of building a Tower of Hanoi. The proposed sensor evaluates the user experience and measures the user/employee efficiency at every stage of a given process, offering the user to choose other forms of information, interaction, or expert support. The designed HINT system is able to learn and self-optimize, making the entire process more intuitive and easy for each and every user individually. The HINT system with the proposed sensor, implemented in a window assembly facility, successfully reduced assembly time, increased employees' satisfaction, and assembly quality. The proposed approach can be implemented in numerous man-machine interaction applications."
36204092,A model to strengthen utility of quality pharmaceutical health systems data in resource-limited settings,Harriet Rachel Kagoya,"Background: Limited utility of quality health data undermines efforts to strengthen healthcare delivery, particularly in resource-limited settings. Few studies model the effective utility of quality pharmaceutical information system (PIS) data in sub-Saharan Africa, typified with weak health systems. Aim: To develop a model and guidelines for strengthening utility of quality PIS data in public healthcare in Namibia, a resource-limited setting. Methods: A qualitative model based on Dickoff et al. practice-oriented theory, Chinn and Jacobs' systematic approach to theory, and applied consensus techniques. Data from nationwide studies on quality and utility of PIS data in public healthcare conducted between 2018 and March 2020 informed the development of the model concepts. Pharmaceutical and public health systems experts validated the final model. Results: Overall, four preliminary national studies that recruited 58 PIS focal persons at 38 public health facilities and national level informed the development of four model concepts. The model describes concepts on access, management, dissemination, and utility of quality PIS data. Activities to implement the model in practice include grass-root integration of real-time automated pharmaceutical intelligence systems to collect, consolidate, monitor, and report PIS data. Strengthening coordination, human resources, and technical capacity through support supervisory systems at grass-root facilities are key activities. PIS focal persons at health facility and national level are agents to implement these activities among recipients, that is, healthcare professionals at points of care. Guidelines for implementation of the model at point of care are included. Experts described the model as clear, simple, comprehensive, and integration of pharmaceutical intelligence systems at point of care as novel and of importance to enhance utility of quality PIS data in resource-limited settings. Conclusion: While utility of quality PIS data is limited in Namibia, advantages of the model are encouraging, toward building resilient pharmaceutical intelligence systems at grass roots in resource-limited countries, where there are not only weak health systems, but high burden of misuse of medicines."
32706893,Artificial intelligence-based morphological fingerprinting of megakaryocytes: a new tool for assessing disease in MPN patients,Korsuk Sirinukunwattana,"Accurate diagnosis and classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) requires integration of clinical, morphological, and genetic findings. Despite major advances in our understanding of the molecular and genetic basis of MPNs, the morphological assessment of bone marrow trephines (BMT) is critical in differentiating MPN subtypes and their reactive mimics. However, morphological assessment is heavily constrained by a reliance on subjective, qualitative, and poorly reproducible criteria. To improve the morphological assessment of MPNs, we have developed a machine learning approach for the automated identification, quantitative analysis, and abstract representation of megakaryocyte features using reactive/nonneoplastic BMT samples (n = 43) and those from patients with established diagnoses of essential thrombocythemia (n = 45), polycythemia vera (n = 18), or myelofibrosis (n = 25). We describe the application of an automated workflow for the identification and delineation of relevant histological features from routinely prepared BMTs. Subsequent analysis enabled the tissue diagnosis of MPN with a high predictive accuracy (area under the curve = 0.95) and revealed clear evidence of the potential to discriminate between important MPN subtypes. Our method of visually representing abstracted megakaryocyte features in the context of analyzed patient cohorts facilitates the interpretation and monitoring of samples in a manner that is beyond conventional approaches. The automated BMT phenotyping approach described here has significant potential as an adjunct to standard genetic and molecular testing in established or suspected MPN patients, either as part of the routine diagnostic pathway or in the assessment of disease progression/response to treatment."
32706819,Quantitative lung lesion features and temporal changes on chest CT in patients with common and severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia,Yue Zhang,"The purpose of this study was to describe the temporal evolution of quantitative lung lesion features on chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with common and severe types of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. Records of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were reviewed retrospectively from 24 January 2020 to 15 March 2020. Patients were classified into common and severe groups according to the diagnostic criteria of severe pneumonia. The quantitative CT features of lung lesions were automatically calculated using artificial intelligence algorithms, and the percentages of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV), consolidation volume (PCV) and total lesion volume (PTV) were determined in both lungs. PGV, PCV and PTV were analyzed based on the time from the onset of initial symptoms in the common and severe groups. In the common group, PTV increased slowly and peaked at approximately 12 days from the onset of the initial symptoms. In the severe group, PTV peaked at approximately 17 days. The severe pneumonia group exhibited increased PGV, PCV and PTV compared with the common group. These features started to appear in Stage 2 (4-7 days from onset of initial symptoms) and were observed in all subsequent stages (p<0.05). In severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients, PGV, PCV and PTV began to significantly increase in Stage 2 and decrease in Stage 5 (22-30 days). Compared with common SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients, the patients in the severe group exhibited increased PGV, PCV and PTV as well as a later peak time of lesion and recovery time."
32706688,Role of Artificial Intelligence in Patient Safety Outcomes: Systematic Literature Review,Avishek Choudhury,"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) provides opportunities to identify the health risks of patients and thus influence patient safety outcomes. Objective: The purpose of this systematic literature review was to identify and analyze quantitative studies utilizing or integrating AI to address and report clinical-level patient safety outcomes. Methods: We restricted our search to the PubMed, PubMed Central, and Web of Science databases to retrieve research articles published in English between January 2009 and August 2019. We focused on quantitative studies that reported positive, negative, or intermediate changes in patient safety outcomes using AI apps, specifically those based on machine-learning algorithms and natural language processing. Quantitative studies reporting only AI performance but not its influence on patient safety outcomes were excluded from further review. Results: We identified 53 eligible studies, which were summarized concerning their patient safety subcategories, the most frequently used AI, and reported performance metrics. Recognized safety subcategories were clinical alarms (n=9; mainly based on decision tree models), clinical reports (n=21; based on support vector machine models), and drug safety (n=23; mainly based on decision tree models). Analysis of these 53 studies also identified two essential findings: (1) the lack of a standardized benchmark and (2) heterogeneity in AI reporting. Conclusions: This systematic review indicates that AI-enabled decision support systems, when implemented correctly, can aid in enhancing patient safety by improving error detection, patient stratification, and drug management. Future work is still needed for robust validation of these systems in prospective and real-world clinical environments to understand how well AI can predict safety outcomes in health care settings."
32706670,Reinforcement Learning for Clinical Decision Support in Critical Care: Comprehensive Review,Siqi Liu,"Background: Decision support systems based on reinforcement learning (RL) have been implemented to facilitate the delivery of personalized care. This paper aimed to provide a comprehensive review of RL applications in the critical care setting. Objective: This review aimed to survey the literature on RL applications for clinical decision support in critical care and to provide insight into the challenges of applying various RL models. Methods: We performed an extensive search of the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE). Studies published over the past 10 years (2010-2019) that have applied RL for critical care were included. Results: We included 21 papers and found that RL has been used to optimize the choice of medications, drug dosing, and timing of interventions and to target personalized laboratory values. We further compared and contrasted the design of the RL models and the evaluation metrics for each application. Conclusions: RL has great potential for enhancing decision making in critical care. Challenges regarding RL system design, evaluation metrics, and model choice exist. More importantly, further work is required to validate RL in authentic clinical environments."
32706086,Artificial intelligence: a disruptive tool for a smarter medicine,C M Galmarini,"Objective: Although highly successful, the medical R&D model is failing at improving people's health due to a series of flaws and defects inherent to the model itself. A new collective intelligence, incorporating human and artificial intelligence (AI) could overcome these obstacles. Because AI will play a key role in this new collective intelligence, it is necessary that those involved in healthcare have a general knowledge of how these technologies work. With this comprehensive review, we intend to provide it. Materials and methods: A broad-ranging search has been undertaken on institutional and non-institutional websites in order to identify relevant papers, comments and reports. Results: We firstly describe the flaws and defects of the current R&D biomedical model and how the generation of a new collective intelligence will result in a better and wiser medicine through a truly personalized and holistic approach. We, then, discuss the new forms of data collection and data processing and the different types of artificial learning and their specific algorithms. Finally, we review the current uses and applications of AI in the biomedical field and how these can be expanded, as well as the limitations and challenges of applying these new technologies in the medical field. Conclusions: This colossal common effort based on a new collective intelligence will exponentially improve the quality of medical research, resulting in a radical change for the better in the healthcare model. AI, without replacing us, is here to help us achieve the ambitious goal set by the WHO in the Alma Ata declaration of 1978: ""Health for All""."
32705560,Application of artificial neural networks to predict the heavy metal contamination in the Bartin River,Handan Ucun Ozel,"In this study, copper (Cu), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb) analyses were performed, and the results were modelled by artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Samples were taken from 3 stations selected on the Bartin River for 1 year between December 2012 and December 2013. Radial basis neural network (RBANN), multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks models, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were applied to the data in order to predict the heavy metal concentrations. As a result of the study, the RMSE and MAE values of all the heavy metal models were found to have very low error values during the test phase, and it was found that the models created using MLP had R2 values higher than 0.77 during the test phase; the test phase R2 values of the models using RBN method were found to be ranging between 0.773 and 0.989, and the test phase R2 value of the ANFIS model was higher than 0.80. If sorted from the best model to the worst by taking the MAE and RMSE values into consideration based on the test evaluation results, according to the heavy metal types, where all of the MLP, RBN, and ANFIS models were generally approximate to each other, RBN was successful for Cu, Zn, and Mn, while MLP model was successful for Ni and ANFIS model for Fe and Pb. According to the results, it can be inferred that the heavy metal contents can be estimated approximately with artificial intelligence models and relatively easy-to-measure parameters; it will be possible to detect heavy metals which are harmful to the viability of the rivers, both quickly and economically."

32704450,Predicting the effect of variants on splicing using Convolutional Neural Networks,Thanyathorn Thanapattheerakul,"Mutations that cause an error in the splicing of a messenger RNA (mRNA) can lead to diseases in humans. Various computational models have been developed to recognize the sequence pattern of the splice sites. In recent studies, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures were shown to outperform other existing models in predicting the splice sites. However, an insufficient effort has been put into extending the CNN model to predict the effect of the genomic variants on the splicing of mRNAs. This study proposes a framework to elaborate on the utility of CNNs to assess the effect of splice variants on the identification of potential disease-causing variants that disrupt the RNA splicing process. Five models, including three CNN-based and two non-CNN machine learning based, were trained and compared using two existing splice site datasets, Genome Wide Human splice sites (GWH) and a dataset provided at the Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence winter school 2018 (DLAI). The donor sites were also used to test on the HSplice tool to evaluate the predictive models. To improve the effectiveness of predictive models, two datasets were combined. The CNN model with four convolutional layers showed the best splice site prediction performance with an AUPRC of 93.4% and 88.8% for donor and acceptor sites, respectively. The effects of variants on splicing were estimated by applying the best model on variant data from the ClinVar database. Based on the estimation, the framework could effectively differentiate pathogenic variants from the benign variants (p = 5.9 × 10-7). These promising results support that the proposed framework could be applied in future genetic studies to identify disease causing loci involving the splicing mechanism. The datasets and Python scripts used in this study are available on the GitHub repository at https://github.com/smiile8888/rna-splice-sites-recognition."

32704419,Applications of Artificial Intelligence to Electronic Health Record Data in Ophthalmology,Wei-Chun Lin,"Widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has resulted in the collection of massive amounts of clinical data. In ophthalmology in particular, the volume range of data captured in EHR systems has been growing rapidly. Yet making effective secondary use of this EHR data for improving patient care and facilitating clinical decision-making has remained challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of these data. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques present a promising way to analyze these multimodal data sets. While AI techniques have been extensively applied to imaging data, there are a limited number of studies employing AI techniques with clinical data from the EHR. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of different AI methods applied to EHR data in the field of ophthalmology. This literature review highlights that the secondary use of EHR data has focused on glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts with the use of AI techniques. These techniques have been used to improve ocular disease diagnosis, risk assessment, and progression prediction. Techniques such as supervised machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing were most commonly used in the articles reviewed."
32704417,Methodological Challenges of Deep Learning in Optical Coherence Tomography for Retinal Diseases: A Review,Ryan T Yanagihara,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated classification and segmentation of optical coherence tomography (OCT) features have become increasingly popular. However, its 3-dimensional volumetric nature has made developing an algorithm that generalizes across all patient populations and OCT devices challenging. Several recent studies have reported high diagnostic performances of AI models; however, significant methodological challenges still exist in applying these models in real-world clinical practice. Lack of large-image datasets from multiple OCT devices, nonstandardized imaging or post-processing protocols between devices, limited graphics processing unit capabilities for exploiting 3-dimensional features, and inconsistency in the reporting metrics are major hurdles in enabling AI for OCT analyses. We discuss these issues and present possible solutions."
32704414,Explainable Machine Learning Approach as a Tool to Understand Factors Used to Select the Refractive Surgery Technique on the Expert Level,Tae Keun Yoo,"Purpose: Recently, laser refractive surgery options, including laser epithelial keratomileusis, laser in situ keratomileusis, and small incision lenticule extraction, successfully improved patients' quality of life. Evidence-based recommendation for an optimal surgery technique is valuable in increasing patient satisfaction. We developed an interpretable multiclass machine learning model that selects the laser surgery option on the expert level. Methods: A multiclass XGBoost model was constructed to classify patients into four categories including laser epithelial keratomileusis, laser in situ keratomileusis, small incision lenticule extraction, and contraindication groups. The analysis included 18,480 subjects who intended to undergo refractive surgery at the B&VIIT Eye center. Training (n = 10,561) and internal validation (n = 2640) were performed using subjects who visited between 2016 and 2017. The model was trained based on clinical decisions of highly experienced experts and ophthalmic measurements. External validation (n = 5279) was conducted using subjects who visited in 2018. The SHapley Additive ex-Planations technique was adopted to explain the output of the XGBoost model. Results: The multiclass XGBoost model exhibited an accuracy of 81.0% and 78.9% when tested on the internal and external validation datasets, respectively. The SHapley Additive ex-Planations explanations for the results were consistent with prior knowledge from ophthalmologists. The explanation from one-versus-one and one-versus-rest XGBoost classifiers was effective for easily understanding users in the multicategorical classification problem. Conclusions: This study suggests an expert-level multiclass machine learning model for selecting the refractive surgery for patients. It also provided a clinical understanding in a multiclass problem based on an explainable artificial intelligence technique. Translational relevance: Explainable machine learning exhibits a promising future for increasing the practical use of artificial intelligence in ophthalmic clinics."
32704413,A Clinician's Guide to Artificial Intelligence: How to Critically Appraise Machine Learning Studies,Livia Faes,"In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the prospect of machine learning models demonstrating expert-level diagnosis in multiple disease contexts. However, there is concern that the excitement around this field may be associated with inadequate scrutiny of methodology and insufficient adoption of scientific good practice in the studies involving artificial intelligence in health care. This article aims to empower clinicians and researchers to critically appraise studies of clinical applications of machine learning, through: (1) introducing basic machine learning concepts and nomenclature; (2) outlining key applicable principles of evidence-based medicine; and (3) highlighting some of the potential pitfalls in the design and reporting of these studies."
32704412,Insights into Systemic Disease through Retinal Imaging-Based Oculomics,Siegfried K Wagner,"Among the most noteworthy developments in ophthalmology over the last decade has been the emergence of quantifiable high-resolution imaging modalities, which are typically non-invasive, rapid and widely available. Such imaging is of unquestionable utility in the assessment of ocular disease however evidence is also mounting for its role in identifying ocular biomarkers of systemic disease, which we term oculomics. In this review, we highlight our current understanding of how retinal morphology evolves in two leading causes of global morbidity and mortality, cardiovascular disease and dementia. Population-based analyses have demonstrated the predictive value of retinal microvascular indices, as measured through fundus photography, in screening for heart attack and stroke. Similarly, the association between the structure of the neurosensory retina and prevalent neurodegenerative disease, in particular Alzheimer's disease, is now well-established. Given the growing size and complexity of emerging multimodal datasets, modern artificial intelligence techniques, such as deep learning, may provide the optimal opportunity to further characterize these associations, enhance our understanding of eye-body relationships and secure novel scalable approaches to the risk stratification of chronic complex disorders of ageing."

The diagnosis of ROP is subclassified by zone, stage, and plus disease, with each area demonstrating significant intra- and interexpert subjectivity and disagreement. In addition to improved efficiencies for ROP screening, artificial intelligence may lead to automated, quantifiable, and objective diagnosis in ROP. This review focuses on the development of artificial intelligence for automated diagnosis of plus disease in ROP and highlights the clinical and technical challenges of both the development and implementation of artificial intelligence in the real world."
32704168,Novel application of an automated-machine learning development tool for predicting burn sepsis: proof of concept,Nam K Tran,"Sepsis is the primary cause of burn-related mortality and morbidity. Traditional indicators of sepsis exhibit poor performance when used in this unique population due to their underlying hypermetabolic and inflammatory response following burn injury. To address this challenge, we developed the Machine Intelligence Learning Optimizer (MILO), an automated machine learning (ML) platform, to automatically produce ML models for predicting burn sepsis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 211 adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with severe burn injury (≥ 20% total body surface area) to generate training and test datasets for ML applications. The MILO approach was compared against an exhaustive ""non-automated"" ML approach as well as standard statistical methods. For this study, traditional multivariate logistic regression (LR) identified seven predictors of burn sepsis when controlled for age and burn size (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.99-4.04, P = 0.032). The area under the ROC (ROC-AUC) when using these seven predictors was 0.88. Next, the non-automated ML approach produced an optimal model based on LR using 16 out of the 23 features from the study dataset. Model accuracy was 86% with ROC-AUC of 0.96. In contrast, MILO identified a k-nearest neighbor-based model using only five features to be the best performer with an accuracy of 90% and a ROC-AUC of 0.96. Machine learning augments burn sepsis prediction. MILO identified models more quickly, with less required features, and found to be analytically superior to traditional ML approaches. Future studies are needed to clinically validate the performance of MILO-derived ML models for sepsis prediction."
32703538,Current Landscape of Imaging and the Potential Role for Artificial Intelligence in the Management of COVID-19,Faiq Shaikh,"The clinical management of COVID-19 is challenging. Medical imaging plays a critical role in the early detection, clinical monitoring and outcomes assessment of this disease. Chest x-ray radiography and computed tomography) are the standard imaging modalities used for the structural assessment of the disease status, while functional imaging (namely, positron emission tomography) has had limited application. Artificial intelligence can enhance the predictive power and utilization of these imaging approaches and new approaches focusing on detection, stratification and prognostication are showing encouraging results. We review the current landscape of these imaging modalities and artificial intelligence approaches as applied in COVID-19 management."
32703127,New Devices for Endoscopic Treatments in Gastroenterology: A Narrative Review,Manuele Furnari,"Endoscopy is in a period of continuous innovations in terms of image quality, endoscopes, post-processing software and lastly, application of Artificial Intelligence. Therapeutic boundaries have expanded, widening the grey zone between endoscopy and surgery, and increasing endoscopic approaches in clinical scenarios where, until a few years ago, surgery was the only option. New scopes and accessories have made it easier to access critical areas such as the biliary tree and the small bowel intestine. In the field of hepato-pancreato-biliary endoscopy (HPB), it is now possible to directly access the biliary ducts or cystic lesions though dedicated stents and scopes, rather than having to rely only on fluoroscopy and ultrasound, increasing the diagnostic and therapeutic options by applying a three-dimensional approach. This narrative review will give an overview of some of the most relevant emerging fields in luminal and HPB endoscopy, highlighting advantages and main limitations of the techniques, and providing considerations for future development."
32702895,Evaluation of an artificial intelligent hydrocephalus diagnosis model based on transfer learning,Weike Duan,"To design and develop artificial intelligence (AI) hydrocephalus (HYC) imaging diagnostic model using a transfer learning algorithm and evaluate its application in the diagnosis of HYC by non-contrast material-enhanced head computed tomographic (CT) images.A training and validation dataset of non-contrast material-enhanced head CT examinations that comprised of 1000 patients with HYC and 1000 normal people with no HYC accumulating to 28,500 images. Images were pre-processed, and the feature variables were labeled. The feature variables were extracted by the neural network for transfer learning. AI algorithm performance was tested on a separate dataset containing 250 examinations of HYC and 250 of normal. Resident, attending and consultant in the department of radiology were also tested with the test sets, their results were compared with the AI model.Final model performance for HYC showed 93.6% sensitivity (95% confidence interval: 77%, 97%) and 94.4% specificity (95% confidence interval: 79%, 98%), with area under the characteristic curve of 0.93. Accuracy rate of model, resident, attending, and consultant were 94.0%, 93.4%, 95.6%, and 97.0%.AI can effectively identify the characteristics of HYC from CT images of the brain and automatically analyze the images. In the future, AI can provide auxiliary diagnosis of image results and reduce the burden on junior doctors."
32702587,The ethics of AI in health care: A mapping review,Jessica Morley,"This article presents a mapping review of the literature concerning the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care. The goal of this review is to summarise current debates and identify open questions for future research. Five literature databases were searched to support the following research question: how can the primary ethical risks presented by AI-health be categorised, and what issues must policymakers, regulators and developers consider in order to be 'ethically mindful? A series of screening stages were carried out-for example, removing articles that focused on digital health in general (e.g. data sharing, data access, data privacy, surveillance/nudging, consent, ownership of health data, evidence of efficacy)-yielding a total of 156 papers that were included in the review. We find that ethical issues can be (a) epistemic, related to misguided, inconclusive or inscrutable evidence; (b) normative, related to unfair outcomes and transformative effectives; or (c) related to traceability. We further find that these ethical issues arise at six levels of abstraction: individual, interpersonal, group, institutional, and societal or sectoral. Finally, we outline a number of considerations for policymakers and regulators, mapping these to existing literature, and categorising each as epistemic, normative or traceability-related and at the relevant level of abstraction. Our goal is to inform policymakers, regulators and developers of what they must consider if they are to enable health and care systems to capitalise on the dual advantage of ethical AI; maximising the opportunities to cut costs, improve care, and improve the efficiency of health and care systems, whilst proactively avoiding the potential harms. We argue that if action is not swiftly taken in this regard, a new 'AI winter' could occur due to chilling effects related to a loss of public trust in the benefits of AI for health care."
32702381,"Influence and interaction of genetic, cognitive, neuroendocrine and personalistic markers to antidepressant response in Chinese patients with major depression",Yan Bi,"Objective: Despite there is a wide range of antidepressants available, with various mechanisms of actions, the efficacy of current therapeutic options is yet satisfactory. Previous shreds of evidence have indicated that genetics, cognitive, neuroendocrine, as well as personality factors, are all intrinsically linked and contribute to the diversity of treatment outcomes. We, therefore, sought to investigate this hypothesis in this study. Method: Based on 610 samples treated with a selection of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) or tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), we compared the therapeutic effects of these four classes of drugs by survival analyses. Pharmacogenomic and survival analyses were carried out to explore the hereditary factors for curative effect and the accumulation of genetic factors was further discussed through pathway analysis and the global test. We built a machine learning-based prediction model that integrates genetic and non-genetic factors (including cognition, endocrinology, personality intelligence) to distinguish drug efficacy in single class drug situations. The values of the non-genetic makers after 6 weeks' treatment were collected to evaluate the efficacy of the model. Results: Our results from the 6-week antidepressant therapeutic study indicated that SSRI and SNRI are better treatments than those of TCA and NaSSA in the Chinese population. Among all possible paired single-agent survival analyses, citalopram and venlafaxine were more effective than mirtazapine. Allele C carriers at rs6354 (SLC6A4) and allele G carriers at rs12150214 (SLC6A4) were significantly prone to poorer treatment response to fluoxetine. Besides, the combination of three loci (rs929377-rs6191-rs32897) located in HPA pathway was significantly associated with the treatment outcome of fluoxetine. In female MDD patients, the minor allele of rs6323 and rs1137070 on the MAOA gene likely lead to a worse response to venlafaxine. Furthermore, genetic variants linked to drug efficacy tended to concentrate on the neurotrophin pathway in depressed patients comorbid with anxiety. From multivariate models, more severe cognitive deficits, psychopathic personality and lower levels of operational intelligence, and higher levels of cortisol predicted worse response status with SSRI or SNRI after 6-week treatment. Notably, genetic factors in the multi-dimensional prediction model for both classes of drugs include loci in HTR2A and CRHBP genes. Conclusion: SSRI and SNRI are more suitable for the treatment of Chinese people with depression. SLC6A4 genetic variants, as well as HPA pathway, play an important role in the fluoxetine antidepressant therapeutic response while the polymorphism of MAOA gene involved in the pharmacological action of venlafaxine among female MDD patients. The presence of anxiety in MDD patients was related to the neurotrophin pathway. Genetic, cognitive, neuroendocrine, and personality intelligence factors combined have an ensemble impact on the medication effect of patients with major depression, leading to more precise and personalized medicine for specific groups of people."
32701983,"Onwards and upwards: The development, piloting and validation of a new measure of academic tenacity- The Bolton Uni-Stride Scale (BUSS)",Chathurika Sewwandi Kannangara,"What factors determine success at University? For many years the construct of intelligence was felt to be critical. More recently, the construct of grit, has attracted the attention of many researchers, along with related concepts such as self-control, growth mind-sets and resilience. The authors of this paper have developed a specific measure of tenacity and self-composure, two constructs crucial to academic achievement. This measure comprises of 12 items drawn from the above constructs, but also including mental well-being and strengths use. In the first study, the authors report on the psychometric properties of the Bolton Uni-Stride Scale (BUSS). The new scale was administered to 1117 university students. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) revealed two underlying factors, one labelled ""tenacity"" had seven items and accounted for 30% of the variance. The second was labelled ""self-composure,"" and accounted for 14% of the variance. In the second study the BUSS was given to 340 undergraduate students along with the Grit Scale, the Self-Control Scale, the Mind-sets Quiz, the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10) and the short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS). This study presented evidence for good internal consistency reliability (.74) and test-retest reliability over three weeks was .70 for Tenacity and .77 for Self-composure. BUSS Academic Tenacity correlated highly with grit (.63), self-control (.59), resilience (.52), mind-sets (.35) and mental well-being (.54). The study also evidences good discriminative validity of the BUSS. A second study conducted confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), explaining a total of 44% of the variance. The authors have shown good support for the reliability and validity of the BUSS scale. It now needs to be tested in other universities and in different countries. It is the contention of the authors that academic tenacity will be a better measure of academic success than other competing measures, such as grit, on their own. Further research is needed to test this assertion."
32701718,Where to next prostate-specific membrane antigen PET imaging frontiers?,Maarten L Donswijk,"Purpose of review: Technical improvements in imaging equipment and availability of radiotracers, such as PSMA-ligands have increased the synergy between Urology and Nuclear Medicine. Meanwhile artificial intelligence is introduced in Nuclear Imaging. This review will give an overview of recent technical and clinical developments and an outlook on application of these in the near future. Recent findings: Digital PET/CT has shown gradual improvement in lesion detection and demarcation over conventional PET/CT, but total-body PET/CT holds promise for a magnitude of improvement in scan duration and quality, quantification, and dose optimization. PET-guided decision-making with the application of PSMA-ligands has been shown useful in demonstrating and biopting primary prostate cancer (PCa) lesions, guiding radiotherapy, guiding surgical resection of recurrent PCa, and assessing therapy response in PCa. Artificial intelligence made its way into Nuclear Imaging just recently, but encouraging progress promises clinical application with unprecedented possibilities. Summary: Evidence is growing on clinical usefulness of PET-guided decision-making with the still relatively new PSMA ligands as a prime example. Rapid evolution of PET instrumentation and clinical introduction of artificial intelligence will be the gamechangers of nuclear imaging in the near future, though its powers should still be mastered and incorporated in clinical practice."
32701620,Developments in X-Ray Contrast Media and the Potential Impact on Computed Tomography,Laura Schöckel,"Over the past 120 years, continuous developments in medical imaging has improved diagnosis and treatment for many diseases and has thereby improved treatment outcome and quality of life of many patients. The number of computed tomography (CT) examinations is today increasing by 4% per year worldwide, for a total of approximately 300 million CT scans per year. About 40% of CT scans are contrast enhanced. Intravenous iodinated contrast media are commonly used for contrast enhancement in CT scans to evaluate diseases and determine treatment response. The current gold standards for intravenous x-ray contrast media in CT or interventional angiography are iodinated low- and iso-osmolar compounds such as iopromide, iohexol, or iodixanol. Both classes have similar and favorable efficacy and safety profiles. Although iodine is biologically inert, iodinated contrast media can cause adverse reactions. In the future, one possibility would be to develop iodine-free contrast media that are better suited to higher x-ray tube voltage ranges, allowing greater flexibility for scanning protocols and thus leading to techniques that can provide equivalent diagnostic value at lower doses of radiation. Iodine-free contrast media would in addition provide an alternative to the market standard that could offer benefits for patients with known reactions to low-osmolality contrast media or thyroid disorders. The development of a new contrast medium, however, needs to be put in context with all upcoming technological advances in x-ray and CT. New detector technologies and artificial intelligence algorithms will in the future also improve the CT image reconstruction enabling the reduction of contrast media and radiation doses."
32700939,Words or numbers? Communicating probability in intelligence analysis,Mandeep K Dhami,"Intelligence analysis is fundamentally an exercise in expert judgment made under conditions of uncertainty. These judgments are used to inform consequential decisions. Following the major intelligence failure that led to the 2003 war in Iraq, intelligence organizations implemented policies for communicating probability in their assessments. Virtually all chose to convey probability using standardized linguistic lexicons in which an ordered set of select probability terms (e.g., highly likely) is associated with numeric ranges (e.g., 80-90%). We review the benefits and drawbacks of this approach, drawing on psychological research on probability communication and studies that have examined the effectiveness of standardized lexicons. We further discuss how numeric probabilities can overcome many of the shortcomings of linguistic probabilities. Numeric probabilities are not without drawbacks (e.g., they are more difficult to elicit and may be misunderstood by receivers with poor numeracy). However, these drawbacks can be ameliorated with training and practice, whereas the pitfalls of linguistic probabilities are endemic to the approach. We propose that, on balance, the benefits of using numeric probabilities outweigh their drawbacks. Given the enormous costs associated with intelligence failure, the intelligence community should reconsider its reliance on using linguistic probabilities to convey probability in intelligence assessments. Our discussion also has implications for probability communication in other domains such as climate science. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."
32700934,"Attention, impulsivity, and vigilance in agenesis of the corpus callosum",Warren S Brown,"Objective: Questions regarding the role of the corpus callosum in attention are raised by the reports of attention problems in some persons with agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC), as well as by abnormalities in callosal size in persons with attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder. The current study assessed inattention, impulsivity, and vigilance in individuals with AgCC. Method: These domains of attention were assessed using the Conners' Continuous Performance Test II in 18 older adolescents and adults (ages 16-52) with complete AgCC and normal intelligence (full scale intelligence quotient > 80). Scores were converted to T scores using age-specific norms and assessed for departure from the normative sample. Results: Scores were significantly elevated in older adolescents with AgCC for errors of commission (p = .050, d = 0.55) and detectability (p = .03, d = 0.58). Older adolescents were worse than adults for commissions (p = .06, ηp² = .201) and detectability (p = .03, ηp² = .273). Also, male individuals had significantly higher (worse) scores than did female in vigilance (p = .01, ηp² = .337). Conclusion: These results suggest moderate levels of difficulties in sustained attention in AgCC, particularly in maintaining response inhibition and in vigilance, that are modulated by age and sex.

32700925,A toolbox approach to improving the measurement of attention control,Christopher Draheim,"Cognitive tasks that produce reliable and robust effects at the group level often fail to yield reliable and valid individual differences. An ongoing debate among attention researchers is whether conflict resolution mechanisms are task-specific or domain-general, and the lack of correlation between most attention measures seems to favor the view that attention control is not a unitary concept. We have argued that the use of difference scores, particularly in reaction time (RT), is the primary cause of null and conflicting results at the individual differences level, and that methodological issues with existing tasks preclude making strong theoretical conclusions. The present article is an empirical test of this view in which we used a toolbox approach to develop and validate new tasks hypothesized to reflect attention processes. Here, we administered existing, modified, and new attention tasks to over 400 participants (final N = 396). Compared with the traditional Stroop and flanker tasks, performance on the accuracy-based measures was more reliable, had stronger intercorrelations, formed a more coherent latent factor, and had stronger associations to measures of working memory capacity and fluid intelligence. Further, attention control fully accounted for the relationship between working memory capacity and fluid intelligence. These results show that accuracy-based measures can be better suited to individual differences investigations than traditional RT tasks, particularly when the goal is to maximize prediction. We conclude that attention control is a unitary concept. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)."
32700519,Programmable Digital Liquid Metal Droplets in Reconfigurable Magnetic Fields,Xiangpeng Li,"Gallium-based liquid metals exhibit excellent locomotion and deformation capabilities under external stimuli and has potential in developing intelligent robots. Programing the locomotion and morphology of the Liquid metal (LM) to endow it with functionalities and intelligence as robots is charming but remains challenging. In this study, we develop a programmable digital LM (PDLM) control platform that can realize versatile locomotion and morphological manipulation of magnetic LM (MLM) droplets using arrays of electromagnets. We demonstrate on-demand transportation, deformation, breakup, and merging of multiple MLM droplets simultaneously and precisely. We find that the intriguing behaviors of MLM under a magnetic field are due to the interplay of surface tension and magnetic forces. Furthermore, we present a functional cooperative droplet robot by equipping the MLM droplets with three-dimensionally printed microtool modules. We show that both the position and orientation of a rod-shaped object can be precisely manipulated by the cooperation of the MLM droplet robots. More interestingly, we explore the capability of the MLM droplet robots for cooperatively handling a copper wire to connect and disconnect electronic circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that the PDLM control platform is capable of programing a group of MLM droplets to accomplish a digital display task. We believe that the PDLM control system presents a promising potential in developing LM-based reconfigurable circuits, digital display systems, and biomimetic soft robotic systems with high controllability, multifunctionalities, and intelligence."
32700308,Psychological adaptation in children with autism spectrum disorder and its effect on family quality of life],D Garrido,"Introduction: In most children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), other difficulties that do not fall within the diagnostic criteria arose, and could have an impact on family quality of life. Previous research has shown several relationships among these variables and family quality of life, however results are contradictories. Aim: To examine the role of psychological adaptation (including emotional symptoms, behavioral problems, hyperactivity, problems with peers, and prosocial behavior) in children with ASD and typical development, and its impact on family quality of life. Subjects and methods: Twenty-four families of children with ASD (level 1 of support) and 25 families of children with typical development between 6 and 13 years old. We have considered diagnosis of Asperger syndrome (following DSM-IV-TR) with ASD-level 1 of support (following DSM-5). We have evaluated intelligence, vocabulary, adaptive behavior, and family quality of life. Results: We have found significant differences in those variables related to psychological adaptation, and in some components of the family quality of life (family interaction, physical and emotional wellbeing). In our regression model, prosocial behaviors and the group were the main predictors of satisfaction on family quality of life. Conclusion: It is important to pay attention to the prosocial behaviors in ASD due to its potential protective effect."
32699519,Digital technology and social change: the digital transformation of society from a historical perspective,Martin Hilbert,"Digital technology, including its omnipresent connectedness and its powerful artificial intelligence, is the most recent long wave of humanity's socioeconomic evolution. The first technological revolutions go all the way back to the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages, when the transformation of material was the driving force in the Schumpeterian process of creative destruction. A second metaparadigm of societal modernization was dedicated to the transformation of energy (aka the ""industrial revolutions""), including water, steam, electric, and combustion power. The current metaparadigm focuses on the transformation of information. Less than 1% of the world's technologically stored information was in digital format in the late 1980s, surpassing more than 99% by 2012. Every 2.5 to 3 years, humanity is able to store more information than since the beginning of civilization. The current age focuses on algorithms that automate the conversion of data into actionable knowledge. This article reviews the underlying theoretical framework and some accompanying data from the perspective of innovation theory. ."
32699518,Brain health consequences of digital technology use,Gary W Small,"Emerging scientific evidence indicates that frequent digital technology use has a significant impact-both negative and positive-on brain function and behavior. Potential harmful effects of extensive screen time and technology use include heightened attention-deficit symptoms, impaired emotional and social intelligence, technology addiction, social isolation, impaired brain development, and disrupted sleep. However, various apps, videogames, and other online tools may benefit brain health. Functional imaging scans show that internet-naive older adults who learn to search online show significant increases in brain neural activity during simulated internet searches. Certain computer programs and videogames may improve memory, multitasking skills, fluid intelligence, and other cognitive abilities. Some apps and digital tools offer mental health interventions providing self-management, monitoring, skills training, and other interventions that may improve mood and behavior. Additional research on the positive and negative brain health effects of technology is needed to elucidate mechanisms and underlying causal relationships. ."

32699167,Artificial intelligence mobile health platform for early detection of COVID-19 in quarantine subjects using a wearable biosensor: protocol for a randomised controlled trial,Chun Ka Wong,"Introduction: There is an outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide. As there is no effective therapy or vaccine yet, rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures such as isolation and quarantine remains the most effective tool to control the outbreak. When an asymptomatic individual with COVID-19 exposure is being quarantined, it is necessary to perform temperature and symptom surveillance. As such surveillance is intermittent in nature and highly dependent on self-discipline, it has limited effectiveness. Advances in biosensor technologies made it possible to continuously monitor physiological parameters using wearable biosensors with a variety of form factors. Objective: To explore the potential of using wearable biosensors to continuously monitor multidimensional physiological parameters for early detection of COVID-19 clinical progression. Method: This randomised controlled open-labelled trial will involve 200-1000 asymptomatic subjects with close COVID-19 contact under mandatory quarantine at designated facilities in Hong Kong. Subjects will be randomised to receive a remote monitoring strategy (intervention group) or standard strategy (control group) in a 1:1 ratio during the 14 day-quarantine period. In addition to fever and symptom surveillance in the control group, subjects in the intervention group will wear wearable biosensors on their arms to continuously monitor skin temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation and daily activities. These physiological parameters will be transferred in real time to a smartphone application called Biovitals Sentinel. These data will then be processed using a cloud-based multivariate physiology analytics engine called Biovitals to detect subtle physiological changes.

32698936,It Must have been Burnout: Prevalence and Related Factors among Spanish PhD Students,Miguel A Sorrel,"Recent studies in different countries indicate that PhD students are more vulnerable to psychological disorders compared to the general population. No such data are available for the Spanish population. This study addresses this issue by studying prevalence rates and factors related to a common response to prolonged stress such as burnout syndrome. Burnout, emotional abilities, resilience, satisfaction with the dissertation advisor, and sociodemographic data were collected from 305 PhD students. The results indicated that the burnout rates are high in this group, especially for the emotional exhaustion dimension. Different linear regression models explained between 14% and 41% of the overall burnout scores variance and its dimensions. The psychological variables and the satisfaction with the dissertation advisor were the most relevant predictors. Consistent with what has been found in other countries, the evidence found indicates that the mental state of PhD students in Spain is alarming. The results of this study have important implications for the design and implementation of interventions to alleviate this problem."
32698869,Use of AI-based tools for healthcare purposes: a survey study from consumers' perspectives,Pouyan Esmaeilzadeh,"Background: Several studies highlight the effects of artificial intelligence (AI) systems on healthcare delivery. AI-based tools may improve prognosis, diagnostics, and care planning. It is believed that AI will be an integral part of healthcare services in the near future and will be incorporated into several aspects of clinical care. Thus, many technology companies and governmental projects have invested in producing AI-based clinical tools and medical applications. Patients can be one of the most important beneficiaries and users of AI-based applications whose perceptions may affect the widespread use of AI-based tools. Patients should be ensured that they will not be harmed by AI-based devices, and instead, they will be benefited by using AI technology for healthcare purposes. Although AI can enhance healthcare outcomes, possible dimensions of concerns and risks should be addressed before its integration with routine clinical care. Methods: We develop a model mainly based on value perceptions due to the specificity of the healthcare field. This study aims at examining the perceived benefits and risks of AI medical devices with clinical decision support (CDS) features from consumers' perspectives. We use an online survey to collect data from 307 individuals in the United States. Results: The proposed model identifies the sources of motivation and pressure for patients in the development of AI-based devices. The results show that technological, ethical (trust factors), and regulatory concerns significantly contribute to the perceived risks of using AI applications in healthcare. Of the three categories, technological concerns (i.e., performance and communication feature) are found to be the most significant predictors of risk beliefs. Conclusions: This study sheds more light on factors affecting perceived risks and proposes some recommendations on how to practically reduce these concerns. The findings of this study provide implications for research and practice in the area of AI-based CDS. Regulatory agencies, in cooperation with healthcare institutions, should establish normative standard and evaluation guidelines for the implementation and use of AI in healthcare. Regular audits and ongoing monitoring and reporting systems can be used to continuously evaluate the safety, quality, transparency, and ethical factors of AI-based services."
32698834,Clinician-centric diagnosis of rare genetic diseases: performance of a gene pertinence metric in decision support for clinicians,Michael M Segal,"Background: In diagnosis of rare genetic diseases we face a decision as to the degree to which the sequencing lab offers one or more diagnoses based on clinical input provided by the clinician, or the clinician reaches a diagnosis based on the complete set of variants provided by the lab. We tested a software approach to assist the clinician in making the diagnosis based on clinical findings and an annotated genomic variant table, using cases already solved using less automated processes. Results: For the 81 cases studied (involving 216 individuals), 70 had genetic abnormalities with phenotypes previously described in the literature, and 11 were not described in the literature at the time of analysis (""discovery genes""). These included cases beyond a trio, including ones with different variants in the same gene. In 100% of cases the abnormality was recognized. Of the 70, the abnormality was ranked #1 in 94% of cases, with an average rank 1.1 for all cases. Large CNVs could be analyzed in an integrated analysis, performed in 24 of the cases. The process is rapid enough to allow for periodic reanalysis of unsolved cases. Conclusions: A clinician-friendly environment for clinical correlation can be provided to clinicians who are best positioned to have the clinical information needed for this interpretation."
32698581,Machine-Intelligence-Driven High-Throughput Prediction of 2D Charge Density Wave Phases,Arnab Kabiraj,"Charge density wave (CDW) materials are an important subclass of two-dimensional materials exhibiting significant resistivity switching with the application of external energy. However, the scarcity of such materials impedes their practical applications in nanoelectronics. Here we combine a first-principles-based structure-searching technique and unsupervised machine learning to develop a fully automated high-throughput computational framework, which identifies CDW phases from a unit cell with inherited Kohn anomaly. The proposed methodology not only rediscovers the known CDW phases but also predicts a host of easily exfoliable CDW materials (30 materials and 114 phases) along with associated electronic structures. Among many promising candidates, we pay special attention to ZrTiSe4 and conduct a comprehensive analysis to gain insight into the Fermi surface nesting, which causes significant semiconducting gap opening in its CDW phase. Our findings could provide useful guidelines for experimentalists."
32698405,The Evidence for Geary's Theory on the Role of Mitochondrial Functioning in Human Intelligence Is Not Entirely Convincing,Anna-Lena Schubert,"Geary (2018, 2019) suggested that heritable and environmentally caused differences in mitochondrial functioning affect the integrity and efficiency of neurons and supporting glia cells and may thus contribute to individual differences in higher-order cognitive functioning and physical health. In our comment, we want to pose three questions aimed at different aspects of Geary's theory that critically evaluate his theory in the light of evidence from neurocognitive, cognitive enhancement, and behavioral genetics research. We question (1) if Geary's theory explains why certain cognitive processes show a stronger age-related decline than others; (2) if intervention studies in healthy younger adults support the claim that variation in mitochondrial functioning underlies variation in human intelligence; and (3) if predictions arising from the matrilineal heredity of mitochondrial DNA are supported by behavioral genetics research. We come to the conclusion that there are likely many more biological and social factors contributing to variation in human intelligence than mitochondrial functioning."
32698109,Behavioral problems and family distress in tuberous sclerosis complex,Mitsugu Uematsu,"Background: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) have a large impact on patients and their families. Improving intellectual ability outcomes using preventive vigabatrin (VGB) treatment has recently been reported. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the severity of behavioral problems and degree of distress among families of patients with TSC with and without a history of VGB treatment. Method: The study enrolled 21 children and adolescents who were patients with TSC from four hospitals: 14 in the VGB group and 7 in the no-VGB group. To evaluate patients' psychiatric and neurological symptoms, we used the TAND Checklist, Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), and Social Responsive Scale-2nd edition (SRS-2). Results: All VGB-group patients were administered VGB after the onset of epileptic seizures. No obvious differences were observed between the VGB and no-VGB groups in behavioral problem scores on the TAND Checklist, or on the ABC, SCQ, and SRS-2 total scores. Behavioral problem scores were lower in patients with normal intelligence than in those with mild intellectual disability (ID; P = 0.042). Degrees of family distress assessed with the TAND Checklist were not correlated with the intelligence quotient/developmental quotient (IQ/DQ) or seizure frequency but were correlated with the total SRS-2 scores (P = 0.022). For several patients, there were large discrepancies between familial and physician ratings of the TAND impact score. Conclusion: Children and adolescents with TSC may present with significant behavioral difficulties and family distress, regardless of whether they were treated with VGB or not after the onset of seizures. Difficulties in social communication may have the strongest ""TAND impact"" on families."
32697892,Histomorphological investigation of intrahepatic connective tissue for surgical anatomy based on modern computer imaging analysis,Tetsuo Ikeda,"Background/purpose: Computer-assisted tissue imaging and analytical techniques were used to clarify the histomorphological structure of hepatic connective tissue as a practical guide for surgeons. Methods: Approximately 5000 histological slides were prepared from liver specimens of five autopsied patients. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction was performed and subjected to computer imaging analysis. Scanning electron microscopy was also performed on the liver specimens. Results: The 3D reconstructed images revealed the running form of the vasculature and the relationship between the hepatic lobule and connective tissue. The hepatic capsule or portal pedicle was consistently located at the periphery of the hepatic lobules. An artificial intelligence random forest approach clearly segmented hepatic cells, type I collagen (CF), type III collagen (RF), and other cells. The hepatic lobule, portal region, and hepatic capsule were significantly distinguished based on CF and RF occupancy. The capsule directly covering the liver lobule with an RF concentration up to 87% was provisionally named the proper hepatic capsule. The existence of a proper hepatic ligament with distinct occupation rates of CF and RF was also suggested. Conclusions: The identified proper hepatic capsule and ligament can be important markers for demarcating the dissecting layer during surgical procedures."
32697872,The artificial intelligence-assisted cytology diagnostic system in large-scale cervical cancer screening: A population-based cohort study of 0.7 million women,Heling Bao,"Background: Adequate cytology is limited by insufficient cytologists in a large-scale cervical cancer screening. We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted cytology system in cervical cancer screening program. Methods: We conducted a perspective cohort study within a population-based cervical cancer screening program for 0.7 million women, using a validated AI-assisted cytology system. For comparison, cytologists examined all slides classified by AI as abnormal and a randomly selected 10% of normal slides. Each woman with slides classified as abnormal by either AI-assisted or manual reading was diagnosed by colposcopy and biopsy. The outcomes were histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+). Results: Finally, we recruited 703 103 women, of whom 98 549 were independently screened by AI and manual reading. The overall agreement rate between AI and manual reading was 94.7% (95% confidential interval [CI], 94.5%-94.8%), and kappa was 0.92 (0.91-0.92). The detection rates of CIN2+ increased with the severity of cytology abnormality performed by both AI and manual reading (Ptrend < 0.001). General estimated equations showed that detection of CIN2+ among women with ASC-H or HSIL by AI were significantly higher than corresponding groups classified by cytologists (for ASC-H: odds ratio [OR] = 1.22, 95%CI 1.11-1.34, P < .001; for HSIL: OR = 1.41, 1.28-1.55, P < .001). AI-assisted cytology was 5.8% (3.0%-8.6%) more sensitive for detection of CIN2+ than manual reading with a slight reduction in specificity. Conclusions: AI-assisted cytology system could exclude most of normal cytology, and improve sensitivity with clinically equivalent specificity for detection of CIN2+ compared with manual cytology reading. Overall, the results support AI-based cytology system for the primary cervical cancer screening in large-scale population."
32697810,Assessment of emotional intelligence in adults with down syndrome: Psychometric properties of the Emotional Quotient Inventory,David Sánchez-Teruel,"Introduction: The Emotional Quotient Inventory: Youth version-EQ-i:YV was developed by Bar-On & Parker in 2000 and later translated and adapted for the general Spanish adolescent population by Ferrandiz et al. in 2012. The Spanish scale presents similar psychometric properties to the original version (54 items and five subdimensions). The Emotional Quotient Inventory assesses a set of personal, emotional, and social skills that influence adaptation to and coping with environmental demands and pressures. These factors can influence an adolescent's success later in life, health, and psychological well-being. Traditionally, research in Down syndrome (DS) has focused on identifying cognitive deficits, relatively little is known about emotional intelligence (EI) and there are no scales that measure EI in people with DS adults. Objectives: To validate and analyze the psychometric properties of the scale in the clinical population, specifically in Spanish adults with DS (EQ-i: SVDS). Methods: A cross-sectional investigation was carried out in several stages. Descriptive, exploratory factorial (n = 345), confirmatory (n = 397), and scale reliability analyses were performed with better goodness-of-adjustment indices. Results: A new scale named Emotional Quotient Inventory: Short Version for DS adults was obtained with a structure of four factors called mood, stress management, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. This new scale was reduced to 25 items. Goodness-of-fit indices were excellent (RMSEA [95% CI] = 02[.01; .03]; CFI = .99; TLI = .98; GFI = .87; AGFI = .89). The internal consistency of the four dimensions and the calculated total score (α = .91, ω = .93 and divided halves = .90) yielded high values in this clinical sample. Discussion: The results recommend the use of the revised EQ-i: YV, the EQ-i: SVDS, to assess EI in adults with DS. The psychometric properties of this study are satisfactory but have four factors. The findings are discussed in terms of future research and practical implication to gain a more thorough understanding of how this population behaves on both a general and preventive level in order to teach EI properly. Conclusions: This new version is a valid and reliable tool to evaluate emotional intelligence in people with intellectual disabilities and specifically in Spanish adults with DS."
32697706,Performances on individual neurocognitive tests by people experiencing a current major depression episode: A systematic review and meta-analysis,William L Parkinson,"Background and purposes: Previous meta-analyses on neurocognitive test performances in depression have provided effect sizes for cognitive domains. Most domain effect sizes have medium to high variance heterogeneity. Restriction to each test performance could reduce variance and clarify differing test effect sizes. This systematic review and meta-analysis were done to 1. provide effect sizes for cognitive performances (test, subtest, or multiple measures within tests), and 2. investigate age as an effect modifier. Methods: Inclusion criteria were: 1. active major depression episode (MD), 2. a control group, 3 reported means and standard deviations, 4. non-computerized tests previously studied at least 3 times. Meta-analyses were performed using Cochrane Review Manager. Age under versus over 45 was investigated as an effect moderator. Results: Twenty-seven studies met criteria. MD patients performed significantly poorer on 16 of 16 neurocognitive measures (random effects d = -0.47 to -0.92 across tests). Variance was heterogeneous for 11 of 16 measures. Differences between cognitive measures were largely absent based on overlapping 95% confidence intervals. Effect sizes did not differ under versus over 45 years. Limitations: Bias risk assessment showed limited control for subject selection, comparability of depressed and control groups, pre-morbid intelligence, drug treatment, and effort in testing. Conclusions: The depression - cognition effect was in the moderate to large range regardless of test type. Variance heterogeneity was substantial despite exclusion of inactive depression and the absence of test pooling. The size of the depression - cognition effect was not a function of age."
32697233,"Nano-engineering and functionalization of hybrid Au-MexOy-TiO2 (Me = W, Ga) hetero-interfaces for optoelectronic receptors and nociceptors",Hongyan Xu,"Bio-inspired nano-electronic devices are key instruments for the development of advanced artificial intelligence systems, which will shape the future of humanoid nano-robotics. An emerging demand is realized for an accurate reception of environmental stimuli via visual perception, processing and realization of optical signals. The present study demonstrates the capability of functionalized all-oxide heterostructured two-dimensional (2D) plasmonic devices for the self-adaptive recognition of visual optical pulses. Specifically, the nano-engineering of the metal/semiconductor interface and co-modulation of heterostructured 2D semiconductor hetero-interfaces of Au/WO3 : TiO2 and Au/Ga2O3 : TiO2 facilitated the receptive and nociceptive detection of visible light pulses. A decrease in the dark current of the Au/WO3 : TiO2 unit resulted in the development of sensitive visible light photoreceptors. Furthermore, the modulation of charge transfers at the Au/Ga2O3 : TiO2 hetero-interfaces were the key parameter to determine the optical reception characteristics and nociceptive performance of all-oxide optoelectronic devices. Specifically, the rapid thermal annealing (RTA) of 2D Ga2O3 in N2 atmosphere ensured the modulation of charge transfer at Au/Ga2O3 : TiO2 hetero-interfaces in plasmonic devices. Thus, hetero-interface engineering enabled the effective control of charge transfer at 2D hetero-interfaces for an adaptive perception of visible optical pulses. Consequently, the fabricated sensitive Au/Ga2O3 (N2) : TiO2 bio-inspired unit emulated the optical functionalities of corneal nociceptors."
32696663,GARFIELD-AF: a worldwide prospective registry of patients with atrial fibrillation at risk of stroke,Jean-Pierre Bassand,"The Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field-Atrial Fibrillation (GARFIELD-AF) examined real-world practice in a total of 57,149 (5069 retrospective, 52,080 prospective) patients with newly diagnosed AF at risk of stroke/systemic embolism, enrolled at over 1000 centers in 35 countries. It aimed to capture data on AF burden, patients' clinical profile, patterns of clinical practice and antithrombotic management, focusing on stroke/systemic embolism prevention, uptake of new oral anticoagulants, impact on death and bleeding. GARFIELD-AF set new standards for quality of data collection and analysis. A total of 36 peer-reviewed articles were already published and 73 abstracts presented at international congresses, covering treatment strategies, geographical variations in baseline risk and therapies, adverse outcomes and common comorbidities such as heart failure. A risk prediction tool as well as innovative observational studies and artificial intelligence methodologies are currently being developed by GARFIELD-AF researchers.

32696622,DAS-II Cognitive Profiles Are Not Diagnostically Meaningful For Autism: A ROC Analysis,Caitlin C Clements,"Intelligence assessment is an integral part of a comprehensive autism evaluation. Many past studies have described a cognitive profile of autistic individuals characterized by higher nonverbal than verbal IQ scores. The diagnostic utility of this profile, however, remains unknown. We leveraged receiver operating characteristic methods to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of three different IQ profiles in a large sample of children who have an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis (N = 1,228, Simons Simplex Collection) who completed the Differential Ability Scales-Second Edition (DAS-II), School Age compared to the normative sample provided by the DAS-II publisher (N = 2,200). The frequently discussed nonverbal > verbal IQ profile performed near chance at distinguishing ASD from normative individuals (AUC: 0.54, 95% CI [0.52-0.56]), and performed significantly worse for females than males (AUC: females: 0.46 [0.41-0.52]; males: 0.55 [0.53-0.58]). All cognitive profiles showed AUC < 0.56. We conclude that while significant differences between verbal and nonverbal IQ scores exist at the group level, these differences are small in an absolute sense and not meaningful at an individual level. We do not recommend using cognitive profiles to aid in autism diagnostic decision-making. LAY SUMMARY: Some researchers and clinicians have reported an ""autistic cognitive profile"" of higher nonverbal intelligence than verbal intelligence. In an analysis of over 1,000 autistic children, we found that the group's average nonverbal intelligence is usually higher than their verbal intelligence. However, this pattern should not be used by clinicians to make an individual diagnosis of autism because our results show it is not helpful nor accurate."
32696559,Rationale and design of a risk-guided strategy for reducing readmissions for acute decompensated heart failure: the Risk-HF study,Georgios Zisis,"Aims: Heart failure (HF) readmission commonly arises owing to insufficient patient knowledge and failure of recognition of the early stages of recurrent fluid congestion. In previous work, we developed a score to predict short-term hospital readmission and showed that higher-risk patients benefit most from a disease management programme (DMP) that included enhancing knowledge and education by a nurse. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, nurse-led HF DMP in selected patients at high risk of short-term hospital readmission, using ultrasound-guided diuretic management and artificial intelligence to enhance HF knowledge in an outpatient setting. Methods and results: Risk-HF is a prospective multisite randomized controlled trial that will allocate 404 patients hospitalized with acute decompensated HF, and ≥33% risk of readmission and/or death at 30 days, into risk-guided nurse intervention (DMP-Plus group) compared with usual care. Intervention elements include (i) fluid management with a handheld ultrasound (HHU) device at point of care; (ii) post-discharge follow-up; (iii) optimal programmed drug titration; (iv) better transition of care; (v) intensive self-care education via an avatar-based 'digital health coach'; and (vi) exercise guidance through the digital coach. Usual care involves standard post-discharge hospital care. The primary outcome is reduced death and/or hospital readmissions at 30 days post-discharge, and secondary outcomes include quality of life, fluid management efficacy, and feasibility and patient engagement. Assuming that our intervention will reduce readmissions and/or deaths by 50%, with a 1:1 ratio of intervention vs. usual care, we plan to randomize 404 patients to show a difference at a statistical power of 80%, using a two-sided alpha of 0.05. We anticipate this recruitment will be achieved by screening 2020 hospitalized HF patients for eligibility. An 8 week pilot programme of our digital health coach in 21 HF patients, age > 75 years, showed overall improvements in quality of life (13 of 21), self-care (12 of 21), and HF knowledge (13 of 21). A pilot of the use of HHU by nurses showed that it was feasible and accurate. Conclusions: The Risk-HF trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a risk-guided intervention to improve HF outcomes and will evaluate the efficacy of trained HF nurses delivering a fluid management protocol that is guided by lung ultrasound with an HHU at point of care."
32696160,The Impact of Dermal Fillers on Perceived Personality Traits and Attractiveness,Sammy Othman,"Background: Dermal fillers are increasingly popular for facial rejuvenation and enhancement, including effacement of nasolabial folds (NLFs) and marionette lines and lip augmentation. This study aimed to evaluate casual observer perception of physical and interpersonal traits of subjects who receive filler treatment. Methods: An anonymous survey of 8 before/after treatment photographical sets was administered in Likert scale format (1-7) using online crowdsourcing. Three sets of photographs were before/after NLF/ marionette line treatment, three of lip augmentation, and two internal controls. Respondents were surveyed on personal demographics, as well as perceptions of subject photographs across nine domains (facial symmetry, confidence, likeability, youthfulness, trustworthiness, attractiveness, intelligence, approachability, happiness). Results: In total, 260 respondents completed the survey. The majority were male (63.1%), Caucasian (58.1%), 18-34 years old (58.1%), and college graduates (66.2%). Respondents rated photographs with line filler treatment and lip filler treatment as significantly improved compared to the pre-treatment photographs across all nine trait domains [p < 0.001, for all]. No differences were found between the control photosets [p > 0.05, for all]. Middle-aged respondents (35-55 years) were more likely to perceive treated filler photographs as more youthful than younger respondents (18-34 years) [p < 0.006] Additionally, respondents with lower educational attainment (high-school graduate or less) were more likely to perceive treated patients as less intelligent compared to higher-educated respondents (college/postgraduates) [p < 0.05, for both]. Conclusion: The use of dermal fillers for treatment of NLF/marionette lines and lip augmentation have significant associations with the perception of improved attractiveness and several personality traits. Additionally, casual observer demographic subgroups may influence perceptions. Level of evidence iv: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

32696125,Limited evidence for the effect of red color on cognitive performance: A meta-analysis,Timo Gnambs,"Red color supposedly affects cognitive functioning in achievement situations and impairs test performance. Although this has been shown for different cognitive domains in different populations and cultural contexts, recent studies including close replications failed to corroborate this effect. Reported here is a random-effects meta-analysis of 67 effect sizes (38 samples) that compared test performance after viewing red or a control color. For anagram tests and knowledge tests no significant difference between color conditions was found (Cohen's d of -0.06 and -0.04); for reasoning tests the pooled effect of d = -0.34, 95% CI [-0.61, -0.06] indicated significantly lower scores in the red condition. The cumulative meta-analysis revealed substantially larger effects in initial studies as compared to subsequent research. After correcting for publication bias no evidential value for an effect of red color on intellectual performance was available. The review casts doubt on the existence of a robust color-priming effect in achievement situations."
32696074,Predicting intelligence from brain gray matter volume,Kirsten Hilger,"A positive association between brain size and intelligence is firmly established, but whether region-specific anatomical differences contribute to general intelligence remains an open question. Results from voxel-based morphometry (VBM) - one of the most widely used morphometric methods - have remained inconclusive so far. Here, we applied cross-validated machine learning-based predictive modeling to test whether out-of-sample prediction of individual intelligence scores is possible on the basis of voxel-wise gray matter volume. Features were derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging data (N = 308) using (a) a purely data-driven method (principal component analysis) and (b) a domain knowledge-based approach (atlas parcellation). When using relative gray matter (corrected for total brain size), only the atlas-based approach provided significant prediction, while absolute gray matter (uncorrected) allowed for above-chance prediction with both approaches. Importantly, in all significant predictions, the absolute error was relatively high, i.e., greater than ten IQ points, and in the atlas-based models, the predicted IQ scores varied closely around the sample mean. This renders the practical value even of statistically significant prediction results questionable. Analyses based on the gray matter of functional brain networks yielded significant predictions for the fronto-parietal network and the cerebellum. However, the mean absolute errors were not reduced in contrast to the global models, suggesting that general intelligence may be related more to global than region-specific differences in gray matter volume. More generally, our study highlights the importance of predictive statistical analysis approaches for clarifying the neurobiological bases of intelligence and provides important suggestions for future research using predictive modeling."
32695795,Artificial Intelligence in Cardiac Imaging With Statistical Atlases of Cardiac Anatomy,Kathleen Gilbert,"In many cardiovascular pathologies, the shape and motion of the heart provide important clues to understanding the mechanisms of the disease and how it progresses over time. With the advent of large-scale cardiac data, statistical modeling of cardiac anatomy has become a powerful tool to provide automated, precise quantification of the status of patient-specific heart geometry with respect to reference populations. Powered by supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms, statistical cardiac shape analysis can be used to automatically identify and quantify the severity of heart diseases, to provide morphometric indices that are optimally associated with clinical factors, and to evaluate the likelihood of adverse outcomes. Recently, statistical cardiac atlases have been integrated with deep neural networks to enable anatomical consistency of cardiac segmentation, registration, and automated quality control. These combinations have already shown significant improvements in performance and avoid gross anatomical errors that could make the results unusable. This current trend is expected to grow in the near future. Here, we aim to provide a mini review highlighting recent advances in statistical atlasing of cardiac function in the context of artificial intelligence in cardiac imaging."
32695761,A New Method Based on CEEMD Combined With Iterative Feature Reduction for Aided Diagnosis of Epileptic EEG,Mengran Zhou,"In the clinical diagnosis of epileptic diseases, the intelligent diagnosis of epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has become a research focus in the field of brain diseases. In order to solve the problem of time-consuming and easily influenced by human subjective factors, artificial intelligence pattern recognition algorithm has been applied to EEG signals recognition. However, at present, the common empirical mode decomposition (EMD) signal decomposition algorithm does not consider the problem of mode aliasing. The EEG features obtained by feature extraction may be mixed with some unimportant features that affect the classification accuracy. In this paper, we proposed a new method based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) combined with iterative feature reduction for aided diagnosis of epileptic EEG. First of all, the evaluation indexes of decomposing and reconstructing signals by several methods were compared. The CEEMD was selected as the decomposition method of the signals. Then, the support vector machine recursive elimination (SVM-RFE) was used to reduce 9 features extracted from EEG data. The support vector classification of the gray wolf optimizer (GWO-SVC) recognition model was established for different feature subsets. By comparing the classification accuracy of training set and test set of different feature subsets, and considering the complexity of the model reflected by the number of features selected by SVM-RFE, the analysis showed that the 6 feature subsets with fewer features and higher classification accuracy could reflect the key information of epileptic EEG. The accuracy of the training set classification was 99.38% and the test set was as high as 100%. The recognition time was only 1.6551 s. Finally, in order to verify the reliability of the algorithm proposed in this paper, the proposed algorithm compared with the classification model established by the raw EEG signals and the optimization model established by other intelligent optimization algorithms. It is found that the algorithm used in this paper has higher classification accuracy and faster recognition time than other processing methods. The experimental results show that CEEMD combined with SVM-RFE is feasible for rapid and accurate recognition of EEG signals, which provides a theoretical basis for the aided diagnosis of epilepsy."
32695048,Using Mobile Devices in Teaching Large University Classes: How Does It Affect Exam Success?,Tommaso Feraco,"The aim of this study was to examine the role of mobile-based student response systems in teaching to improve university students' academic outcomes. Mobile devices can be useful tools for conveying content to large classes, with a potential impact on academic outcomes. This study involved a total of 294 undergraduates taking a psychology course. The course involved lessons in the classroom, which included answering quizzes (quiz activities) and activities such as preparing reports and laboratory experiences (out-of-class activities). Quizzes were administered using a mobile technology system. Data were collected on the motivational beliefs (theory of intelligence) and self-regulated learning strategies of students who voluntarily completed the online questionnaires. The results of the linear models showed that using the quizzes positively affected the performance in the final exams (involving closed and open questions). The same was true for the out-of-class activities. The motivation and strategy scores correlated moderately with out-of-class activities, but not with quiz activities. These results offer insight on the use of technology during lessons and other course-related activities to promote academic achievement."
32694991,Accelerating Therapeutics for Opportunities in Medicine: A Paradigm Shift in Drug Discovery,Izumi V Hinkson,"Conventional drug discovery is long and costly, and suffers from high attrition rates, often leaving patients with limited or expensive treatment options. Recognizing the overwhelming need to accelerate this process and increase success, the ATOM consortium was formed by government, industry, and academic partners in October 2017. ATOM applies a team science and open-source approach to foster a paradigm shift in drug discovery. ATOM is developing and validating a precompetitive, preclinical, small molecule drug discovery platform that simultaneously optimizes pharmacokinetics, toxicity, protein-ligand interactions, systems-level models, molecular design, and novel compound generation. To achieve this, the ATOM Modeling Pipeline (AMPL) has been developed to enable advanced and emerging machine learning (ML) approaches to build models from diverse historical drug discovery data. This modular pipeline has been designed to couple with a generative algorithm that optimizes multiple parameters necessary for drug discovery. ATOM's approach is to consider the full pharmacology and therapeutic window of the drug concurrently, through computationally-driven design, thereby reducing the number of molecules that are selected for experimental validation. Here, we discuss the role of collaborative efforts such as consortia and public-private partnerships in accelerating cross disciplinary innovation and the development of open-source tools for drug discovery."
32694787,An artificial intelligence decision support system for the management of type 1 diabetes,Nichole S Tyler,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and insulin depletion. Over 40% of people with T1D manage their glucose through multiple injections of long-acting basal and short-acting bolus insulin, so-called multiple daily injections (MDI)1,2. Errors in dosing can lead to life-threatening hypoglycaemia events (<70 mg dl-1) and hyperglycaemia (>180 mg dl-1), increasing the risk of retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Machine learning (artificial intelligence) approaches are being harnessed to incorporate decision support into many medical specialties. Here, we report an algorithm that provides weekly insulin dosage recommendations to adults with T1D using MDI therapy. We employ a unique virtual platform3 to generate over 50,000 glucose observations to train a k-nearest neighbours4 decision support system (KNN-DSS) to identify causes of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia and determine necessary insulin adjustments from a set of 12 potential recommendations. The KNN-DSS algorithm achieves an overall agreement with board-certified endocrinologists of 67.9% when validated on real-world human data, and delivers safe recommendations, per endocrinologist review. A comparison of inter-physician-recommended adjustments to insulin pump therapy indicates full agreement of 41.2% among endocrinologists, which is consistent with previous measures of inter-physician agreement (41-45%)5. In silico3,6 benchmarking using a platform accepted by the United States Food and Drug Administration for evaluation of artificial pancreas technologies indicates substantial improvement in glycaemic outcomes after 12 weeks of KNN-DSS use. Our data indicate that the KNN-DSS allows for early identification of dangerous insulin regimens and may be used to improve glycaemic outcomes and prevent life-threatening complications in people with T1D."
32694453,Impact of Confounding Thoracic Tubes and Pleural Dehiscence Extent on Artificial Intelligence Pneumothorax Detection in Chest Radiographs,Johannes Rueckel,"Objectives: We hypothesized that published performances of algorithms for artificial intelligence (AI) pneumothorax (PTX) detection in chest radiographs (CXRs) do not sufficiently consider the influence of PTX size and confounding effects caused by thoracic tubes (TTs). Therefore, we established a radiologically annotated benchmarking cohort (n = 6446) allowing for a detailed subgroup analysis. Materials and methods: We retrospectively identified 6434 supine CXRs, among them 1652 PTX-positive cases and 4782 PTX-negative cases. Supine CXRs were radiologically annotated for PTX size, PTX location, and inserted TTs. The diagnostic performances of 2 AI algorithms (""AI_CheXNet"" [Rajpurkar et al], ""AI_1.5"" [Guendel et al]), both trained on publicly available datasets with labels obtained from automatic report interpretation, were quantified. The algorithms' discriminative power for PTX detection was quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC), and significance analysis was based on the corresponding 95% confidence interval. A detailed subgroup analysis was performed to quantify the influence of PTX size and the confounding effects caused by inserted TTs. Results: Algorithm performance was quantified as follows: overall performance with AUROCs of 0.704 (AI_1.5) / 0.765 (AI_CheXNet) for unilateral PTXs, AUROCs of 0.666 (AI_1.5) / 0.722 (AI_CheXNet) for unilateral PTXs smaller than 1 cm, and AUROCs of 0.735 (AI_1.5) / 0.818 (AI_CheXNet) for unilateral PTXs larger than 2 cm. Subgroup analysis identified TTs to be strong confounders that significantly influence algorithm performance: Discriminative power is completely eliminated by analyzing PTX-positive cases without TTs referenced to control PTX-negative cases with inserted TTs. Contrarily, AUROCs increased up to 0.875 (AI_CheXNet) for large PTX-positive cases with inserted TTs referenced to control cases without TTs. Conclusions: Our detailed subgroup analysis demonstrated that the performance of established AI algorithms for PTX detection trained on public datasets strongly depends on PTX size and is significantly biased by confounding image features, such as inserted TTS. Our established, clinically relevant and radiologically annotated benchmarking cohort might be of great benefit for ongoing algorithm development."
32694344,Deployment of Artificial Intelligence in Real-World Practice: Opportunity and Challenge,Mingguang He,"Artificial intelligence has rapidly evolved from the experimental phase to the implementation phase in many image-driven clinical disciplines, including ophthalmology. A combination of the increasing availability of large datasets and computing power with revolutionary progress in deep learning has created unprecedented opportunities for major breakthrough improvements in the performance and accuracy of automated diagnoses that primarily focus on image recognition and feature detection. Such an automated disease classification would significantly improve the accessibility, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of eye care systems where it is less dependent on human input, potentially enabling diagnosis to be cheaper, quicker, and more consistent. Although this technology will have a profound impact on clinical flow and practice patterns sooner or later, translating such a technology into clinical practice is challenging and requires similar levels of accountability and effectiveness as any new medication or medical device due to the potential problems of bias, and ethical, medical, and legal issues that might arise. The objective of this review is to summarize the opportunities and challenges of this transition and to facilitate the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into routine clinical practice based on our best understanding and experience in this area."
32694268,Artificial intelligence in ophthalmology during COVID-19 and in the post COVID-19 era,Joelle A Hallak,"Purpose of review: To highlight artificial intelligence applications in ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic that can be used to: describe ocular findings and changes correlated with COVID-19; extract information from scholarly articles on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 specific to ophthalmology; and implement efficient patient triage and telemedicine care. Recent findings: Ophthalmology has been leading in artificial intelligence and technology applications. With medical imaging analysis, pixel-annotated distinguishable features on COVID-19 patients may help with noninvasive diagnosis and severity outcome predictions. Using natural language processing (NLP) and data integration methods, topic modeling on more than 200 ophthalmology-related articles on COVID-19 can summarize ocular manifestations, viral transmission, treatment strategies, and patient care and practice management. Artificial intelligence for telemedicine applications can address the high demand, prioritize and triage patients, as well as improve at home-monitoring devices and secure data transfers. Summary: COVID-19 is significantly impacting the way we are delivering healthcare. Given the already successful implementation of artificial intelligence applications and telemedicine in ophthalmology, we expect that these systems will be embraced more as tools for research, education, and patient care."
32694266,Artificial intelligence for retinopathy of prematurity,Rebekah H Gensure,"Purpose of review: In this article, we review the current state of artificial intelligence applications in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and provide insight on challenges as well as strategies for bringing these algorithms to the bedside. Recent findings: In the past few years, there has been a dramatic shift from machine learning approaches based on feature extraction to 'deep' convolutional neural networks for artificial intelligence applications. Several artificial intelligence for ROP approaches have demonstrated adequate proof-of-concept performance in research studies. The next steps are to determine whether these algorithms are robust to variable clinical and technical parameters in practice. Integration of artificial intelligence into ROP screening and treatment is limited by generalizability of the algorithms to maintain performance on unseen data and integration of artificial intelligence technology into new or existing clinical workflows. Summary: Real-world implementation of artificial intelligence for ROP diagnosis will require massive efforts targeted at developing standards for data acquisition, true external validation, and demonstration of feasibility. We must now focus on ethical, technical, clinical, regulatory, and financial considerations to bring this technology to the infant bedside to realize the promise offered by this technology to reduce preventable blindness from ROP."
32694246,Computational Cytology: Lessons Learned from Pap Test Computer-Assisted Screening,Madelyn Lew,"Background: In the face of rapid technological advances in computational cytology including artificial intelligence (AI), optimization of its application to clinical practice would benefit from reflection on the lessons learned from the decades-long journey in the development of computer-assisted Pap test screening. Summary: The initial driving force for automated screening in cytology was the overwhelming number of Pap tests requiring manual screening, leading to workflow backlogs and incorrect diagnoses. Several companies invested resources to address these concerns utilizing different specimen processing techniques and imaging systems. However, not all companies were commercially prosperous. Successful implementation of this new technology required viable use cases, improved clinical outcomes, and an acceptable means of integration into the daily workflow of cytopathology laboratories. Several factors including supply and demand, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversight, reimbursement, overcoming learning curves and workflow changes associated with the adoption of new technology, and cytologist apprehension, played a significant role in either promoting or preventing the widespread adoption of automated screening technologies. Key Messages: Any change in health care, particularly those involving new technology that impacts clinical workflow, is bound to have its successes and failures. However, perseverance through learning curves, optimizing workflow processes, improvements in diagnostic accuracy, and regulatory and financial approval can facilitate widespread adoption of these technologies. Given their history with successfully implementing automated Pap test screening, cytologists are uniquely positioned to not only help with the development of AI technology for other areas of pathology, but also to guide how they are utilized, regulated, and managed."
32694210,Autonomics: In search of a foundation for next-generation autonomous systems,David Harel,"The potential benefits of autonomous systems are obvious. However, there are still major issues to be dealt with before developing such systems becomes a commonplace engineering practice, with accepted and trustworthy deliverables. We argue that a solid, evolving, publicly available, community-controlled foundation for developing next-generation autonomous systems is a must, and term the desired foundation ""autonomics."" We focus on three main challenges: 1) how to specify autonomous system behavior in the face of unpredictability; 2) how to carry out faithful analysis of system behavior with respect to rich environments that include humans, physical artifacts, and other systems; and 3) how to build such systems by combining executable modeling techniques from software engineering with artificial intelligence and machine learning."
32694195,Artificial intelligence or manufactured stupidity? The need for injury informaticians in the big data era,Kirsten Vallmuur,"The volume, velocity and variety of data collected about individuals have increased exponentially over the last decade, presenting new injury surveillance opportunities to identify risk factors, monitor trends, and evaluate the efficacy of interventions. But does the hype around big data and artificial intelligence (AI) apply to the injury prevention space, and how veracious is surveillance in this era? This commentary discusses the digital transformation of health as applied to injury prevention, but cautions on the challenges of maintaining data quality in integrated systems and discusses the need for an injury informatics strategy moving forward."
32692653,Determination of eccentric deposition thickness on offshore horizontal pipes by gamma-ray densitometry and artificial intelligence technique,Tâmara P Teixeira,"The extraction of oil is accompanied by water and sediments that, mixed with the oil, cause the formation of scale depositions in the pipelines walls promoting the reduction of the inner diameter of the pipes, making it difficult for the fluids to pass through interest. In this sense, there is a need to control the formation of these depositions to evaluate preventive and corrective measures regarding the waste management of these materials, as well as the optimization of oil extraction and transport processes. Noninvasive techniques such as gamma transmission and scattering can support the determination of the thickness of these deposits in pipes. This paper presents a novel methodology for prediction of scale with eccentric deposition in pipes used in the offshore oil industry and its approach is based on the principles of gamma densitometry and deep artificial neural networks (DNNs). To determine deposition thicknesses, a detection system has been developed that utilizes a 1 mm narrow beam geometry of collimation aperture comprising a source of 137Cs and three properly positioned 2″×2″ NaI(Tl) detectors around the system, pipe-scale-fluid. Crude oil was considered in the study, as well as eccentric deposits formed by barium sulfate, BaSO4. The theoretical models adopted a static flow regime and were developed using the MCNPX mathematical code and, secondly, used for the training and testing of the developed DNN model, a 7-layers deep rectifier neural network (DRNN). In addition, the hyperparameters of the DRNN were defined using a Baysian optimization method and its performance was validated via 10 experiments based on the K-Fold cross-validation technique. Following the proposed methodology, the DRNN was able to achieve, for the test sets (untrained samples), an average mean absolute error of 0.01734, mean absolute relative error of 0.29803% and R2 Score of 0.9998813 for the scale thickness prediction and an average accuracy of 100% for the scale position prediction. Therefore, the results show that the 7-layers DRNN presents good generalization capacity and is able to predict scale thickness with great precision, regardless of its position inside the tube."
32692088,Dysfunction of Empathy and Related Processes in Borderline Personality Disorder: A Systematic Review,Rui M Salgado,"After participating in this activity, learners should be better able to:• Assess differences between adult patients with the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and healthy control subjects in terms of empathy and related processes• Evaluate the effects of empathy or related processes as factors contributing to abnormal social functioning in BPD ABSTRACT: We reviewed 45 original research studies, published between 2000 and 2019, to assess differences between adult patients with the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and healthy control subjects in terms of empathy and related processes (i.e., theory of mind, mentalizing, social cognition, and emotional intelligence). Thirty-six studies reported deficits of empathy or related processes in patients with BPD. Enhanced emotional empathy in BPD was also reported in eight studies, all of which revealed that patients had increased scores of personal distress on the Interpersonal Reactivity Index self-report questionnaire. Six studies did not find significant differences between patients with BPD and healthy control subjects in terms of empathy or related processes. No study reported enhanced cognitive empathy, social cognition, or emotional intelligence in patients with BPD. We postulate that deficits of empathy or related processes contribute to preempting the formation of stable interpersonal relationships, whereas enhanced emotional empathy might lead to personal (and interpersonal) distress, further contributing to abnormal social functioning in BPD."
32691916,Fundamental insights on when social network data are most critical for conservation planning,Jonathan R Rhodes,"As declines in biodiversity accelerate, there is an urgent imperative to ensure that every dollar spent on conservation counts toward species protection. Systematic conservation planning is a widely used approach to achieve this, but there is growing concern that it must better integrate the human social dimensions of conservation to be effective. Yet, fundamental insights about when social data are most critical to inform conservation planning decisions are lacking. To address this problem, we derived novel principles to guide strategic investment in social network information for systematic conservation planning. We considered the common conservation problem of identifying which social actors, in a social network, to engage with to incentivize conservation behavior that maximizes the number of species protected. We used simulations of social networks and species distributed across network nodes to identify the optimal state-dependent strategies and the value of social network information. We did this for a range of motif network structures and species distributions and applied the approach to a small-scale fishery in Kenya. The value of social network information depended strongly on both the distribution of species and social network structure. When species distributions were highly nested (i.e., when species-poor sites are subsets of species-rich sites), the value of social network information was almost always low. This suggests that information on how species are distributed across a network is critical for determining whether to invest in collecting social network data. In contrast, the value of social network information was greatest when social networks were highly centralized. Results for the small-scale fishery were consistent with the simulations. Our results suggest that strategic collection of social network data should be prioritized when species distributions are un-nested and when social networks are likely to be centralized."
32691469,Existential Risks to Humanity Should Concern International Policymakers and More Could Be Done in Considering Them at the International Governance Level,Matt Boyd,"In this perspective, we consider the possible role of the United Nations (UN) with respect to existential risks to human civilization and the survival of humanity. We illustrate how existential risks have been discussed at an international governance level, specifically in documents in the UN Digital Library. In this large corpus, discussions of nuclear war account for over two-thirds (69%, 67/97) of mentions of existential risks, while mention of other existential risks, or such risks as a category, appears scant. We take these observations to imply inadequate attention to these significant threats. These deficits, combined with the need for a global response to many risks, suggest that UN member nations should urgently advocate for appropriate action at the UN to address threats, such as artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, geoengineering, and supervolcanic eruption, in analogous fashion to existing attempts to mitigate the threats from nuclear war or near-Earth objects."
32691284,Role of Parameter Setting in Electroacupuncture: Current Scenario and Future Prospects,Yuan-Yuan Zhang,"Acupuncture is an ancient therapeutic method based on the theory of Chinese medicine (CM). Traditional acupuncture has many limitations; it is subjective and relies more on the experience of an acupuncturist, and the efficacy is sometimes irreproducible. In contrast, electroacupuncture (EA) has special characteristics in terms of objectivity and stability, thereby gaining considerable attention. Parameter setting plays a crucial role in EA practice. The current paper summarizes the current situation and limitations of parameter setting in EA practice. Objectification is the tendency and future of CM as well as EA. With the development of computerized technologies, such as wearable sensors, vast data, and artificial intelligence, CM syndromes can be successfully objectified. We propose the development of a novel self-feedback-adjust EA system, which may improve the parameter setting in EA and be beneficial to both the patients and clinicians."
32691224,ODLURO syndrome: personal experience and review of the literature,Renata Conforti,"Introduction: The O'Donnell-Luria-Rodan (ODLURO) syndrome, caused by heterozygous mutation in the lysine N-methyltransferase2E (KMT2E) gene in chromosome 7q22, has been recently described. Mutation of KMT2E produces a protein-truncating variant gene that may be responsible for both developmental delay and intellectual disability disorders commonly defined by an Intelligence Quotient < 70 and usually unspecific pathologic brain features demonstrated by brain Magnetic Resonance imaging. The symptoms of ODLURO syndrome include variably developmental and speech delay, autism, seizures, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features. The aim of the study is to search for correlation between this specific gene mutation and clinical/radiological features, trying to provide new insights in this recently described pathological condition. Methods: We reviewed the 38 cases collected by O'Donnel-Luria et al., adding three cases of a familial heterozygosis novel mutation in KMT2E gene; different degrees of neurological disorder, subtle dysmorphic features, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and various brain Magnetic Resonance features are described. Results: Magnetic Resonance data were integrated by genetic analysis and clinical features. Brain Magnetic Resonance study of our patients confirmed peculiar pathologic features previously reported in ODLURO syndrome; cerebellar dysplasia was identified in one of them. All 3 patients had epilepsy, intellectual disability, and mild dysmorphisms. Conclusions: Our study adds 3 new patients genetically, clinically, and radiologically evaluated to the ODLURO syndrome case series. While CC hypoplasia and widening of subarachnoid spaces are already reported in literature, we document for the first time the presence of cerebellar dysplasia in ODLURO syndrome. We also highlight the extremely low IQ value and the presence of epilepsy in all 3 patients."
32691058,"Cortical Gyrification, Psychotic-Like Experiences, and Cognitive Performance in Nonclinical Subjects",Ulrika Evermann,"Background: Psychotic-like experiences (PLE) are present in nonclinical populations, yet their association with brain structural variation, especially markers of early neurodevelopment, is poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that cortical surface gyrification, a putative marker of early brain development, is associated with PLE in healthy subjects. Methods: We analyzed gyrification from 3 Tesla MRI scans (using CAT12 software) and PLE (positive, negative, and depressive symptom dimensions derived from the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences, CAPE) in 103 healthy participants (49 females, mean age 29.13 ± 9.37 years). A subsample of 63 individuals completed tasks from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and Controlled Oral Word Association Test. Estimated IQ and a composite neuropsychological score were used to explore mediation pathways via cognition. Results: Positive PLE distress was negatively associated with gyrification of the left precuneus. PLE depression dimension showed a negative association with gyrification in the right supramarginal and temporal region. There was no significant mediating effect of cognition on these associations. Conclusion: Our results support a neurobiological psychosis spectrum, for the first time linking an early developmental imaging marker (rather than volume) to dimensional subclinical psychotic symptoms. While schizophrenia risk, neurodevelopment, and cognitive function might share genetic risk factors, additional mediation analyses did not confirm a mediating effect of cognition on the gyrification-psychopathology correlation."
32690712,Relating size and functionality in human social networks through complexity,B J West,"Extensive empirical evidence suggests that there is a maximal number of people with whom an individual can maintain stable social relationships (the Dunbar number). We argue that this arises as a consequence of a natural phase transition in the dynamic self-organization among N individuals within a social system. We present the calculated size dependence of the scaling properties of complex social network models to argue that this collective behavior is an enhanced form of collective intelligence. Direct calculation establishes that the complexity of social networks as measured by their scaling behavior is nonmonotonic, peaking around 150, thereby providing a theoretical basis for the value of the Dunbar number. Thus, we establish a theory-based bridge spanning the gap between sociology and psychology."
32690046,Cognitive performance in children and adolescents at high-risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder,Elisa Teixeira Bernardes,"Background: Cognitive performance has been studied in adults with obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) and in adult relatives of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Meanwhile, few studies have been conducted with children under the same conditions. This study compared the neurocognitive domains previously associated with dysfunction in OCD, especially visuoconstructive ability, visuospatial memory, executive functions, and intelligence, in children and adolescents at high risk (HR) for OCD (n = 18) and non-OCD controls (NOC) (n = 31). Methods: For the HR group, we considered the first-degree relatives of patients with OCD that present OCS, but do not meet diagnostic criteria for OCD. Psychiatric diagnosis was assessed by experienced clinicians using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and OCS severity was measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Neurocognitive assessment was performed with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Performance on the cognitive domains was compared between groups using Multivariate Analysis of Variance, whereas performance on the neuropsychological variables was compared between groups using independent t-tests in a cognitive subdomain analysis. Results: The cognitive domain analysis revealed a trend towards significance for impairments in the motor and processing speed domain (p = 0.019; F = 3.12) in the HR group. Moreover, the cognitive subdomain analysis identified a statistically significant underperformance in spatial working memory in the HR group when compared to the NOC group (p = 0.005; t = - 2.94), and a trend towards significance for impairments in non-verbal memory and visuoconstructive tasks in the HR group. Conclusions: Our results suggest impairments in spatial working memory and motor and processing speed in a non-clinical sample of HR participants. Considering the preliminary nature of our findings, further studies investigating these neurocognitive domains as potential predictors of pediatric OCD are warranted."
32689983,What's in a name? A comparison of attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI) versus augmented human intelligence (AHI),Santiago Romero-Brufau,"Background: ""Artificial intelligence"" (AI) is often referred to as ""augmented human intelligence"" (AHI). The latter term implies that computers support-rather than replace-human decision-making. It is unclear whether the terminology used affects attitudes and perceptions in practice. Methods: In the context of a quality improvement project implementing AI/AHI-based decision support in a regional health system, we surveyed staff's attitudes about AI/AHI, randomizing question prompts to refer to either AI or AHI. Results: Ninety-three staff completed surveys. With a power of 0.95 to detect a difference larger than 0.8 points on a 5-point scale, we did not detect a significant difference in responses to six questions regarding attitudes when respondents were alternatively asked about AI versus AHI (mean difference range: 0.04-0.22 points; p > 0.05). Conclusion: Although findings may be setting-specific, we observed that use of the terms ""AI"" and ""AHI"" in a survey on attitudes of clinical staff elicited similar responses."
32689842,Neurolight: A Deep Learning Neural Interface for Cortical Visual Prostheses,Antonio Lozano,"Visual neuroprosthesis, that provide electrical stimulation along several sites of the human visual system, constitute a potential tool for vision restoration for the blind. Scientific and technological progress in the fields of neural engineering and artificial vision comes with new theories and tools that, along with the dawn of modern artificial intelligence, constitute a promising framework for the further development of neurotechnology. In the framework of the development of a Cortical Visual Neuroprosthesis for the blind (CORTIVIS), we are now facing the challenge of developing not only computationally powerful tools and flexible approaches that will allow us to provide some degree of functional vision to individuals who are profoundly blind. In this work, we propose a general neuroprosthesis framework composed of several task-oriented and visual encoding modules. We address the development and implementation of computational models of the firing rates of retinal ganglion cells and design a tool - Neurolight - that allows these models to be interfaced with intracortical microelectrodes in order to create electrical stimulation patterns that can evoke useful perceptions. In addition, the developed framework allows the deployment of a diverse array of state-of-the-art deep-learning techniques for task-oriented and general image pre-processing, such as semantic segmentation and object detection in our system's pipeline. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first deep-learning-based system designed to directly interface with the visual brain through an intracortical microelectrode array. We implement the complete pipeline, from obtaining a video stream to developing and deploying task-oriented deep-learning models and predictive models of retinal ganglion cells' encoding of visual inputs under the control of a neurostimulation device able to send electrical train pulses to a microelectrode array implanted at the visual cortex."
32688156,Exploring the multiscale hydrologic regulation of multipond systems in a humid agricultural catchment,Wenjun Chen,"Assessing the hydrologic processes over scales ranging from single wetland to regional is critical to understand the hydrologically-driven ecosystem services especially nutrient buffering of wetlands. Here, we present a novel approach to quantify the multiscale hydrologic regulation of multipond systems (MPSs), a common type of small, scattered wetland in humid agricultural regions, because previous studies have stopped in commending the catchment scale flood and drought resilience of these waters, and contemporary models do not adequately represent the corresponding intra-catchment fill-spill relationships. A new version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was developed to incorporate improved representation of: (1) perennial or intermittent spillage connections of pond-to-pond and pond-to-stream, and (2) bidirectional exchange between pond surface water and shallow groundwater. We present SWAT-MPS, which adopts rule-based artificial intelligence to model the possibilities of different spillage directions and GA-based parameter optimization over the two simulation years (June 2017 to May 2019), with successfully replicated streamflow and pond water-level variations in a 4.8 km2 test catchment, southern China. Water balance analysis and scenario simulations were then executed to assess the hydrologic regulation at single pond, single MPS, and entire catchment scales. Results revealed (1) the presence of 9 series- or series-parallel connected MPSs, in which pond overflow accounted for as much as 59% of the catchment water yield; (2) seasonally- and MPS-independent baseflow support and quickflow attenuation, with ranked level of pond water storage for baseflow support across different landuse types: forest > farm > village, and inversed correlation of pond spillage to baseflow and quickflow variations in the farmland; and (3) MPS-aggregated catchment flood peak reduction (>20%) and baseflow increment (26%) in the following dry days. Meteorological data analysis and simulated average daily values indicated these hydrologic patterns are credible even if extending to a 5-year period. As a first modelling attempt to explore the intra-catchment details of MPSs, our study underscores the water storage and connectivity in their hydrologic regulation, and suggests inventories, long-term field monitoring, and several research directions of the new model for integrated pond management in watersheds and river basins. These findings can inform refined assessment of similar small, scattered wetlands elsewhere, where restoration efforts are required."
32688106,The disruptive power of Artificial Intelligence. Ethical aspects of gerontechnology in elderly care,Giovanni Rubeis,"Gerontechnology based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to fulfill the promise of the so-called 4p-medicine and enable a predictive, personalized, preventive, and participatory elderly care. Although empirical evidence shows positive health outcomes, commentators are concerned that AI-based gerontechnology could bring along the disruption of elderly care. A systematic conceptualization of these concerns is lacking. In this paper, such a conceptualization is suggested by analyzing the risks of AI in elderly care as ""4d-risks"": the depersonalization of care through algorithm-based standardization, the discrimination of minority groups through generalization, the dehumanization of the care relationship through automatization, and the disciplination of users through monitoring and surveillance. Based on the 4d-model, strategies for a patient-centered AI in elderly care are outlined. Whether AI-based gerontechnology will actualize the 4p-perspective or bring about the 4d-scenario depends on whether joint efforts of users, caregivers, care providers, engineers, and policy makers will be made."
32687622,Effect of Twinning on Chinese and English Vocabulary Knowledge,Simpson W L Wong,"Vocabulary knowledge was tested in a native (Cantonese-Chinese) and foreign (English) language in 150 twins and 150 singletons aged 6-11 years, matched on age, gender, grade level, nonverbal intelligence, parents' education, family income, and number of siblings and household members. The singletons clearly outperformed the twins on the native vocabulary, but this ""twinning effect"" was much less noticeable for the foreign vocabulary. The effect on English vocabulary was further reduced after exposure to English at home was controlled. Given that these participants learned most of their English in school rather than home, the present findings support the notion that the twinning effect is associated with increased competition for family interaction in twins compared with singletons."
32687621,Culturally learned first impressions occur rapidly and automatically and emerge early in development,Adam Eggleston,"Previous research indicates that first impressions from faces are the products of automatic and rapid processing and emerge early in development. These features have been taken as evidence that first impressions have a phylogenetic origin. We examine whether first impressions acquired through learning can also possess these features. First, we confirm that adults rate a person as more intelligent when they are wearing glasses (Study 1). Next, we show this inference persists when participants are instructed to ignore the glasses (Study 2) and when viewing time is restricted to 100 ms (Study 3). Finally, we show that 6-year-old, but not 4-year-old, children perceive individuals wearing glasses to be more intelligent, indicating that the effect is seen relatively early in development (Study 4). These data indicate that automaticity, rapid access and early emergence are not evidence that first impressions have an innate origin. Rather, these features are equally compatible with a learning model."
32687477,Teleconsultation Between Patients and Health Care Professionals in the Catalan Primary Care Service: Message Annotation Analysis in a Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study,Francesc López Seguí,"Background: Over the last decade, telemedicine services have been introduced in the public health care systems of several industrialized countries. In Catalonia, the use of eConsulta, an asynchronous teleconsultation service between primary care professionals and citizens in the public health care system, has already reached 1 million cases. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of eConsulta was growing at a monthly rate of 7%, and the growth has been exponential from March 15, 2020 to the present day. Despite its widespread usage, there is little qualitative evidence describing how this tool is used. Objective: The aim of this study was to annotate a random sample of teleconsultations from eConsulta, and to evaluate the level of agreement between health care professionals with respect to the annotation. Methods: Twenty general practitioners retrospectively annotated a random sample of 5382 cases managed by eConsulta according to three aspects: the type of interaction according to 6 author-proposed categories, whether the practitioners believed a face-to-face visit was avoided, and whether they believed the patient would have requested a face-to-face visit had eConsulta not been available. A total of 1217 cases were classified three times by three different professionals to assess the degree of consensus among them. Results: The general practitioners considered that 79.60% (4284/5382) of the teleconsultations resulted in avoiding a face-to-face visit, and considered that 64.96% (3496/5382) of the time, the patient would have made a face-to-face visit in the absence of a service like eConsulta. The most frequent uses were for management of test results (26.77%, 1433/5354), management of repeat prescriptions (24.30%, 1301/5354), and medical enquiries (14.23%, 762/5354). The degree of agreement among professionals as to the annotations was mixed, with the highest consensus demonstrated for the question ""Has the online consultation avoided a face-to-face visit?"" (3/3 professionals agreed 67.95% of the time, 827/1217), and the lowest consensus for the type of use of the teleconsultation (3/3 professionals agreed 57.60% of the time, 701/1217). Conclusions: This study shows the ability of eConsulta to reduce the number of face-to-face visits for 55% (79% × 65%) to 79% of cases. In comparison to previous research, these results are slightly more pessimistic, although the rates are still high and in line with administrative data proxies, showing that 84% of patients using teleconsultations do not make an in-person appointment in the following 3 months. With respect to the type of consultation performed, our results are similar to the existing literature, thus providing robust support for eConsulta's usage. The mixed degree of consensus among professionals implies that results derived from artificial intelligence tools such as message classification algorithms should be interpreted in light of these shortcomings."
32686931,"Strengthened, Antibacterial, and Conductive Flexible Film for Humidity and Strain Sensors",Chuanhui Xu,"With the development of artificial intelligence, people are not satisfied with the traditional conductive materials and tend to focus on stretchable and flexible electronic systems. Flexible conductive rubbers have great potential applications in wearable strain sensors. However, the rapid propagation of bacteria during the use of wearable sensors may be an ineluctable threat to humans' health. Herein, a conductive rubber film is fabricated based on carboxylic styrene-butadiene rubber (XSBR), citric acid (CA), and silver nitrate (AgNO3) via a convenient approach, where Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are in situ reduced without sintering at elevated temperatures. The resultant films exhibit many desirable and impressive features, such as strengthened mechanical properties, flexibility, and conductivity. More importantly, the Ag NP flexible conductive films exhibit excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (Gram-negative bacteria) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria), which have potential applications as flexible antibacterial materials to monitor movements of the human body in real time. Also, because of the hygroscopicity of CA, the resistance of our conductive film is sensitive to various humidities, which can be applied in the humidity sensor."
32686740,"Good neighbors, bad neighbors: the frequent network neighborhood mapping of the hippocampus enlightens several structural factors of the human intelligence on a 414-subject cohort",Máté Fellner,"The human connectome has become the very frequent subject of study of brain-scientists, psychologists and imaging experts in the last decade. With diffusion magnetic resonance imaging techniques, united with advanced data processing algorithms, today we are able to compute braingraphs with several hundred, anatomically identified nodes and thousands of edges, corresponding to the anatomical connections of the brain. The analysis of these graphs without refined mathematical tools is hopeless. These tools need to address the high error rate of the MRI processing workflow, and need to find structural causes or at least correlations of psychological properties and cerebral connections. Until now, structural connectomics was only rarely able of identifying such causes or correlations. In the present work we study the frequent neighbor sets of the most deeply investigated brain area, the hippocampus. By applying the Frequent Network Neighborhood mapping method, we identified frequent neighbor-sets of the hippocampus, which may influence numerous psychological parameters, including intelligence-related ones. We have found ""Good Neighbor"" sets, which correlate with better test results and also ""Bad Neighbor"" sets, which correlate with worse test results. Our study utilizes the braingraphs, computed from the imaging data of the Human Connectome Project's 414 subjects, each with 463 anatomically identified nodes."
32686642,Interventions based on early intensive applied behaviour analysis for autistic children: a systematic review and cost-effectiveness analysis,Mark Rodgers,"Background: Early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions are intensive interventions for autistic children that are often delivered on a one-to-one basis for 20-50 hours per week. Objectives: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions for autistic children, based on current evidence. Methods: A systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of an early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based intervention for autistic children. An economic analysis included a review of existing analyses and the development of a new model. Results: Twenty studies were included in the clinical review. Individual participant data were retrieved from 15 of these studies. Results favoured the interventions when assessing adaptive behaviour after 2 years compared with treatment as usual/eclectic interventions (mean difference 7.00, 95% confidence interval 1.95 to 12.06). In analyses of cognitive ability (intelligence quotient), results favoured the interventions by approximately 10 points after 1 year (mean difference 9.16, 95% confidence interval 4.38 to 13.93) and 2 years (mean difference 14.13, 95% confidence interval 9.16 to 19.10). Evidence for other outcomes was limited and meta-analyses were generally inconclusive. There was no evidence that the effect of the interventions varied with characteristics of the children, but data were limited. Adopting a £30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year threshold, the results of the cost-effectiveness analysis indicate that early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions would need to generate larger benefits or cost savings to be cost-effective. Adopting a public sector perspective and making pessimistic assumptions about long-term effects, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based therapy compared with treatment as usual is £189,122 per quality-adjusted life-year. When optimistic assumptions are made, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is £46,768 per quality-adjusted life-year. Scenario analyses indicated that these interventions can potentially be cost-effective if long-term improvements persist into adulthood, or if they have significant impact on educational placement. Care should be taken when interpreting these scenarios owing to the limited data. Limitations: All included studies were at risk of bias, there was substantial heterogeneity and effects varied considerably across studies. The effect of intervention on autism symptom severity, language development and school placement remains uncertain because of the limited data. The long-term effects are unclear owing to a lack of follow-up data. Conclusions: This review found limited evidence that early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions may improve cognitive ability and adaptive behaviour, but the long-term impact of the interventions remains unknown. The economic analysis is constrained by the limited effectiveness evidence, but suggests that these interventions are unlikely to be cost-effective unless clear long-term benefits, or a substantial change in which schools children attend, can be identified. Future work: Further studies into the effectiveness of early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions may be warranted if they include well-defined, alternative interventions as comparators and collect relevant outcomes. Consideration should be given to future studies that not only address whether or not early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions are clinically effective, but also aim to identify which components of early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions might drive effectiveness.

32686506,Virtual care: Enhancing access or harming care?,Lorian Hardcastle,"COVID-19 has catalyzed the adoption of virtual medical care in Canada. Virtual care can improve access to healthcare services, particularly for those in remote locations or with health conditions that make seeing a doctor in person difficult or unsafe. However, virtual walk-in clinic models that do not connect patients with their own doctors can lead to fragmented, lower quality care. Although virtual walk-in clinics can be helpful for those who temporarily lack access to a family doctor, they should not be relied on as a long-term substitute to an established relationship with a primary care provider. Virtual care also raises significant privacy issues that policy-makers must address prior to implementing these models. Patients should be cautious of the artificial intelligence recommendations generated by some virtual care applications, which have been linked to quality of care concerns."
32686236,"The continuous development of a complete and objective automatic grading system of facial signs from selfie pictures: Asian validation study and application to women of three ethnic origins, differently aged",Frederic Flament,"Objective: To evaluate the capacity of the automatic detection system to accurately grade, from smartphones' selfie pictures, the severity of seven new facial signs added to the nine previously integrated. Methods: A two-step approach was conducted: first, to check on 112 Korean women, how the AI-based automatic grading system may correlate with dermatological assessments, taken as reference; second, to confirm on 1140 women of three ancestries (African, Asian, and Caucasian) the relevance of the newly input facial signs. Results: The sixteen specific Asian facial signs, detected automatically, were found significantly (P < .0001) highly correlated with the clinical evaluations made by two Korean dermatologists (wrinkles: r = .90; sagging: r = .75-.95; vascular: r = .85; pores: r = .60; pigmentation: r = .50-.80). When applied at a larger scale on women of different ethnicities, new signs were found of good accuracy and reproducibility, albeit depending on ethnicity. Due to contrast with the innate skin complexion, the facial signs dealing with skin pigmentation were found of a much higher relevance among Asian women than African or Caucasian women. The automatic gradings were even found of a slightly higher accuracy than the clinical gradings. Conclusion: The previously used automatic grading system is now completed by adding new facial signs apt at being detected. The continuous development is now integrating some limitations with regard to the constitutive skin complexion of the self-pictured subjects. Presenting reproducible assessments, highly correlated with medical grading, this system could change tremendously clinical researches, like in epidemiological studies, where it offers an easy, fast, affordable, and confidential approach in the objective quantification of facial signs."
32686118,Synthesis of diagnostic quality cancer pathology images by generative adversarial networks,Adrian B Levine,"Deep learning-based computer vision methods have recently made remarkable breakthroughs in the analysis and classification of cancer pathology images. However, there has been relatively little investigation of the utility of deep neural networks to synthesize medical images. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of generative adversarial networks to synthesize high-resolution pathology images of 10 histological types of cancer, including five cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the five major histological subtypes of ovarian carcinoma. The quality of these images was assessed using a comprehensive survey of board-certified pathologists (n = 9) and pathology trainees (n = 6). Our results show that the real and synthetic images are classified by histotype with comparable accuracies and the synthetic images are visually indistinguishable from real images. Furthermore, we trained deep convolutional neural networks to diagnose the different cancer types and determined that the synthetic images perform as well as additional real images when used to supplement a small training set. These findings have important applications in proficiency testing of medical practitioners and quality assurance in clinical laboratories. Furthermore, training of computer-aided diagnostic systems can benefit from synthetic images where labeled datasets are limited (e.g. rare cancers). We have created a publicly available website where clinicians and researchers can attempt questions from the image survey (http://gan.aimlab.ca/). © 2020 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

32686045,Implementation of data intelligence models coupled with ensemble machine learning for prediction of water quality index,Sani Isah Abba,"In recent decades, various conventional techniques have been formulated around the world to evaluate the overall water quality (WQ) at particular locations. In the present study, back propagation neural network (BPNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector regression (SVR), and one multilinear regression (MLR) are considered for the prediction of water quality index (WQI) at three stations, namely Nizamuddin, Palla, and Udi (Chambal), across the Yamuna River, India. The nonlinear ensemble technique was proposed using the neural network ensemble (NNE) approach to improve the performance accuracy of the single models. The observed WQ parameters were provided by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) including dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, biological oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia (NH3), temperature (T), and WQI. The performance of the models was evaluated by various statistical indices. The obtained results indicated the feasibility of the developed data intelligence models for predicting the WQI at the three stations with the superior modelling results of the NNE. The results also showed that the minimum values for root mean square (RMS) varied between 0.1213 and 0.4107, 0.003 and 0.0367, and 0.002 and 0.0272 for Nizamuddin, Palla, and Udi (Chambal), respectively. ANFIS-M3, BPNN-M4, and BPNN-M3 improved the performance with regard to an absolute error by 41%, 4%, and 3%, over other models for Nizamuddin, Palla, and Udi (Chambal) stations, respectively. The predictive comparison demonstrated that NNE proved to be effective and can therefore serve as a reliable prediction approach. The inferences of this paper would be of interest to policymakers in terms of WQ for establishing sustainable management strategies of water resources."
32685682,How to measure the collective intelligence of primary healthcare teams?,Emmanuelle Jean,"Introduction: The capacity for teams and organizations to evolve and to thrive in ever-shifting environments is attributed to their collective intelligence. Collectively, intelligent team could prevent repetition of past mistakes and can help organizations and people work more efficiently. Researchers aimed to find a framework or a tool that could help explain collective intelligence in primary healthcare organizations. Methods: The framework was developed iteratively following a three-step process based on the Pragmatic utility concept analysis, each step fetching data from both literature and the team's expertise: (i) finding an existing framework, (ii) developing an initial framework, (iii) testing and refining the framework. Results: A broad literature search led researchers to focus more specifically on two interrelated frameworks, both concepts were created within the educational field. We first adapted these concepts to healthcare teams, then to the increasing interdisciplinarity of primary healthcare teams. We also subdivided the framework into clinical or organizational domain. Finally, we performed a secondary analysis from existing data of a larger project that aimed to evaluate seven primary care teams in Quebec. Conclusions: This first attempt to conceptualize collective intelligence in a way that is specific to primary healthcare teams helps identify strengths and areas in which teams could potentially improve. From a theoretical perspective, the framework facilitates understanding of the concept of collective intelligence in primary healthcare teams. Our current results show a strong potential for this tool, but other tests and systematic validations are to be expected in order to better link collective intelligence and team performance."
32685470,An Artificial Intelligence Model for Predicting 1-Year Survival of Bone Metastases in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients Based on XGBoost Algorithm,Zhangheng Huang,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients often develop bone metastases (BM), and the overall survival for these patients is usually perishing. However, a model with high accuracy for predicting the survival of NSCLC with BM is still lacking. Here, we aimed to establish a model based on artificial intelligence for predicting the 1-year survival rate of NSCLC with BM by using extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), a large-scale machine learning algorithm. We selected NSCLC patients with BM between 2010 and 2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. In total, 5973 cases were enrolled and divided into the training (n = 4183) and validation (n = 1790) sets. XGBoost, random forest, support vector machine, and logistic algorithms were used to generate predictive models. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate and compare the predictive performance of each model. The parameters including tumor size, age, race, sex, primary site, histological subtype, grade, laterality, T stage, N stage, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, distant metastases to other sites (lung, brain, and liver), and marital status were selected to construct all predictive models. The XGBoost model had a better performance in both training and validation sets as compared with other models in terms of accuracy. Our data suggested that the XGBoost model is the most precise and personalized tool for predicting the 1-year survival rate for NSCLC patients with BM. This model can help the clinicians to design more rational and effective therapeutic strategies."
32685026,Urine biopsy technologies: Cancer and beyond,Chun Kwan Chen,"Since the discovery of circulating tumor cells in 1869, technological advances in the study of biomarkers from liquid biopsy have made it possible to diagnose disease in a less invasive way. Although blood-based liquid biopsy has been used extensively for the detection of solid tumors and immune diseases, the potential of urine-based liquid biopsy has not been fully explored. Advancements in technologies for the harvesting and analysis of biomarkers are providing new opportunities for the characterization of other disease types. Liquid biopsy markers such as exfoliated bladder cancer cells, cell-free DNA (cfDNA), and exosomes have the potential to change the nature of disease management and care, as they allow a cost-effective and convenient mode of patient monitoring throughout treatment. In this review, we addressed the advancement of research in the field of disease detection for the key liquid biopsy markers such as cancer cells, cfDNA, and exosomes, with an emphasis on urine-based liquid biopsy. First, we highlighted key technologies that were widely available and used extensively for clinical urine sample analysis. Next, we presented recent technological developments in cell and genetic research, with implications for the detection of other types of diseases, besides cancer. We then concluded with some discussions on these areas, emphasizing the role of microfluidics and artificial intelligence in advancing point-of-care applications. We believe that the benefits of urine biopsy provide diagnostic development potential, which will pave opportunities for new ways to guide treatment selections and facilitate precision disease therapies."
32684808,The Predictor Role of Perceived Social Support and Spiritual Intelligence in Hope Among Thalassemia Patients,Nilofar Pasyar,"Background: Thalassemia is a prevalent chronic blood disorder, which is accompanied with a wide range of challenges. This study aimed to determine the predictor role of perceived social support and spiritual intelligence in hope among thalassemia patients. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 300 thalassemia patients. The data were collected using Miller hope scale, spiritual intelligence scale, and personal resource questionnaire. The data were analysed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and multiple regression analysis. Results: The results indicated that the mean score of hope was 173.38 (standard deviation [SD] = 24.6). Besides, 86.7% of the patients showed high levels of hope. The mean score of spiritual intelligence was 134.66 (SD = 18.07). In addition, 91.7% of the patients showed moderate levels of spiritual intelligence. The mean score of social support was 127.87 (SD = 20.19) and the patients showed high social support levels. The results revealed a significant association between hope and perceived social support (r = 0.65, P < 0.001) as well as between hope and spiritual intelligence (r = 0.63, P < 0.001). Moreover, perceived social support (b = 0.43, P < 0.001) and spiritual intelligence (b = 0.37, P < 0.001) were the predictors of hope among thalassemia patients. Conclusion: Considering the study results, in addition to common treatments for thalassemia, policymakers' are recommended to pay attention to spiritual intelligence and more importantly social support to enhance thalassemia patients' hope."
32684597,Diagnosing Heart Failure from Chest X-Ray Images Using Deep Learning,Takuya Matsumoto,"The development of deep learning technology has enabled machines to achieve high-level accuracy in interpreting medical images. While many previous studies have examined the detection of pulmonary nodules in chest X-rays using deep learning, the application of this technology to heart failure remains rare. In this paper, we investigated the performance of a deep learning algorithm in terms of diagnosing heart failure using images obtained from chest X-rays. We used 952 chest X-ray images from a labeled database published by the National Institutes of Health. Two cardiologists verified and relabeled a total of 260 ""normal"" and 378 ""heart failure"" images, with the remainder being discarded because they had been incorrectly labeled. Data augmentation and transfer learning were used to obtain an accuracy of 82% in diagnosing heart failure using the chest X-ray images. Furthermore, heatmap imaging allowed us to visualize decisions made by the machine. Deep learning can thus help support the diagnosis of heart failure using chest X-ray images."
32684141,Clot-Based Radiomics Predict a Mechanical Thrombectomy Strategy for Successful Recanalization in Acute Ischemic Stroke,Jeremy Hofmeister,"Background and purpose: Mechanical thrombectomy (MTB) is a reference treatment for acute ischemic stroke, with several endovascular strategies currently available. However, no quantitative methods are available for the selection of the best endovascular strategy or to predict the difficulty of clot removal. We aimed to investigate the predictive value of an endovascular strategy based on radiomic features extracted from the clot on preinterventional, noncontrast computed tomography to identify patients with first-attempt recanalization with thromboaspiration and to predict the overall number of passages needed with an MTB device for successful recanalization. Methods: We performed a study including 2 cohorts of patients admitted to our hospital: a retrospective training cohort (n=109) and a prospective validation cohort (n=47). Thrombi were segmented on noncontrast computed tomography, followed by the automatic computation of 1485 thrombus-related radiomic features. After selection of the relevant features, 2 machine learning models were developed on the training cohort to predict (1) first-attempt recanalization with thromboaspiration and (2) the overall number of passages with MTB devices for successful recanalization. The performance of the models was evaluated on the prospective validation cohort. Results: A small subset of radiomic features (n=9) was predictive of first-attempt recanalization with thromboaspiration (receiver operating characteristic curve-area under the curve, 0.88). The same subset also predicted the overall number of passages required for successful recanalization (explained variance, 0.70; mean squared error, 0.76; Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.73; P<0.05). Conclusions: Clot-based radiomics have the ability to predict an MTB strategy for successful recanalization in acute ischemic stroke, thus allowing a potentially better selection of the MTB strategy, as well as patients who are most likely to benefit from the intervention."
32683817,Development of the Korean Developmental Screening Test for Infants and Children (K-DST),Hee Jung Chung,"Background: Most developmental screening tools in Korea are adopted from foreign tests. To ensure efficient screening of infants and children in Korea, a nationwide screening tool with high reliability and validity is needed. Purpose: This study aimed to independently develop, standardize, and validate the Korean Developmental Screening Test for Infants and Children (K-DST) for screening infants and children for neurodevelopmental disorders in Korea. Methods: The standardization and validation conducted in 2012-2014 of 3,284 subjects (4-71 months of age) resulted in the first edition of the K-DST. The restandardization and revalidation performed in 2015-2016 of 3.06 million attendees of the National Health Screening Program for Infants and Children resulted in the revised K-DST. We analyzed inter-item consistency and test-retest reliability for the reliability analysis. Regarding the validation of K-DST, we examined the construct validity, sensitivity and specificity, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and a criterion-related validity analysis. Results: We ultimately selected 8 questions in 6 developmental domains. For most age groups and each domain, internal consistency was 0.73-0.93 and test-retest reliability was 0.77-0.88. The revised K-DST had high discriminatory ability with a sensitivity of 0.833 and specificity of 0.979. The test supported construct validity by distinguishing between normal and neurodevelopmentally delayed groups. The language and cognition domain of the revised K-DST was highly correlated with the K-Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II's Mental Age Quotient (r=0.766, 0.739), while the gross and fine motor domains were highly correlated with Motor Age Quotient (r=0.695, 0.668), respectively. The Verbal Intelligence Quotient of Korean Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence was highly correlated with the K-DST cognition and language domains (r=0.701, 0.770), as was the performance intelligence quotient with the fine motor domain (r=0.700). Conclusion: The K-DST is reliable and valid, suggesting its good potential as an effective screening tool for infants and children with neurodevelopmental disorders in Korea."
32683774,Monitoring online media reports for early detection of unknown diseases: Insight from a retrospective study of COVID-19 emergence,Sarah Valentin,"Event-based surveillance (EBS) systems monitor a broad range of information sources to detect early signals of disease emergence, including new and unknown diseases. In December 2019, a newly identified coronavirus emerged in Wuhan (China), causing a global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the capacity of three event-based surveillance (EBS) systems (ProMED, HealthMap and PADI-web) to detect early COVID-19 emergence signals. We focused on changes in online news vocabulary over the period before/after the identification of COVID-19, while also assessing its contagiousness and pandemic potential. ProMED was the timeliest EBS, detecting signals one day before the official notification. At this early stage, the specific vocabulary used was related to 'pneumonia symptoms' and 'mystery illness'. Once COVID-19 was identified, the vocabulary changed to virus family and specific COVID-19 acronyms. Our results suggest that the three EBS systems are complementary regarding data sources, and all require timeliness improvements. EBS methods should be adapted to the different stages of disease emergence to enhance early detection of future unknown disease outbreaks."
32683550,From community-acquired pneumonia to COVID-19: a deep learning-based method for quantitative analysis of COVID-19 on thick-section CT scans,Zhang Li,"Objective: To develop a fully automated AI system to quantitatively assess the disease severity and disease progression of COVID-19 using thick-section chest CT images. Methods: In this retrospective study, an AI system was developed to automatically segment and quantify the COVID-19-infected lung regions on thick-section chest CT images. Five hundred thirty-one CT scans from 204 COVID-19 patients were collected from one appointed COVID-19 hospital. The automatically segmented lung abnormalities were compared with manual segmentation of two experienced radiologists using the Dice coefficient on a randomly selected subset (30 CT scans). Two imaging biomarkers were automatically computed, i.e., the portion of infection (POI) and the average infection HU (iHU), to assess disease severity and disease progression. The assessments were compared with patient status of diagnosis reports and key phrases extracted from radiology reports using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Cohen's kappa, respectively. Results: The dice coefficient between the segmentation of the AI system and two experienced radiologists for the COVID-19-infected lung abnormalities was 0.74 ± 0.28 and 0.76 ± 0.29, respectively, which were close to the inter-observer agreement (0.79 ± 0.25). The computed two imaging biomarkers can distinguish between the severe and non-severe stages with an AUC of 0.97 (p value < 0.001). Very good agreement (κ = 0.8220) between the AI system and the radiologists was achieved on evaluating the changes in infection volumes. Conclusions: A deep learning-based AI system built on the thick-section CT imaging can accurately quantify the COVID-19-associated lung abnormalities and assess the disease severity and its progressions. Key points: • A deep learning-based AI system was able to accurately segment the infected lung regions by COVID-19 using the thick-section CT scans (Dice coefficient ≥ 0.74). • The computed imaging biomarkers were able to distinguish between the non-severe and severe COVID-19 stages (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.97). • The infection volume changes computed by the AI system were able to assess the COVID-19 progression (Cohen's kappa 0.8220)."

32683220,"Prediction of neuropathy, neuropathic pain and kinesiophobia in patients with type 2 diabetes and design of computerized clinical decision support systems by using artificial intelligence",Filiz Ozdemir,"Exercise is a key component for prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, diabetes complications affect exercise habits. Computerized clinical decision support systems (CCDSSs) may help specialists improve their decision-making abilities in the management of diseases. We hypothesized that patients' diabetic neuropathy, neuropathic pain, and kinesiophobia will quickly be identified in the early stages by using the designed CCDSSs. It is thought that such systems will help in planning exercise programs for patients with diabetes and in maintaining the appropriate programs. Based on our hypothesis, we conclude that CCDSSs will also be effective in managing complications and movement dysfunctions occurring in the musculoskeletal system."
32682317,Classification of glomerular pathological findings using deep learning and nephrologist-AI collective intelligence approach,Eiichiro Uchino,"Background: Automated classification of glomerular pathological findings is potentially beneficial in establishing an efficient and objective diagnosis in renal pathology. While previous studies have verified the artificial intelligence (AI) models for the classification of global sclerosis and glomerular cell proliferation, there are several other glomerular pathological findings required for diagnosis, and the comprehensive models for the classification of these major findings have not yet been reported. Whether the cooperation between these AI models and clinicians improves diagnostic performance also remains unknown. Here, we developed AI models to classify glomerular images for major findings required for pathological diagnosis and investigated whether those models could improve the diagnostic performance of nephrologists. Methods: We used a dataset of 283 kidney biopsy cases comprising 15,888 glomerular images that were annotated by a total of 25 nephrologists. AI models to classify seven pathological findings: global sclerosis, segmental sclerosis, endocapillary proliferation, mesangial matrix accumulation, mesangial cell proliferation, crescent, and basement membrane structural changes, were constructed using deep learning by fine-tuning of InceptionV3 convolutional neural network. Subsequently, we compared the agreement to truth labels between majority decision among nephrologists with or without the AI model as a voter. Results: Our model for global sclerosis showed high performance (area under the curve: periodic acid-Schiff, 0.986; periodic acid methenamine silver, 0.983); the models for the other findings also showed performance close to those of nephrologists. By adding the AI model output to majority decision among nephrologists, out of the 14 constructed models, the results of the majority decision showed improvement in sensitivity for 10 models (four of them were statistically significant) and specificity for eight models (five significant). Conclusion: Our study showed a proof-of-concept for the classification of multiple glomerular findings in a comprehensive method of deep learning and suggested its potential effectiveness in improving diagnostic accuracy of clinicians."
32682191,Medical data science in rhinology: Background and implications for clinicians,Young Joon Jun,"Background: An important challenge of big data is using complex information networks to provide useful clinical information. Recently, machine learning, and particularly deep learning, has enabled rapid advances in clinical practice. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in rhinology is an increasingly relevant topic. Purpose: We review the literature and provide a detailed overview of the recent advances in AI and ML as applied to rhinology. Also, we discuss both the significant benefits of this work as well as the challenges in the implementation and acceptance of these methods for clinical purposes. Methods: We aimed to identify and explain published studies on the use of AI and ML in rhinology based on PubMed, Scopus, and Google searches. The search string ""nasal OR respiratory AND artificial intelligence OR machine learning"" was used. Most of the studies covered areas of paranasal sinuses radiology, including allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinitis, computed tomography scans, and nasal cytology. Results: Cluster analysis and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were mainly used in studies related to rhinology. AI is increasingly affecting healthcare research, and ML technology has been used in studies of chronic rhinitis and allergic rhinitis, providing some exciting new research modalities. Conclusion: AI is especially useful when there is no conclusive evidence to aid decision making. ML can help doctors make clinical decisions, but it does not entirely replace doctors. However, when critically evaluating studies using this technique, rhinologists must take into account the limitations of its applications and use."
32681536,Application of artificial intelligence using a convolutional neural network for diagnosis of early gastric cancer based on magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging,Hiroya Ueyama,"Background and aim: Magnifying endoscopy with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI) has made a huge contribution to clinical practice. However, acquiring skill at ME-NBI diagnosis of early gastric cancer (EGC) requires considerable expertise and experience. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI), using deep learning and a convolutional neural network (CNN), has made remarkable progress in various medical fields. Here, we constructed an AI-assisted CNN computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system, based on ME-NBI images, to diagnose EGC and evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the AI-assisted CNN-CAD system. Methods: The AI-assisted CNN-CAD system (ResNet50) was trained and validated on a dataset of 5574 ME-NBI images (3797 EGCs, 1777 non-cancerous mucosa and lesions). To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, a separate test dataset of 2300 ME-NBI images (1430 EGCs, 870 non-cancerous mucosa and lesions) was assessed using the AI-assisted CNN-CAD system. Results: The AI-assisted CNN-CAD system required 60 s to analyze 2300 test images. The overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the CNN were 98.7%, 98%, 100%, 100%, and 96.8%, respectively. All misdiagnosed images of EGCs were of low-quality or of superficially depressed and intestinal-type intramucosal cancers that were difficult to distinguish from gastritis, even by experienced endoscopists. Conclusions: The AI-assisted CNN-CAD system for ME-NBI diagnosis of EGC could process many stored ME-NBI images in a short period of time and had a high diagnostic ability. This system may have great potential for future application to real clinical settings, which could facilitate ME-NBI diagnosis of EGC in practice."
32681210,Efficacy of intelligent diagnosis with a dynamic uncertain causality graph model for rare disorders of sex development,Dongping Ning,"Disorders of sex development (DSD) are a group of rare complex clinical syndromes with multiple etiologies. Distinguishing the various causes of DSD is quite difficult in clinical practice, even for senior general physicians because of the similar and atypical clinical manifestations of these conditions. In addition, DSD are difficult to diagnose because most primary doctors receive insufficient training for DSD. Delayed diagnoses and misdiagnoses are common for patients with DSD and lead to poor treatment and prognoses. On the basis of the principles and algorithms of dynamic uncertain causality graph (DUCG), a diagnosis model for DSD was jointly constructed by experts on DSD and engineers of artificial intelligence. ""Chaining"" inference algorithm and weighted logic operation mechanism were applied to guarantee the accuracy and efficiency of diagnostic reasoning under incomplete situations and uncertain information. Verification was performed using 153 selected clinical cases involving nine common DSD-related diseases and three causes other than DSD as the differential diagnosis. The model had an accuracy of 94.1%, which was significantly higher than that of interns and third-year residents. In conclusion, the DUCG model has broad application prospects as a computer-aided diagnostic tool for DSD-related diseases."
32681001,A solution to the learning dilemma for recurrent networks of spiking neurons,Guillaume Bellec,"Recurrently connected networks of spiking neurons underlie the astounding information processing capabilities of the brain. Yet in spite of extensive research, how they can learn through synaptic plasticity to carry out complex network computations remains unclear. We argue that two pieces of this puzzle were provided by experimental data from neuroscience. A mathematical result tells us how these pieces need to be combined to enable biologically plausible online network learning through gradient descent, in particular deep reinforcement learning. This learning method-called e-prop-approaches the performance of backpropagation through time (BPTT), the best-known method for training recurrent neural networks in machine learning. In addition, it suggests a method for powerful on-chip learning in energy-efficient spike-based hardware for artificial intelligence."
32680766,Prospective Analysis Using a Novel CNN Algorithm to Distinguish Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia From Ductal Carcinoma in Situ in Breast,Simukayi Mutasa,"Introduction: We previously developed a convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based algorithm to distinguish atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) using a mammographic dataset. The purpose of this study is to further validate our CNN algorithm by prospectively analyzing an unseen new dataset to evaluate the diagnostic performance of our algorithm. Materials and methods: In this institutional review board-approved study, a new dataset composed of 280 unique mammographic images from 140 patients was used to test our CNN algorithm. All patients underwent stereotactic-guided biopsy of calcifications and underwent surgical excision with available final pathology. The ADH group consisted of 122 images from 61 patients with the highest pathology diagnosis of ADH. The DCIS group consisted of 158 images from 79 patients with the highest pathology diagnosis of DCIS. Two standard mammographic magnification views (craniocaudal and mediolateral/lateromedial) of the calcifications were used for analysis. Calcifications were segmented using an open source software platform 3D slicer and resized to fit a 128 × 128 pixel bounding box. Our previously developed CNN algorithm was used. Briefly, a 15 hidden layer topology was used. The network architecture contained 5 residual layers and dropout of 0.25 after each convolution. Diagnostic performance metrics were analyzed including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The ""positive class"" was defined as the pure ADH group in this study and thus specificity represents minimizing the amount of falsely labeled pure ADH cases. Results: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.90 (95% confidence interval, ± 0.04). Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity was 80.7%, 63.9%, and 93.7%, respectively. Conclusion: Prospectively tested on new unseen data, our CNN algorithm distinguished pure ADH from DCIS using mammographic images with high specificity."
32680632,Medical Student Perspectives on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Practice of Medicine,Christian J Park,"Introduction: Concerns about radiologists being replaced by artificial intelligence (AI) from the lay media could have a negative impact on medical students' perceptions of radiology as a viable specialty. The purpose of this study was to evaluate United States of America medical students' perceptions about radiology and other medical specialties in relation to AI. Methods: An anonymous, web-based survey was sent to 32 radiology interest groups at United States medical schools. The survey was comprised of 6 questions assessing medical student perceptions of AI and its potential impact on radiology and other medical specialties. Responses were voluntary and collected over a 6-month period from November 2017 to April 2018. Results: A total of 156 students responded with representation from each year of medical school. Over 75% agreed that AI would have a significant role in the future of medicine. Most (66%) agreed that diagnostic radiology would be the specialty most greatly affected. Nearly half (44%) reported that AI made them less enthusiastic about radiology. The majority of students (57%) obtained their information about AI from online articles. Thematic analysis of free answer comments revealed mostly neutral comments towards AI, however, the negative responses were the strongest and most detailed. Conclusions: US medical students believe that AI will play a significant role in medicine, particularly in radiology. However, nearly half are less enthusiastic about the field of radiology due to AI. As the majority receive information about AI from online articles, which may have negative sentiments towards AI's impact on radiology, formal AI education and medical student outreach may help combat misinformation and help prevent the dissuading of medical students who might otherwise consider the specialty."
32679653,Linking Cooperative Learning and Emotional Intelligence in Physical Education: Transition across School Stages,Sergio Rivera-Pérez,"The present research had two complementary aims: (a) to examine the associations between cooperative learning (CL) and emotional intelligence (EI) in physical education (PE) and (b) to explore and compare the use of CL in PE in primary education (PED), secondary education (SED) and baccalaureate (BA). A total of 1332 students (682 males, 650 females) took part in the study. All participants were aged between 10 and 20 years old (M = 13.09; SD = 2.47) and belonged to 13 different schools in Southwest Spain. They completed the cooperative learning questionnaire (CLQ), referring to the PE classes, in addition to the emotional intelligence questionnaire in physical education (EIQPE). Positive and significant associations were found between CL and EI in all school stages. In addition, moderately strong associations were uncovered between CL and the different dimensions of EI: emotional recognition, emotional control and regulation and emotional empathy. Participants belonging to classrooms with larger cooperation indices presented higher levels of EI. Results also highlighted a greater use of CL in PE classes during the PED stage in comparison to the SED and BA stages. These outcomes are discussed in light of the existing literature and methodological implications are derived for teaching PE. The use of CL in PE is recommended because of its positive contribution to the affective domain through IE. This will be especially important during the SED and BA stages, where lower rates of CL were observed."
32679606,GWOVina: A grey wolf optimization approach to rigid and flexible receptor docking,Kin Meng Wong,"Protein-ligand docking programs are indispensable tools for predicting the binding pose of a ligand to the receptor protein. In this paper, we introduce an efficient flexible docking method, GWOVina, which is a variant of the Vina implementation using the grey wolf optimizer (GWO) and random walk for the global search, and the Dunbrack rotamer library for side-chain sampling. The new method was validated for rigid and flexible-receptor docking using four independent datasets. In rigid docking, GWOVina showed comparable docking performance to Vina in terms of ligand pose RMSD, success rate, and affinity prediction. In flexible-receptor docking, GWOVina has improved success rate compared to Vina and AutoDockFR. It ran 2 to 7 times faster than Vina and 40 to 100 times faster than AutoDockFR. Therefore, GWOVina can play a role in solving the complex flexible-receptor docking cases and is suitable for virtual screening of compound libraries. GWOVina is freely available at https://cbbio.cis.um.edu.mo/software/gwovina for testing."
32679472,"Relationships between intelligence, executive function and academic achievement in children born very preterm",Darren W T Dai,"Background: Children born very preterm are at higher risk of adverse neurocognitive and educational outcomes. However, how low intelligence (IQ) and low executive function may each contribute to poorer academic outcomes at school age requires clarification. Aim: To examine the associations between intelligence, executive function and academic achievement in children born very preterm. Design/methods: This cohort study assessed children born <30 weeks' gestation or <1500 g at age 7 years using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fourth Edition (WISC-IV) for IQ, and the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch) and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) for executive function. Academic achievement was rated by teachers against curriculum standards. Results: Of the 76 children (35 girls, 41 boys, mean age = 7.2 year), 22 (28%) were rated below expected level for reading, 32 (42%) for writing and 38 (50%) for mathematics. After adjustment for sex and socioeconomic status, low IQ (OR's 9.0-12.3) and most low executive function measures (OR's 4.1-9.3) were associated with below-expected achievement. After further adjustment for IQ, low cognitive flexibility (OR = 9.3, 95% CI = 1.2-71.5) and teacher ratings of executive function (OR = 5.3, 95% CI = 1.4-20.2) were associated with below-expected achievement. Mediation analysis showed IQ had indirect effects on writing (b = 1.5, 95% CI = 0.6-3.1) via attentional control; and on reading (b = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.2-3.2) and writing (b = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.1-2.5) via cognitive flexibility. Conclusions: Both low IQ and low executive function are associated with below-expected teacher-rated academic achievement in children born very preterm. IQ may influence academic achievement in part through executive function."
32679299,Sex is associated with differences in gut microbial composition and function in hepatic encephalopathy,Krishnakant Saboo,"Background & aims: Altered microbiota can affect the gut-liver-brain axis in cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (HE), but the impact of sex on these changes is unclear. We aimed to determine differences in fecal microbiota composition/functionality between men and women with cirrhosis and HE on differing treatments. Methods: Cross-sectional stool microbiome composition (16s rRNA sequencing) and microbial functional analyses were performed in men and women with cirrhosis, and controls. Patients with HE on rifaximin+lactulose (HE-Rif), patients with HE on lactulose only (HE-Lac) and those with cirrhosis without HE (No-HE) were compared to controls using random forest classifier. Men and women were also compared. Results: A total of 761 individuals were included, 619 with cirrhosis (466 men, 153 women) and 142 controls (92 men, 50 women). Men were older and more frequently used proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), but model for end-stage liver disease score, No-HE (n = 319), HE-lac (n = 130) and HE-Rif (n = 170) proportions were similar. PPI/age-adjusted AUC of differentiation between controls vs. all cirrhosis, and controls vs. No-HE were higher within women than men, but the adjusted AUC for No-HE vs. HE-Rif was higher in men. Control vs. HE-Rif differentiation was similar across sexes. Men vs. women were different in all cirrhosis, No-HE and HE-Lac but not HE-Rif on PERMANOVA and AUC analyses. Autochthonous taxa decreased and pathobionts increased with disease progression regardless of sex. In men, Lactobacillaceae were higher in HE-Lac but decreased in HE-Rif, along with Veillonellaceae. Pathways related to glutamate and aromatic compound degradation were higher in men at all stages. Degradation of androstenedione, an estrogenic precursor, was lower in men vs. women in HE-Rif, likely enhancing feminization. Conclusions: There are differences in gut microbial function and composition between men and women with cirrhosis, which could be implicated in differential responses to HE therapies. Further studies linking these differences to sex-specific outcomes are needed. Lay summary: Patients with cirrhosis develop changes in their brain function, and men often develop feminization with disease progression. However, the interaction between sex, microbiota and disease severity is unclear. We found that as disease progressed in men, their microbial composition began to approach that observed in women, with changes in specific microbes that are associated with male hormone metabolism."
32678746,Prenatal and postnatal lead exposures and intellectual development among 12-year-old Japanese children,Nozomi Tatsuta,"Background: Low-level lead exposure during childhood is associated with deficit in child IQ. However, the association between prenatal lead exposure and child IQ remains inconsistent. The objective of our study was to examine the association between prenatal/postnatal lead exposure and child IQ at the age of 12. Methods: We obtained data pertaining to cord-blood and child-blood lead levels and IQ for 286 children from a prospective birth cohort study (Tohoku Study of Child Development). IQ was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition. Simultaneously, the Boston Naming Test (BNT) was used to assess the children's language ability. Results: The median lead level in the cord blood was 0.8 μg/dL (5th-95th percentiles, 0.4-1.4 μg/dL), and that in the blood of 12-year-old children was 0.7 μg/dL (0.4-1.1 μg/dL). IQ and BNT scores were significantly lower in boys than in girls; therefore, multiple regression analysis was conducted separately for boys and girls. Among boys, IQ was associated with child-blood lead (B = -16.362, p = 0.033) but not cord-blood lead (B = -6.844, p = 0.309). When boys were divided into four groups according to the child-blood lead levels, there was a significant decreasing trend for IQ. The score with cues of the BNT was associated with both cord-blood (B = -5.893, p = 0.025) and child-blood (B = -7.108, p = 0.022) lead concentrations in boys. Among girls, there was no significant association of the outcomes with cord-blood or child-blood lead level. Conclusions: These findings suggest that postnatal lead exposure adversely affects the intellectual ability in boys. Furthermore, the language ability is sensitive to prenatal/postnatal lead exposure in boys."
32678261,"A fully automated artificial intelligence method for non-invasive, imaging-based identification of genetic alterations in glioblastomas",Evan Calabrese,"Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain parenchymal tumor yet remains challenging to treat. The current standard of care-resection and chemoradiation-is limited in part due to the genetic heterogeneity of glioblastoma. Previous studies have identified several tumor genetic biomarkers that are frequently present in glioblastoma and can alter clinical management. Currently, genetic biomarker status is confirmed with tissue sampling, which is costly and only available after tumor resection or biopsy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a fully automated artificial intelligence approach for predicting the status of several common glioblastoma genetic biomarkers on preoperative MRI. We retrospectively analyzed multisequence preoperative brain MRI from 199 adult patients with glioblastoma who subsequently underwent tumor resection and genetic testing. Radiomics features extracted from fully automated deep learning-based tumor segmentations were used to predict nine common glioblastoma genetic biomarkers with random forest regression. The proposed fully automated method was useful for predicting IDH mutations (sensitivity = 0.93, specificity = 0.88), ATRX mutations (sensitivity = 0.94, specificity = 0.92), chromosome 7/10 aneuploidies (sensitivity = 0.90, specificity = 0.88), and CDKN2 family mutations (sensitivity = 0.76, specificity = 0.86)."
32677567,Automated Measurement of Lumbar Lordosis on Radiographs Using Machine Learning and Computer Vision,Brian H Cho,"Study design: Cross sectional database study. Objective: To develop a fully automated artificial intelligence and computer vision pipeline for assisted evaluation of lumbar lordosis. Methods: Lateral lumbar radiographs were used to develop a segmentation neural network (n = 629). After synthetic augmentation, 70% of these radiographs were used for network training, while the remaining 30% were used for hyperparameter optimization. A computer vision algorithm was deployed on the segmented radiographs to calculate lumbar lordosis angles. A test set of radiographs was used to evaluate the validity of the entire pipeline (n = 151). Results: The U-Net segmentation achieved a test dataset dice score of 0.821, an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.914, and an accuracy of 0.862. The computer vision algorithm identified the L1 and S1 vertebrae on 84.1% of the test set with an average speed of 0.14 seconds/radiograph. From the 151 test set radiographs, 50 were randomly chosen for surgeon measurement. When compared with those measurements, our algorithm achieved a mean absolute error of 8.055° and a median absolute error of 6.965° (not statistically significant, P > .05). Conclusion: This study is the first to use artificial intelligence and computer vision in a combined pipeline to rapidly measure a sagittal spinopelvic parameter without prior manual surgeon input. The pipeline measures angles with no statistically significant differences from manual measurements by surgeons. This pipeline offers clinical utility in an assistive capacity, and future work should focus on improving segmentation network performance."
32677419,Small bowel capsule endoscopy: where do we stand after 20 years of clinical use?,Marco Pennazio,"Small bowel capsule endoscopy (SBCE) was introduced into clinical practice almost 20 years ago and, nowadays, it is an essential tool for the study of the small bowel. SBCE allows a radiation-free examination of the entire mucosal surface of the small bowel with high-quality images, limited invasivity and a good safety profile. Nevertheless, the main limitation of SBCE is the lack of any possible direct therapeutic intervention. Indications for SBCE have evolved throughout the years, from ""old"" ones such as suspected small bowel bleeding (still the main indication for SBCE) to newer ones such as refractory celiac disease, hereditary polyposis syndromes and Crohn's disease. Thus, nowadays SBCE has a key role in the diagnostic algorithms in many conditions. Furthermore, the introduction in the SBCE field of cutting-edge technologies, as artificial intelligence systems, is likely to shorten the reading time making SBCE even more effective and easy to perform. Preliminary data are extremely promising and solid evidence is being gathered by current studies."
32677383,Deep Learning Algorithm for Automated Segmentation and Volume Measurement of the Liver and Spleen Using Portal Venous Phase Computed Tomography Images,Yura Ahn,"Objective: Measurement of the liver and spleen volumes has clinical implications. Although computed tomography (CT) volumetry is considered to be the most reliable noninvasive method for liver and spleen volume measurement, it has limited application in clinical practice due to its time-consuming segmentation process. We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning algorithm (DLA) for fully automated liver and spleen segmentation using portal venous phase CT images in various liver conditions. Materials and methods: A DLA for liver and spleen segmentation was trained using a development dataset of portal venous CT images from 813 patients. Performance of the DLA was evaluated in two separate test datasets: dataset-1 which included 150 CT examinations in patients with various liver conditions (i.e., healthy liver, fatty liver, chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and post-hepatectomy) and dataset-2 which included 50 pairs of CT examinations performed at ours and other institutions. The performance of the DLA was evaluated using the dice similarity score (DSS) for segmentation and Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement (LOA) for measurement of the volumetric indices, which was compared with that of ground truth manual segmentation. Results: In test dataset-1, the DLA achieved a mean DSS of 0.973 and 0.974 for liver and spleen segmentation, respectively, with no significant difference in DSS across different liver conditions (p = 0.60 and 0.26 for the liver and spleen, respectively). For the measurement of volumetric indices, the Bland-Altman 95% LOA was -0.17 ± 3.07% for liver volume and -0.56 ± 3.78% for spleen volume. In test dataset-2, DLA performance using CT images obtained at outside institutions and our institution was comparable for liver (DSS, 0.982 vs. 0.983; p = 0.28) and spleen (DSS, 0.969 vs. 0.968; p = 0.41) segmentation. Conclusion: The DLA enabled highly accurate segmentation and volume measurement of the liver and spleen using portal venous phase CT images of patients with various liver conditions."

32676992,Development of an artificial intelligence diagnostic model based on dynamic uncertain causality graph for the differential diagnosis of dyspnea,Yang Jiao,"Dyspnea is one of the most common manifestations of patients with pulmonary disease, myocardial dysfunction, and neuromuscular disorder, among other conditions. Identifying the causes of dyspnea in clinical practice, especially for the general practitioner, remains a challenge. This pilot study aimed to develop a computer-aided tool for improving the efficiency of differential diagnosis. The disease set with dyspnea as the chief complaint was established on the basis of clinical experience and epidemiological data. Differential diagnosis approaches were established and optimized by clinical experts. The artificial intelligence (AI) diagnosis model was constructed according to the dynamic uncertain causality graph knowledge-based editor. Twenty-eight diseases and syndromes were included in the disease set. The model contained 132 variables of symptoms, signs, and serological and imaging parameters. Medical records from the electronic hospital records of Suining Central Hospital were randomly selected. A total of 202 discharged patients with dyspnea as the chief complaint were included for verification, in which the diagnoses of 195 cases were coincident with the record certified as correct. The overall diagnostic accuracy rate of the model was 96.5%. In conclusion, the diagnostic accuracy of the AI model is promising and may compensate for the limitation of medical experience."

32676784,Comparison of machine learning algorithms to predict clinically significant prostate cancer of the peripheral zone with multiparametric MRI using clinical assessment categories and radiomic features,Simon Bernatz,"Objectives: To analyze the performance of radiological assessment categories and quantitative computational analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps using variant machine learning algorithms to differentiate clinically significant versus insignificant prostate cancer (PCa). Methods: Retrospectively, 73 patients were included in the study. The patients (mean age, 66.3 ± 7.6 years) were examined with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) prior to radical prostatectomy (n = 33) or targeted biopsy (n = 40). The index lesion was annotated in MRI ADC and the equivalent histologic slides according to the highest Gleason Grade Group (GrG). Volumes of interest (VOIs) were determined for each lesion and normal-appearing peripheral zone. VOIs were processed by radiomic analysis. For the classification of lesions according to their clinical significance (GrG ≥ 3), principal component (PC) analysis, univariate analysis (UA) with consecutive support vector machines, neural networks, and random forest analysis were performed. Results: PC analysis discriminated between benign and malignant prostate tissue. PC evaluation yielded no stratification of PCa lesions according to their clinical significance, but UA revealed differences in clinical assessment categories and radiomic features. We trained three classification models with fifteen feature subsets. We identified a subset of shape features which improved the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical assessment categories (maximum increase in diagnostic accuracy ΔAUC = + 0.05, p < 0.001) while also identifying combinations of features and models which reduced overall accuracy. Conclusions: The impact of radiomic features to differentiate PCa lesions according to their clinical significance remains controversial. It depends on feature selection and the employed machine learning algorithms. It can result in improvement or reduction of diagnostic performance. Key points: • Quantitative imaging features differ between normal and malignant tissue of the peripheral zone in prostate cancer. • Radiomic feature analysis of clinical routine multiparametric MRI has the potential to improve the stratification of clinically significant versus insignificant prostate cancer lesions in the peripheral zone. • Certain combinations of standard multiparametric MRI reporting and assessment categories with feature subsets and machine learning algorithms reduced the diagnostic performance over standard clinical assessment categories alone."
32676487,Risk for Behavioral Problems Independent of Cognitive Functioning in Children Born at Low Gestational Ages,Erik Domellöf,"This study aimed to investigate cognitive and behavioral outcomes in relation to gestational age (GA) in school-aged children born preterm (PT). Results from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition (WISC-IV), and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were analyzed in 51 children (mean age: 7.8 years [range: 7.0-8.7]) born PT (mean GA: 31 weeks [range: 23-35]; birth weight, mean: 1,637 g [range: 404-2,962]) with the majority (96%) having no diagnosed cognitive, sensory, or motor impairments. The control group included 57 age-matched typically developing children (mean age: 7.9 years [range: 6.2-8.7]) born full-term (FT). Children born PT, extremely PT (GA < 28) in particular, showed significantly lower cognitive performance and higher behavioral problem scores compared with children born FT. GA was found to predict aspects of both cognitive functioning and behavioral problems within the PT group, with lower GA being related to both poorer cognitive outcomes and elevated affective and attention-deficit/hyperactivity problems. Global cognitive functioning did not independently predict aspects of behavioral outcomes. Findings demonstrate that, even in children born PT without severe perinatal and/or postnatal complications and receiving active perinatal care, a short gestation is an evident risk factor for long-term negative effects on mental health independent of cognitive functioning. Additional findings suggest that both reduced growth and lower parental educational level may contribute to increased risk for poorer cognitive and behavioral functioning in children born PT."
32676314,Artificial intelligence and lung cancer treatment decision: agreement with recommendation of multidisciplinary tumor board,Min-Seok Kim,"Background: IBM Watson for Oncology (WFO) is a cognitive computing system helping physicians quickly identify key information in a patient's medical record, surface relevant evidence, and explore treatment options. This study assessed the possibility of using WFO for clinical treatment in lung cancer patients. Methods: We evaluated the level of agreement between WFO and multidisciplinary team (MDT) for lung cancer. From January to December 2018, newly diagnosed lung cancer cases in Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital were retrospectively examined using WFO version 18.4 according to four treatment categories (surgery, radiotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, and palliative care). Treatment recommendations were considered concordant if the MDT recommendations were designated 'recommended' by WFO. Concordance between MDT and WFO was analyzed by Cohen's kappa value. Results: In total, 405 (male 340, female 65) cases with different histology (adenocarcinoma 157, squamous cell carcinoma 132, small cell carcinoma 94, others 22 cases) were enrolled. Concordance between MDT and WFO occurred in 92.4% (k=0.881, P<0.001) of all cases, and concordance differed according to clinical stages. The strength of agreement was very good in stage IV non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) (100%, k=1.000) and extensive disease small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) (100%, k=1.000). In stage I NSCLC, the agreement strength was good (92.4%, k=0.855). The concordance was moderate in stage III NSCLC (80.8%, k=0.622) and relatively low in stage II NSCLC (83.3%, k=0.556) and limited disease SCLC (84.6%, k=0.435). There were discordant cases in surgery (7/57, 12.3%), radiotherapy (2/12, 16.7%), and chemoradiotherapy (15/129, 11.6%), but no discordance in metastatic disease patients. Conclusions: Treatment recommendations made by WFO and MDT were highly concordant for lung cancer cases especially in metastatic stage. However, WFO was just an assisting tool in stage I-III NSCLC and limited disease SCLC; so, patient-doctor relationship and shared decision making may be more important in this stage."
32676206,Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cardiovascular Diseases: An Unexpected Alliance,Silvia Romiti,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD), despite the significant advances in the diagnosis and treatments, still represents the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In order to improve and optimize CVD outcomes, artificial intelligence techniques have the potential to radically change the way we practice cardiology, especially in imaging, offering us novel tools to interpret data and make clinical decisions. AI techniques such as machine learning and deep learning can also improve medical knowledge due to the increase of the volume and complexity of the data, unlocking clinically relevant information. Likewise, the use of emerging communication and information technologies is becoming pivotal to create a pervasive healthcare service through which elderly and chronic disease patients can receive medical care at their home, reducing hospitalizations and improving quality of life. The aim of this review is to describe the contemporary state of artificial intelligence and digital health applied to cardiovascular medicine as well as to provide physicians with their potential not only in cardiac imaging but most of all in clinical practice."
32675784,"Prediagnostic Image Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Pancreatic Cancer: A Tell-Tale Sign to Early Detection",Matthew R Young,"Pancreatic cancer continues to be one of the deadliest malignancies and is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Based on several models, it is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030. Although the overall survival rate for patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer is less than 10%, survival rates are increasing in those whose cancers are detected at an early stage, when intervention is possible. There are, however, no reliable biomarkers or imaging technology that can detect early-stage pancreatic cancer or accurately identify precursors that are likely to progress to malignancy. The Alliance of Pancreatic Cancer Consortia, a virtual consortium of researchers, clinicians, and advocacies focused on early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, was formed in 2016 to provide a platform and resources to discover and validate biomarkers and imaging methods for early detection. The focus of discussion at the most recent alliance meeting was on imaging methods and the use of artificial intelligence for early detection of pancreatic cancer."

They were then received titrated steroids treatment based on the assessment of computed tomography (CT) images augmented and analyzed with the artificial intelligence (AI) tool and output. Three patients were finally recovered and discharged. The result indicated that sufficient steroids may be effective in treating the COVID-19 patients after frequent evaluation and timely adjustment according to the disease severity assessed based on the quantitative analysis of the images of serial CT scans."
35005123,Mettl5 mediated 18S rRNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification controls stem cell fate determination and neural function,Lu Wang,"Ribosome RNA (rRNA) accounts for more than 80% of the cell's total RNA, while the physiological functions of rRNA modifications are poorly understood. Mutations of 18S rRNA m6A methyltransferase METTL5 cause intellectual disability, microcephaly, and facial dysmorphisms in patients, however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we identified METTL5 protein complex and revealed that METTL5 mainly interacts with RNA binding proteins and ribosome proteins. Functionally, we found that Mettl5 knockout in mESCs leads to the abnormal craniofacial and nervous development. Moreover, using Mettl5 knockout mouse model, we further demonstrated that Mettl5 knockout mice exhibit intellectual disability, recapitulating the human phenotype. Mechanistically, we found that Mettl5 maintains brain function and intelligence by regulating the myelination process. Our study uncovered the causal correlation between mis-regulated 18S rRNA m6A modification and neural function defects, supporting the important physiological functions of rRNA modifications in human diseases."
32674047,Using the VQ-VAE to improve the recognition of abnormalities in short-duration 12-lead electrocardiogram records,Han Liu,"Background and objective: Morphological diagnosis is a basic clinical task of the short-duration 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Due to the scarcity of positive samples and other factors, there is currently no algorithm that is comparable to human experts in ECG morphological recognition. Our objective is to develop an ECG specialist-level deep learning method that can accurately identify ten ECG morphological abnormalities in real scene data. Methods: We established a short-duration 12-lead ECG image dataset that consists of approximately 200,000 samples. To address the problems with small positive samples, a data augmentation method was proposed. We solved it by interpolating in the latent space of the vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) and generating new samples via sampling. The trained final classifier, general doctors, and ECG specialists evaluated the diagnostic performance on a test set that consisted of 1000 samples. Results: Relative to that of unaugmented data, the F1 score was improved by 0-6%. Compared with ECG specialists, the deep neural network achieved higher F1 scores and sensitivity in most categories. Conclusions: Our method can improve the classification performance of ECG data with insufficient positive samples and reach the level of ECG specialists. This approach can provide specialized reference opinions for ordinary clinicians and reduce the errors of ECG specialists."
32674040,Use of artificial intelligence in diagnosis of head and neck precancerous and cancerous lesions: A systematic review,H Mahmood,"This systematic review analyses and describes the application and diagnostic accuracy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods used for detection and grading of potentially malignant (pre-cancerous) and cancerous head and neck lesions using whole slide images (WSI) of human tissue slides. Electronic databases MEDLINE via OVID, Scopus and Web of Science were searched between October 2009 - April 2020. Tailored search-strings were developed using database-specific terms. Studies were selected using a strict inclusion criterion following PRISMA Guidelines. Risk of bias assessment was conducted using a tailored QUADAS-2 tool. Out of 315 records, 11 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. AI-based methods were employed for analysis of specific histological features for oral epithelial dysplasia (n = 1), oral submucous fibrosis (n = 5), oral squamous cell carcinoma (n = 4) and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1). A combination of heuristics, supervised and unsupervised learning methods were employed, including more than 10 different classification and segmentation techniques. Most studies used uni-centric datasets (range 40-270 images) comprising small sub-images within WSI with accuracy between 79 and 100%. This review provides early evidence to support the potential application of supervised machine learning methods as a diagnostic aid for some oral potentially malignant and malignant lesions; however, there is a paucity of evidence using AI for diagnosis of other head and neck pathologies. Overall, the quality of evidence is low, with most studies showing a high risk of bias which is likely to have overestimated accuracy rates. This review highlights the need for development of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in future head and neck research."
32673625,Advanced Characterization of Silicone Oil Droplets in Protein Therapeutics Using Artificial Intelligence Analysis of Imaging Flow Cytometry Data,Christine Probst,"Monitoring protein particles is increasingly emphasized in the development of biopharmaceuticals due to potential immunogenicity. Accurate quantitation of protein particles is complicated by silicone oil droplets, a common pharmaceutical component in pre-filled syringes. Though silicone oil is typically regarded as harmless, numerous reports have indicated protein adsorption may render these particles with immunostimulatory properties. Imaging flow cytometry (IFC) is an emerging pharmaceutical method capable of capturing high-resolution brightfield and fluorescence imagery from samples in suspension. In this study, we created a data analysis strategy using artificial intelligence (AI) software to classify brightfield images collected with IFC as protein or silicone oil. The AI software performs image classification using deep learning with a convolutional neural network architecture, for identification of subtle morphological phenotypes. The AI model yielded robust classification of particles >2 μm across various sources of protein and silicone oil particles and over the instrument life cycle. Next, the AI model was combined with IFC fluorescence images to differentiate potentially immunogenic protein-adsorbed silicone and innocuous native silicone. The methods reported herein provide added analytical capability for characterization of particulate matter in therapeutic formulations, and may be applied for optimization of protein formulations and evaluation of product consistency."
32673383,Application of artificial intelligence to the in silico assessment of antimicrobial resistance and risks to human and animal health presented by priority enteric bacterial pathogens,Rylan Steinkey,"Each year, approximately one in eight Canadians are affected by foodborne illness, either through outbreaks or sporadic illness, with animals being the major reservoir for the pathogens. Whole genome sequence analyses are now routinely implemented by public and animal health laboratories to define epidemiological disease clusters and to identify potential sources of infection. Similarly, a number of bioinformatics tools can be used to identify virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants in the genomes of pathogenic strains. Many important clinical and phenotypic characteristics of these pathogens can now be predicted using machine learning algorithms applied to whole genome sequence data. In this overview, we compare the ability of support vector machines, gradient-boosted decision trees and artificial neural networks to predict the levels of AMR within Salmonella enterica and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli. We show that minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for each of 13 antimicrobials for S. enterica strains can be accurately determined, and that ESBL-producing E. coli strains can be accurately classified as susceptible, intermediate or resistant for each of seven antimicrobials. In addition to AMR and bacterial populations of greatest risk to human health, artificial intelligence algorithms hold promise as tools to predict other clinically and epidemiologically important phenotypes of enteric pathogens."
32673381,A call for an ethical framework when using social media data for artificial intelligence applications in public health research,Jean-Philippe Gilbert,"Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), more precisely the subfield of machine learning, and their applications to open-source internet data, such as social media, are growing faster than the management of ethical issues for use in society. An ethical framework helps scientists and policy makers consider ethics in their fields of practice, legitimize their work and protect members of the data-generating public. A central question for advancing the ethical framework is whether or not Tweets, Facebook posts and other open-source social media data generated by the public represent a human or not. The objective of this paper is to highlight ethical issues that the public health sector will be or is already confronting when using social media data in practice. The issues include informed consent, privacy, anonymization and balancing these issues with the benefits of using social media data for the common good. Current ethical frameworks need to provide guidance for addressing issues arising from the use of social media data in the public health sector. Discussions in this area should occur while the application of open-source data is still relatively new, and they should also keep pace as other problems arise from ongoing technological change."
32673380,Challenges and opportunities for public health made possible by advances in natural language processing,Oliver Baclic,"Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence devoted to understanding and generation of language. The recent advances in NLP technologies are enabling rapid analysis of vast amounts of text, thereby creating opportunities for health research and evidence-informed decision making. The analysis and data extraction from scientific literature, technical reports, health records, social media, surveys, registries and other documents can support core public health functions including the enhancement of existing surveillance systems (e.g. through faster identification of diseases and risk factors/at-risk populations), disease prevention strategies (e.g. through more efficient evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of interventions) and health promotion efforts (e.g. by providing the ability to obtain expert-level answers to any health related question). NLP is emerging as an important tool that can assist public health authorities in decreasing the burden of health inequality/inequity in the population. The purpose of this paper is to provide some notable examples of both the potential applications and challenges of NLP use in public health."
32673247,Diagnosing Parkinson Disease Through Facial Expression Recognition: Video Analysis,Bo Jin,"Background: The number of patients with neurological diseases is currently increasing annually, which presents tremendous challenges for both patients and doctors. With the advent of advanced information technology, digital medical care is gradually changing the medical ecology. Numerous people are exploring new ways to receive a consultation, track their diseases, and receive rehabilitation training in more convenient and efficient ways. In this paper, we explore the use of facial expression recognition via artificial intelligence to diagnose a typical neurological system disease, Parkinson disease (PD). Objective: This study proposes methods to diagnose PD through facial expression recognition. Methods: We collected videos of facial expressions of people with PD and matched controls. We used relative coordinates and positional jitter to extract facial expression features (facial expression amplitude and shaking of small facial muscle groups) from the key points returned by Face++. Algorithms from traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning were utilized to diagnose PD. Results: The experimental results showed our models can achieve outstanding facial expression recognition ability for PD diagnosis. Applying a long short-term model neural network to the positions of the key features, precision and F1 values of 86% and 75%, respectively, can be reached. Further, utilizing a support vector machine algorithm for the facial expression amplitude features and shaking of the small facial muscle groups, an F1 value of 99% can be achieved. Conclusions: This study contributes to the digital diagnosis of PD based on facial expression recognition. The disease diagnosis model was validated through our experiment. The results can help doctors understand the real-time dynamics of the disease and even conduct remote diagnosis."
32673246,A Physical Activity and Diet Program Delivered by Artificially Intelligent Virtual Health Coach: Proof-of-Concept Study,Carol Ann Maher,"Background: Poor diet and physical inactivity are leading modifiable causes of death and disease. Advances in artificial intelligence technology present tantalizing opportunities for creating virtual health coaches capable of providing personalized support at scale. Objective: This proof of concept study aimed to test the feasibility (recruitment and retention) and preliminary efficacy of physical activity and Mediterranean-style dietary intervention (MedLiPal) delivered via artificially intelligent virtual health coach. Methods: This 12-week single-arm pre-post study took place in Adelaide, Australia, from March to August 2019. Participants were inactive community-dwelling adults aged 45 to 75 years, recruited through news stories, social media posts, and flyers. The program included access to an artificially intelligent chatbot, Paola, who guided participants through a computer-based individualized introductory session, weekly check-ins, and goal setting, and was available 24/7 to answer questions. Participants used a Garmin Vivofit4 tracker to monitor daily steps, a website with educational materials and recipes, and a printed diet and activity log sheet. Primary outcomes included feasibility (based on recruitment and retention) and preliminary efficacy for changing physical activity and diet. Secondary outcomes were body composition (based on height, weight, and waist circumference) and blood pressure. Results: Over 4 weeks, 99 potential participants registered expressions of interest, with 81 of those screened meeting eligibility criteria. Participants completed a mean of 109.8 (95% CI 1.9-217.7) more minutes of physical activity at week 12 compared with baseline. Mediterranean diet scores increased from a mean of 3.8 out of 14 at baseline, to 9.6 at 12 weeks (mean improvement 5.7 points, 95% CI 4.2-7.3). After 12 weeks, participants lost an average 1.3 kg (95% CI -0.1 to -2.5 kg) and 2.1 cm from their waist circumference (95% CI -3.5 to -0.7 cm). There were no significant changes in blood pressure. Feasibility was excellent in terms of recruitment, retention (90% at 12 weeks), and safety (no adverse events). Conclusions: An artificially intelligent virtual assistant-led lifestyle-modification intervention was feasible and achieved measurable improvements in physical activity, diet, and body composition at 12 weeks. Future research examining artificially intelligent interventions at scale, and for other health purposes, is warranted."
32673243,"A One-Step, Streamlined Children's Vision Screening Solution Based on Smartphone Imaging for Resource-Limited Areas: Design and Preliminary Field Evaluation",Shuoxin Ma,"Background: Young children's vision screening, as part of a preventative health care service, produces great value for developing regions. Besides yielding a high return on investment from forestalling surgeries using a low-cost intervention at a young age, it improves school performance and thus boosts future labor force quality. Leveraging low-skilled health care workers with smartphones and automated diagnosis to offer such programs can be a scalable model in resource-limited areas. Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an effective, efficient, and comprehensive vision screening solution for school children in resource-limited areas. First, such an exam would need to cover the major risk factors of amblyopia and myopia, 2 major sources of vision impairment effectively preventable at a young age. Second, the solution must be integrated with digital patient record-keeping for long-term monitoring and popular statistical analysis. Last, it should utilize low-skilled technicians and only low-cost tools that are available in a typical school in developing regions, without compromising quality or efficiency. Methods: A workflow for the screening program was designed and a smartphone app was developed to implement it. In the standardized screening procedure, a young child went through the smartphone-based photoscreening in a dark room. The child held a smartphone in front of their forehead, displaying pre-entered personal information as a quick response code that duplexed as a reference of scale. In one 10-second procedure, the child's personal information and interpupillary distance, relative visual axis alignment, and refractive error ranges were measured and analyzed automatically using image processing and artificial intelligence algorithms. The child's risk for strabismus, myopia, and anisometropia was then derived and consultation given. Results: A preliminary evaluation of the solution was conducted alongside yearly physical exams in Luoyang, Henan, People's Republic of China. It covered 20 students with suspected strabismus and 80 randomly selected students, aged evenly between 8 and 10. Each examinee took about 1 minute, and a streamlined workflow allowed 3 exams to run in parallel. The 1-shot and 2-shot measurement success rates were 87% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of strabismus detection were 0.80 and 0.98, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of myopia detection were 0.83 and 1.00, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of anisometropia detection were 0.80 and 1.00, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed vision screening program is effective, efficient, and scalable. Compared with previously published studies on utilizing a smartphone for an automated Hirschberg test and photorefraction screening, this comprehensive solution is optimized for practicality and robustness, and is thus better ready-to-deploy. Our evaluation validated the achievement of the program's design specifications."
32673231,Public Perception of Artificial Intelligence in Medical Care: Content Analysis of Social Media,Shuqing Gao,"Background: High-quality medical resources are in high demand worldwide, and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical care may help alleviate the crisis related to this shortage. The development of the medical AI industry depends to a certain extent on whether industry experts have a comprehensive understanding of the public's views on medical AI. Currently, the opinions of the general public on this matter remain unclear. Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the public perception of AI in medical care through a content analysis of social media data, including specific topics that the public is concerned about; public attitudes toward AI in medical care and the reasons for them; and public opinion on whether AI can replace human doctors. Methods: Through an application programming interface, we collected a data set from the Sina Weibo platform comprising more than 16 million users throughout China by crawling all public posts from January to December 2017. Based on this data set, we identified 2315 posts related to AI in medical care and classified them through content analysis. Results: Among the 2315 identified posts, we found three types of AI topics discussed on the platform: (1) technology and application (n=987, 42.63%), (2) industry development (n=706, 30.50%), and (3) impact on society (n=622, 26.87%). Out of 956 posts where public attitudes were expressed, 59.4% (n=568), 34.4% (n=329), and 6.2% (n=59) of the posts expressed positive, neutral, and negative attitudes, respectively. The immaturity of AI technology (27/59, 46%) and a distrust of related companies (n=15, 25%) were the two main reasons for the negative attitudes. Across 200 posts that mentioned public attitudes toward replacing human doctors with AI, 47.5% (n=95) and 32.5% (n=65) of the posts expressed that AI would completely or partially replace human doctors, respectively. In comparison, 20.0% (n=40) of the posts expressed that AI would not replace human doctors. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that people are most concerned about AI technology and applications. Generally, the majority of people held positive attitudes and believed that AI doctors would completely or partially replace human ones. Compared with previous studies on medical doctors, the general public has a more positive attitude toward medical AI. Lack of trust in AI and the absence of the humanistic care factor are essential reasons why some people still have a negative attitude toward medical AI. We suggest that practitioners may need to pay more attention to promoting the credibility of technology companies and meeting patients' emotional needs instead of focusing merely on technical issues."
32673000,Influence of blast exposure on cognitive functioning in combat veterans,Sarah L Martindale,"Objective: We evaluated the contribution of blast-pressure severity to cognitive functioning beyond posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Method: Post-9/11 veterans (N = 254, 86.22% male) completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) and Trail Making Test (TMT). The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5), Mid-Atlantic MIRECC Assessment of TBI, and the Salisbury Blast Interview evaluated PTSD diagnosis/severity, deployment TBI history/severity, and blast-exposure history/severity, respectively. Results: Veterans with mild deployment TBI had overall significantly lower T scores on the WAIS-IV Verbal Comprehension Index (d = .13), Working Memory Index (d = .30), and Processing Speed Index (d = .25); the Trail Making Test A (TMT-A; d = .50); and the Trail Making Test B (TMT-B; d = .37). Mild deployment TBI was significantly associated with TMT-A (ΔR² = .05, p < .001) and TMT-B (ΔR² = .03, p = .001) performance. Blast-pressure severity moderated the association between mild deployment TBI and TMT-A (ΔR² = .02, p = .039, B = -2.01). Conclusion: Blast-pressure severity exacerbated the effects of mild TBI on a simple attention task, such that participants with TBI had gradual decrements in attention as blast severity increased. Veterans who incur a TBI and are exposed to blasts during deployment may experience persisting difficulties with cognitive functioning as a result of alterations in basic attention abilities.

32672961,Transfer Learning for Drug Discovery,Chenjing Cai,"The data sets available to train models for in silico drug discovery efforts are often small. Indeed, the sparse availability of labeled data is a major barrier to artificial-intelligence-assisted drug discovery. One solution to this problem is to develop algorithms that can cope with relatively heterogeneous and scarce data. Transfer learning is a type of machine learning that can leverage existing, generalizable knowledge from other related tasks to enable learning of a separate task with a small set of data. Deep transfer learning is the most commonly used type of transfer learning in the field of drug discovery. This Perspective provides an overview of transfer learning and related applications to drug discovery to date. Furthermore, it provides outlooks on the future development of transfer learning for drug discovery."
32672766,Design optimization of orbital angular momentum fibers using the gray wolf optimizer,Seyed Mohammad Mirjalili,"Optical data communication based on the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light is a recently proposed method to enhance the transmission capacity of optical fibers. This requires a new type of optical fiber, the main part of the optical communication system, to be designed. Typically, these fibers have a ring-shaped refractive index profile. We aim to find an optimized cross section refractive index profile for an OAM fiber in which the number of supported OAM modes (channels), mode purity, and the effective refractive index separation of OAM modes to other fibers modes are maximized. However, the complexity of the relationship between structural parameters and optical transmission properties of these fibers has resulted in the lack of a comprehensive analytical method to design them. In this paper, we investigate the process of designing OAM fibers and propose a framework to design such fibers by using artificial intelligence optimizers. It is worth mentioning here that this problem is intrinsically a multiobjective optimization problem, and the actual solution for such problems is not unique and leads to a set of optimum solutions. Therefore, at the end of the optimization process, a wide range of optimal designs will be obtained in which a trade-off is established in each of the solutions. We solve this problem with the multiobjective gray wolf optimizer (GWO) and compare the results with that of the single-objective GWO. The framework can easily find many optimal designs that support more than 20 OAM modes. The obtained results show that the proposed method is comprehensive and can optimize the structure of any OAM fibers. No human involvement, simplicity, and being straightforward are the main advantages of the proposed framework."
32672365,Dietary interventions for phenylketonuria,Elisabeth Jameson,"Background: Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease treated with dietary restriction of the amino acid phenylalanine. The diet is initiated in the neonatal period to prevent learning disability; however, it is restrictive and can be difficult to follow. Whether the diet can be relaxed or discontinued during adolescence or should be continued for life remains a controversial issue, which we aim to address in this review. This is an updated version of a previously published review. Objectives: To assess the effects of a low-phenylalanine diet commenced early in life for people with phenylketonuria. To assess the possible effects of relaxation or termination of the diet on intelligence, neuropsychological outcomes and mortality, growth, nutritional status, eating behaviour and quality of life. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search of the Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 30 April 2020. Selection criteria: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing a low-phenylalanine diet to relaxation or termination of dietary restrictions in people with phenylketonuria. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality, and subsequently extracted the data. Main results: We included four studies in this review (251 participants), and found few significant differences between treatment and comparison groups for the outcomes of interest. Blood phenylalanine levels were significantly lower in participants with phenylketonuria following a low-phenylalanine diet compared to those on a less restricted diet, mean difference (MD) at three months -698.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) -869.44 to -527.89). Intelligence quotient was significantly higher in participants who continued the diet than in those who stopped the diet, MD after 12 months 5.00 (95% CI 0.40 to 9.60). However, these results came from a single study. Authors' conclusions: The results of non-randomised studies have concluded that a low-phenylalanine diet is effective in reducing blood phenylalanine levels and improving intelligence quotient and neuropsychological outcomes. We were unable to find any randomised controlled studies that have assessed the effect of a low-phenylalanine diet versus no diet from diagnosis. In view of evidence from non-randomised studies, such a study would be unethical and it is recommended that low-phenylalanine diet should be commenced at the time of diagnosis. There is uncertainty about the precise level of phenylalanine restriction and when, if ever, the diet should be relaxed. This should be addressed by randomised controlled studies; however, no new studies are expected in this area so we do not plan to update this review."
32672216,One-dimensional sensor learns to sense three-dimensional space,Chen Zhu,"A sensor system with ultra-high sensitivity, high resolution, rapid response time, and a high signal-to-noise ratio can produce raw data that is exceedingly rich in information, including signals that have the appearances of ""noise"". The ""noise"" feature directly correlates to measurands in orthogonal dimensions, and are simply manifestations of the off-diagonal elements of 2nd-order tensors that describe the spatial anisotropy of matter in physical structures and spaces. The use of machine learning techniques to extract useful meanings from the rich information afforded by ultra-sensitive one-dimensional sensors may offer the potential for probing mundane events for novel embedded phenomena. Inspired by our very recent invention of ultra-sensitive optical-based inclinometers, this work aims to answer a transformative question for the first time: can a single-dimension point sensor with ultra-high sensitivity, fidelity, and signal-to-noise ratio identify an arbitrary mechanical impact event in three-dimensional space? This work is expected to inspire researchers in the fields of sensing and measurement to promote the development of a new generation of powerful sensors or sensor networks with expanded functionalities and enhanced intelligence, which may provide rich n-dimensional information, and subsequently, data-driven insights into significant problems."
32672144,Hidden talents in harsh environments,Bruce J Ellis,"Although early-life adversity can undermine healthy development, children growing up in harsh environments may develop intact, or even enhanced, skills for solving problems in high-adversity contexts (i.e., ""hidden talents""). Here we situate the hidden talents model within a larger interdisciplinary framework. Summarizing theory and research on hidden talents, we propose that stress-adapted skills represent a form of adaptive intelligence that enables individuals to function within the constraints of harsh, unpredictable environments. We discuss the alignment of the hidden talents model with current knowledge about human brain development following early adversity; examine potential applications of this perspective to multiple sectors concerned with youth from harsh environments, including education, social services, and juvenile justice; and compare the hidden talents model with contemporary developmental resilience models. We conclude that the hidden talents approach offers exciting new directions for research on developmental adaptations to childhood adversity, with translational implications for leveraging stress-adapted skills to more effectively tailor education, jobs, and interventions to fit the needs and potentials of individuals from a diverse range of life circumstances. This approach affords a well-rounded view of people who live with adversity that avoids stigma and communicates a novel, distinctive, and strength-based message."
32671078,Artificial Intelligence in Skin Cancer Diagnostics: The Patients' Perspective,Tanja B Jutzi,"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in numerous experimental studies, particularly in skin cancer diagnostics. Translation of these findings into the clinic is the logical next step. This translation can only be successful if patients' concerns and questions are addressed suitably. We therefore conducted a survey to evaluate the patients' view of artificial intelligence in melanoma diagnostics in Germany, with a particular focus on patients with a history of melanoma. Participants and Methods: A web-based questionnaire was designed using LimeSurvey, sent by e-mail to university hospitals and melanoma support groups and advertised on social media. The anonymous questionnaire evaluated patients' expectations and concerns toward artificial intelligence in general as well as their attitudes toward different application scenarios. Descriptive analysis was performed with expression of categorical variables as percentages and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical tests were performed to investigate associations between sociodemographic data and selected items of the questionnaire. Results: 298 individuals (154 with a melanoma diagnosis, 143 without) responded to the questionnaire. About 94% [95% CI = 0.91-0.97] of respondents supported the use of artificial intelligence in medical approaches. 88% [95% CI = 0.85-0.92] would even make their own health data anonymously available for the further development of AI-based applications in medicine. Only 41% [95% CI = 0.35-0.46] of respondents were amenable to the use of artificial intelligence as stand-alone system, 94% [95% CI = 0.92-0.97] to its use as assistance system for physicians. In sub-group analyses, only minor differences were detectable. Respondents with a previous history of melanoma were more amenable to the use of AI applications for early detection even at home. They would prefer an application scenario where physician and AI classify the lesions independently. With respect to AI-based applications in medicine, patients were concerned about insufficient data protection, impersonality and susceptibility to errors, but expected faster, more precise and unbiased diagnostics, less diagnostic errors and support for physicians. Conclusions: The vast majority of participants exhibited a positive attitude toward the use of artificial intelligence in melanoma diagnostics, especially as an assistance system."
32671076,From Patient-Controlled Analgesia to Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Patient-Controlled Analgesia: Practices and Perspectives,Rui Wang,"Pain relief is a major concern for patients who have undergone surgery, and it is an eternal pursuit for anesthesiologists. However, postoperative pain management is far from satisfactory, though the past decades have witnessed great progress in the development of novel analgesics and analgesic techniques. A Cochrane systematic review showed that patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) achieved better pain relief and greater patient satisfaction than traditional ""on-demand"" parenteral analgesia, suggesting that it might be the manner of analgesia implementation that matters for effective postoperative pain management. A wireless intelligent PCA (Wi-PCA) system that incorporated remote monitoring, an intelligent alarm, intelligent analysis and assessment of the PCA equipment, as well as automatically recording and reserving key information functions under a wireless environment was introduced in our department in 2018. The practice showed that the Wi-PCA system significantly reduced the incidence of moderate to severe postoperative pain and relevant adverse effects, shortened hospital stays, and improved patient satisfaction with postoperative pain relief. Nevertheless, for both traditional and Wi-PCA, analgesics are only administered when pain occurs, leaving behind a realm of possibilities for better postoperative pain management. With the rapid development of machinery and deep learning algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the mode of clinical decision making. Integrating the big data collected by state-of-the-art monitoring sensors, the Internet of Things and AI algorithms, an AI-assisted PCA (Ai-PCA) may be a promising future direction for postoperative pain management."
32670710,The Future of Concurrent Automated Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring on Screening Low-Dose Computed Tomography,Jeffrey Waltz,"Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been extensively validated for lung cancer screening in selected patient populations. Additionally, the use of gated cardiac CT to assess coronary artery calcium (CAC) burden has been validated to determine a patient's risk for major cardiovascular adverse events. This is typically performed by calculating an Agatston score based on density and overall burden of calcified plaque within the coronary arteries. Patients that qualify for LDCT for lung cancer screening commonly share major risk factors for coronary artery disease and would frequently benefit from an additional gated cardiac CT for the assessment of CAC. Given the widespread use of LDCT for lung cancer screening, we evaluated current literature regarding the use of non-gated chest CT, specifically LDCT, for the detection and grading of coronary artery calcifications. Additionally, given the evolving and increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the interpretation of radiologic studies, current literature for the use of AI in CAC assessment was reviewed. We reviewed primary scientific literature dating up to April 2020 using Pubmed and Google Scholar, with the search terms low dose CT, lung cancer screening, coronary artery calcium, EKG/cardiac gated CT, deep learning, machine learning, and AI. These publications were then independently evaluated by each member of our team. Overall, there was a consensus within these papers that LDCT for lung cancer screening plays a role in the evaluation of CAC. Most studies note the inherent problems with the evaluation of the density of coronary calcifications on LDCT to give an accurate numeric calcium or Agatston score. The current method of evaluating CAC on LDCT involves using a qualitative categorical system (none, mild, moderate, or severe). When performed by cardiac imaging experts, this method broadly correlates with traditional CAC score groups (0, 1 to 100, 101 to 400, and > 400). Furthermore, given the high sensitivity of a properly protocolled LDCT for coronary calcium, a negative study for CAC precludes the need for a dedicated gated CT assessment. However, qualitative methods are not as accurate or reproducible when performed by general radiologists. The implementation of AI in the LDCT screening process has the potential to give a quantifiable and reproducible numeric value to the calcium score, based on whole heart volume scoring of calcium. This more closely aligns with the Agatston score and serves as a better guide for treatment and risk assessment using current guidelines. We conclude that CAC should be assessed on all LDCT performed for lung cancer screening and that a qualitative categorical scoring system should be provided in the impression for each patient. Early studies involving AI for the assessment of CAC are promising, but more extensive studies are needed before a final recommendation for its use can be given. The implementation of an accurate, automated AI CAC assessment tool would improve radiologist compliance and ease of overall workflow. Ultimately, the potential end result would be improved turnaround time, better patient outcomes, and reduced healthcare costs by maximizing preventative care in this high-risk population."
32670474,Artificial Intelligence in Cardiovascular Imaging,Lisa J Lim,"The number of cardiovascular imaging studies is growing exponentially, and so is the need to improve clinical workflow efficiency and avoid missed diagnoses. With the availability and use of large datasets, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve patient care at every stage of the imaging chain. Current literature indicates that in the short-term, AI has the capacity to reduce human error and save time in the clinical workflow through automated segmentation of cardiac structures. In the future, AI may expand the informational value of diagnostic images based on images alone or a combination of images and clinical variables, thus facilitating disease detection, prognosis, and decision making. This review describes the role of AI, specifically machine learning, in multimodality imaging, including echocardiography, nuclear imaging, computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance, and highlights current uses of AI as well as potential challenges to its widespread implementation."
32670174,A Digital Patient Portal for Patients With Multiple Sclerosis,Isabel Voigt,"Background: Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that requires a complex, differential, and lifelong treatment strategy, which involves high monitoring efforts and the accumulation of numerous medical data. A fast and broad availability of care, as well as patient-relevant data and a stronger integration of patients and participating care providers into the complex treatment process is desirable. The aim of the ERDF-funded project ""Integrated Care Portal Multiple Sclerosis"" (IBMS) was to develop a pathway-based care model and a corresponding patient portal for MS patients and health care professionals (HCPs) as a digital tool to deliver the care model. Methods: The patient portal was created according to a patient-centered design approach which involves both the patients' and the professionals' view. Buurmann's five iterative phases were integrated into a design science research process. A problem analysis focusing on functions and user interfaces was conducted through surveys and workshops with MS patients and HCPs. Based on this, the patient portal was refined and a prototype of the portal was implemented using an agile software development strategy. Results: HCPs and patients already use digital hardware and are open to new technologies. Nevertheless, they desire improved (digital) communication and coordination between care providers. Both groups require a number of functions for the patient portal, which were implemented in the prototype. Usability tests with patients and HCPs are planned to consider whether the portal is deemed as usable, acceptable as well as functional to prepare for any needed ameliorations. Discussion: After testing the patient portal for usability, acceptability, and functionality, it will most likely be a useful and high-quality electronic health (eHealth) tool for patient management from day care to telerehabilitation. It implements clinical pathways in a manner which is comprehensible for patients. Future developments of the patient portal modules could include additional diseases, the integration of quality management and privacy management tools, and the use of artificial intelligence to personalize treatment strategies."
32670045,"A Path Toward Explainable AI and Autonomous Adaptive Intelligence: Deep Learning, Adaptive Resonance, and Models of Perception, Emotion, and Action",Stephen Grossberg,"Biological neural network models whereby brains make minds help to understand autonomous adaptive intelligence. This article summarizes why the dynamics and emergent properties of such models for perception, cognition, emotion, and action are explainable, and thus amenable to being confidently implemented in large-scale applications. Key to their explainability is how these models combine fast activations, or short-term memory (STM) traces, and learned weights, or long-term memory (LTM) traces. Visual and auditory perceptual models have explainable conscious STM representations of visual surfaces and auditory streams in surface-shroud resonances and stream-shroud resonances, respectively. Deep Learning is often used to classify data. However, Deep Learning can experience catastrophic forgetting: At any stage of learning, an unpredictable part of its memory can collapse. Even if it makes some accurate classifications, they are not explainable and thus cannot be used with confidence. Deep Learning shares these problems with the back propagation algorithm, whose computational problems due to non-local weight transport during mismatch learning were described in the 1980s. Deep Learning became popular after very fast computers and huge online databases became available that enabled new applications despite these problems. Adaptive Resonance Theory, or ART, algorithms overcome the computational problems of back propagation and Deep Learning. ART is a self-organizing production system that incrementally learns, using arbitrary combinations of unsupervised and supervised learning and only locally computable quantities, to rapidly classify large non-stationary databases without experiencing catastrophic forgetting. ART classifications and predictions are explainable using the attended critical feature patterns in STM on which they build. The LTM adaptive weights of the fuzzy ARTMAP algorithm induce fuzzy IF-THEN rules that explain what feature combinations predict successful outcomes. ART has been successfully used in multiple large-scale real world applications, including remote sensing, medical database prediction, and social media data clustering. Also explainable are the MOTIVATOR model of reinforcement learning and cognitive-emotional interactions, and the VITE, DIRECT, DIVA, and SOVEREIGN models for reaching, speech production, spatial navigation, and autonomous adaptive intelligence. These biological models exemplify complementary computing, and use local laws for match learning and mismatch learning that avoid the problems of Deep Learning."
32670043,Using Long Short-Term Memory for Building Outdoor Agricultural Machinery,Chien-Hung Wu,"Today, climate change has caused a decrease in agricultural output or overall yields that are not as expected; however, with the ongoing population explosion, many undeveloped countries have transformed into emerging countries and have transformed farmland to be used in other types of applications. The resulting decline in agricultural output further increases the severity of the food crisis. In this context, this study proposes an outdoor agricultural robot that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The key features of this innovation include: (1) the robot is portable, and it uses green power to reduce installation cost, (2) the system combines the current environment with weather forecasts through LSTM to predict the correct timing for watering, (3) detecting the environment and utilizing information from weather forecasts can help the system to ensure that growing conditions are suitable for the crops, and (4) the robot is mainly for outdoor applications because such farms lack sufficient electricity and water resources, which makes the robot critical for environmental control and resource allocation. The experimental results indicate that the robot developed in this study can detect the environment effectively to control electricity and water resources. Additionally, because the system is planned to increase agricultural output significantly, the study predicts the variables through multivariate LSTM, which controls the power supply from the solar power system."
32670012,Supervised Learning in All FeFET-Based Spiking Neural Network: Opportunities and Challenges,Sourav Dutta,"The two possible pathways toward artificial intelligence (AI)-(i) neuroscience-oriented neuromorphic computing [like spiking neural network (SNN)] and (ii) computer science driven machine learning (like deep learning) differ widely in their fundamental formalism and coding schemes (Pei et al., 2019). Deviating from traditional deep learning approach of relying on neuronal models with static nonlinearities, SNNs attempt to capture brain-like features like computation using spikes. This holds the promise of improving the energy efficiency of the computing platforms. In order to achieve a much higher areal and energy efficiency compared to today's hardware implementation of SNN, we need to go beyond the traditional route of relying on CMOS-based digital or mixed-signal neuronal circuits and segregation of computation and memory under the von Neumann architecture. Recently, ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) are being explored as a promising alternative for building neuromorphic hardware by utilizing their non-volatile nature and rich polarization switching dynamics. In this work, we propose an all FeFET-based SNN hardware that allows low-power spike-based information processing and co-localized memory and computing (a.k.a. in-memory computing). We experimentally demonstrate the essential neuronal and synaptic dynamics in a 28 nm high-K metal gate FeFET technology. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the traditional machine learning approach of optimizing a cost function to adjust the synaptic weights, we implement a surrogate gradient (SG) learning algorithm on our SNN platform that allows us to perform supervised learning on MNIST dataset. As such, we provide a pathway toward building energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware that can support traditional machine learning algorithms. Finally, we undertake synergistic device-algorithm co-design by accounting for the impacts of device-level variation (stochasticity) and limited bit precision of on-chip synaptic weights (available analog states) on the classification accuracy."
32670002,Exploring the Connection Between Binary and Spiking Neural Networks,Sen Lu,"On-chip edge intelligence has necessitated the exploration of algorithmic techniques to reduce the compute requirements of current machine learning frameworks. This work aims to bridge the recent algorithmic progress in training Binary Neural Networks and Spiking Neural Networks-both of which are driven by the same motivation and yet synergies between the two have not been fully explored. We show that training Spiking Neural Networks in the extreme quantization regime results in near full precision accuracies on large-scale datasets like CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. An important implication of this work is that Binary Spiking Neural Networks can be enabled by ""In-Memory"" hardware accelerators catered for Binary Neural Networks without suffering any accuracy degradation due to binarization. We utilize standard training techniques for non-spiking networks to generate our spiking networks by conversion process and also perform an extensive empirical analysis and explore simple design-time and run-time optimization techniques for reducing inference latency of spiking networks (both for binary and full-precision models) by an order of magnitude over prior work. Our implementation source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/NeuroCompLab-psu/SNN-Conversion."
32669685,Applications of machine learning to diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases,Monika A Myszczynska,"Globally, there is a huge unmet need for effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. The complexity of the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal degeneration and the heterogeneity of the patient population present massive challenges to the development of early diagnostic tools and effective treatments for these diseases. Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, is enabling scientists, clinicians and patients to address some of these challenges. In this Review, we discuss how machine learning can aid early diagnosis and interpretation of medical images as well as the discovery and development of new therapies. A unifying theme of the different applications of machine learning is the integration of multiple high-dimensional sources of data, which all provide a different view on disease, and the automated derivation of actionable insights."
32669115,Ontological model of multi-agent Smart-system for predicting drug properties based on modified algorithms of artificial immune systems,Galina Samigulina,"Background: Currently, due to the huge progress in the field of information technologies and computer equipment, it is important to use modern approaches of artificial intelligence in order to process extensive chemical information at creating new drugs with desired properties. The interdisciplinary of research creates additional difficulties in creating new drugs. Currently, there are no universal algorithms and software for predicting the ""structure-property"" dependence of drug compounds that can take into account the needs of specialists in this field. In this regard, the development of a modern Smart-system based on the promising bio-inspired approach of artificial immune systems for predicting the structure-property dependence of drug compounds is relevant. The aim of this work is to develop a multi-agent Smart-system for predicting the ""structure-property"" dependence of drug compounds using the ontological approach and modified algorithms of artificial immune systems using the example of drug compounds of the sulfonamide group. The proposed system makes it possible to increase the accuracy of prediction models of the ""structure-property"" dependence, to reduce the time and financial costs for obtaining candidate drug compounds. Methods: During the creation of a Smart-system, there are used multi-agent and ontological approaches, which allow to structure input and output data, optimally to distribute computing resources and to coordinate the work of the system. As a promising approach for processing a large amount of chemical information, extracting informative descriptors and for the creation of an optimal data set, as well as further predicting the properties of medicinal compounds, there are considered modified algorithms of artificial immune systems and various algorithms of artificial intelligence. Results: There was developed an ontological model of a multi-agent Smart-system. There are presented the results of the «structure-property» dependence simulation based on a modified grey wolf optimization algorithm and artificial immune systems. During the simulation, there was used information from the Mol-Instincts sulfonamide descriptor database. Conclusion: The developed multi-agent Smart-system using ontological models allows visually to present the structure and interrelationships of agents functioning, which greatly facilitates the development of software and reduces time and financial costs during the development of new drugs."
32669041,The relationship between neuropsychological function and responsiveness to vitamin D supplementation using artificial neural networks,Elahe Allahyari,"Background: Vitamin D has recently attracted interest for its pleiotropic effects. Vitamin D supplements are a potentially important public health intervention, but the response to supplementation varies between individuals. Aim: We aimed to assess the association between several neuropsychological parameters and the magnitude of response to vitamin D supplementation using an artificial neural network method. Methods: Neuropsychological function was assessed in 619 participants using standard questionnaires. The study participants received vitamin D capsules containing 50,000 IU vitamin D per week over 9 weeks. To assess the relationship between responsiveness to vitamin D supplements and the impact on these neuropsychological parameters, the best-performing artificial neural network algorithms were selected from a combination of different transfer functions in hidden and output layers and variable numbers of hidden layers (between two and 50). The performance of the artificial neural network algorithm was assessed by receiver operating characteristic analysis and variables of importance were identified. Results: The artificial neural network algorithm with sigmoid transfer function in both hidden and output layers could predict responsiveness to vitamin D supplementation effectively. The sensitivity and specificity were between 0.60 and 0.70 and 0.66 and 0.70, respectively. Cognitive abilities (42.5%), basal vitamin D (21.3%), body mass index (9.5%), and daytime sleepiness (8%) are the most widely used variables to predict changes in serum vitamin D levels. Conclusions: Cognitive abilities status and baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D are important novel modifiers of the enhancement in circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D after vitamin D supplementation."
32668721,Current Trends of Artificial Intelligence for Colorectal Cancer Pathology Image Analysis: A Systematic Review,Nishant Thakur,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers requiring early pathologic diagnosis using colonoscopy biopsy samples. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress and shown promising results in the field of medicine despite several limitations. We performed a systematic review of AI use in CRC pathology image analysis to visualize the state-of-the-art. Studies published between January 2000 and January 2020 were searched in major online databases including MEDLINE (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE). Query terms included ""colorectal neoplasm,"" ""histology,"" and ""artificial intelligence."" Of 9000 identified studies, only 30 studies consisting of 40 models were selected for review. The algorithm features of the models were gland segmentation (n = 25, 62%), tumor classification (n = 8, 20%), tumor microenvironment characterization (n = 4, 10%), and prognosis prediction (n = 3, 8%). Only 20 gland segmentation models met the criteria for quantitative analysis, and the model proposed by Ding et al. (2019) performed the best. Studies with other features were in the elementary stage, although most showed impressive results. Overall, the state-of-the-art is promising for CRC pathological analysis. However, datasets in most studies had relatively limited scale and quality for clinical application of this technique. Future studies with larger datasets and high-quality annotations are required for routine practice-level validation."

32668545,Maternal cadmium exposure and neurobehavior in children: The HOME study,Weili Yang,"Background: It is unclear whether cadmium (Cd) exposure during fetal brain development is associated with child neurobehavior. Objective: To examine the potential associations between Cd exposure during pregnancy and neurobehavior among children. Methods: We used data from 276 children in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study, a well-established prospective pregnancy and birth cohort. We measured maternal urinary Cd concentrations at 26 weeks of gestation. For cognitive function, we assessed Mental Development Index (MDI) and Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II, the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence-III, or the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-IV at ages 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 years. We assessed child behaviors using the Behavior Assessment System for Children-2 at ages 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 years, yielding four composite measures: Externalizing Problems, Internalizing Problems, Behavioral Symptoms Index, and Adaptive Skills. We used linear mixed models with covariate adjustment to estimate the associations between maternal urinary Cd concentrations and child neurobehavior. Results: We categorized study participants into three groups based on maternal urinary Cd concentrations (Group 1: < limit of detection (LOD), Group 2: 0.06-0.22 μg/g creatinine, Group 3: ＞0.22 μg/g creatinine). In linear mixed models adjusting for maternal and child characteristics, maternal urinary Cd levels were not significantly associated with cognitive function at ages 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 years or with behavioral composite measures at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 years. Conclusions: No significant associations were observed between maternal urinary Cd and cognitive or behavioral measures in children at 1-8 years of age in this study."
32668529,The Future of Capsule Endoscopy: The Role of Artificial Intelligence and Other Technical Advancements,Young Joo Yang,"Capsule endoscopy has revolutionized the management of small-bowel diseases owing to its convenience and noninvasiveness. Capsule endoscopy is a common method for the evaluation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, Crohn's disease, small-bowel tumors, and polyposis syndrome. However, the laborious reading process, oversight of small-bowel lesions, and lack of locomotion are major obstacles to expanding its application. Along with recent advances in artificial intelligence, several studies have reported the promising performance of convolutional neural network systems for the diagnosis of various small-bowel lesions including erosion/ulcers, angioectasias, polyps, and bleeding lesions, which have reduced the time needed for capsule endoscopy interpretation. Furthermore, colon capsule endoscopy and capsule endoscopy locomotion driven by magnetic force have been investigated for clinical application, and various capsule endoscopy prototypes for active locomotion, biopsy, or therapeutic approaches have been introduced. In this review, we will discuss the recent advancements in artificial intelligence in the field of capsule endoscopy, as well as studies on other technological improvements in capsule endoscopy."
32668177,Beyond Risk-Based Stratification: Impacts of Processing Speed and Executive Function on Adaptive Skills in Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivors,Clifton P Thornton,"Purpose: The number of adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of childhood cancer is increasing, and the impacts of therapy on their daily lives are not well understood. Adaptive functions are required for age-appropriate interactions and day to day functioning, but are reduced in AYA survivors. Work in other pediatric populations suggests that additional neurocognitive skills may influence adaptive function and, thus, quality of life and personal attainment of AYA cancer survivors. Methods: Retrospective medical records review examined neurocognitive data from 139 AYA survivors. Hierarchical linear regression examined age at diagnosis, use of central nervous system (CNS) radiation, verbal intelligence, processing speed, and executive function as predictors of adaptive functioning domains. Results: AYA survivors exhibited weaknesses in all domains of adaptive functioning compared to normative reference values (Cohen's d = 0.660-0.864), as well as in processing speed (Cohen's d = 0.791) and metacognitive executive functioning (Cohen's d = 0.817). Processing speed and executive function provided substantial improvements in prediction of adaptive functioning beyond that of age at diagnosis and use of CNS-directed radiation therapy. Taken together these variables explained 37.1% of variability in adaptive conceptual skills, 26.1% in adaptive social skills, and 27.1% of adaptive practical skills. Conclusions: Intelligence, processing speed, and executive function significantly contribute to adaptive function scores in AYA cancer survivors and impact domains that are important to self-sufficiency and quality of life. Attention to neurocognitive function in all AYA cancer survivors is recommended in addition to referral for neuropsychological evaluation and tailoring interventions to address executive and adaptive functioning."
32667779,Triode-Mimicking Graphene Pressure Sensor with Positive Resistance Variation for Physiology and Motion Monitoring,Qi Wu,"The flexible pressure sensor is one of the essential components of the wearable device, which is a critical solution to the applications of artificial intelligence and human-computer interactions in the future. Due to its simple manufacturing process and measurement methods, research related to piezoresistive mechanical sensors is booming, and those sensors are already widely used in industry. However, existing pressure sensors are almost all based on negative resistance variations, making it difficult to reach a balance between the sensitivity and the detection range. Here, we demonstrated a low-cost flexible pressure sensor with a positive resistance-pressure response based on laser scribing graphene. The sensor can be customized and modulated to achieve both an ultrahigh sensitivity and a broad detection range. Furthermore, the device possesses the signal amplification property like a mechanical triode under the external pressure bias. Based on its amplification ability, varieties of physiological signals and human movements have been detected using our devices; then, an integrated gait monitoring system has been realized. The reported positive graphene pressure sensor has outstanding capability, showing a wide application range such as intelligent perception, an interactive device, and real-time health/motion monitoring."
32667292,Empathy and stress: the mediating impact of the emotional labor strategies on the example of surgical nurses],Maciej Załuski,"Background: The nurse, when performing emotional labor at work, tunes her own emotions to the patient's expectations. The self-regulation strategies which are then used weaken her mental strength and contribute to various symptoms of occupational burnout syndrome (OBS). In addition, certain positive relationships have been found between selected emotional labor strategies and increased work engagement. The skills of empathizing with the patient are the nurse's protective resource. Empathy allows to share emotions with the patient while maintaining the attitude of a neutral observer. It also helps to take actions to reduce pain and suffering, and to build a relationship of mutual trust and cooperation. The purpose of the present study, conducted in a group of surgical nurses in January‒March 2019, was to analyze a theoretical model which assumed the mediating role of emotional labor strategies in the relationship between empathy and OBS. Material and methods: The sample consisted of 84 surgical nurses employed at the University Hospital in Kraków. A cross-sectional design was used with the application of a questionnaire method. In the study, the Polish version of the Link Burnout Questionnaire by Jaworowska was used, together with the Empathy Quotient - short by Jankowiak-Siuda and the Deep Acting and Surface Acting Scale by Finogenow. For the statistical analysis, the IMB SPSS Statistics 24 with Hayes PROCESS version 3.4 was employed. Results: A negative correlation between the level of empathy and the severity of OBS symptoms was confirmed in the study. The use of the surface regulation strategies of emotional labor weakened the protective effect of empathy on burnout. The use of deep action processing strategies of emotional labor supported this relationship. Conclusions: The flexible use of emotional self-regulation strategies by the medical staff deepens their personal contact with the patient, and mediates in the level of empathy and the severity of OBS symptoms.

32666395,Automated detection and quantification of COVID-19 pneumonia: CT imaging analysis by a deep learning-based software,Hai-Tao Zhang,"Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging worldwide threat to public health. While chest computed tomography (CT) plays an indispensable role in its diagnosis, the quantification and localization of lesions cannot be accurately assessed manually. We employed deep learning-based software to aid in detection, localization and quantification of COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: A total of 2460 RT-PCR tested SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (1250 men and 1210 women; mean age, 57.7 ± 14.0 years (age range, 11-93 years) were retrospectively identified from Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan from February 11 to March 16, 2020. Basic clinical characteristics were reviewed. The uAI Intelligent Assistant Analysis System was used to assess the CT scans. Results: CT scans of 2215 patients (90%) showed multiple lesions of which 36 (1%) and 50 patients (2%) had left and right lung infections, respectively (> 50% of each affected lung's volume), while 27 (1%) had total lung infection (> 50% of the total volume of both lungs). Overall, 298 (12%), 778 (32%) and 1300 (53%) patients exhibited pure ground glass opacities (GGOs), GGOs with sub-solid lesions and GGOs with both sub-solid and solid lesions, respectively. Moreover, 2305 (94%) and 71 (3%) patients presented primarily with GGOs and sub-solid lesions, respectively. Elderly patients (≥ 60 years) were more likely to exhibit sub-solid lesions. The generalized linear mixed model showed that the dorsal segment of the right lower lobe was the favoured site of COVID-19 pneumonia. Conclusion: Chest CT combined with analysis by the uAI Intelligent Assistant Analysis System can accurately evaluate pneumonia in COVID-19 patients."
32666160,Characterization of Controlled Release Microspheres Using FIB-SEM and Image-Based Release Prediction,Shawn Zhang,"For polymer-based controlled release drug products (e.g. microspheres and implants), active pharmaceutical ingredient distribution and microporosity inside the polymer matrix are critical for product performance, particularly drug release kinetics. Due to the decreasing domain size and increasing complexity of such products, conventional characterization and release test techniques are limited by their resolution and speed. In this study, samples of controlled release poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres in the diameter range of 30-80 μm are investigated with focused ion beam scanning electron microscope imaging at 20 nm or higher resolution. Image data is quantified with artificial intelligence-based image analytics to provide size distributions of drug particles and pores within the microsphere sample. With an innovative image-based numerical simulation method, release profiles are predicted in a matter of days regardless of the designed release time. A mechanistic understanding on the impact of porosity to the interplays of drug, formulation, process, and dissolution was gained."
32665978,Artificial intelligence to improve back pain outcomes and lessons learnt from clinical classification approaches: three systematic reviews,Scott D Tagliaferri,"Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) could enhance the ability to detect patterns of clinical characteristics in low-back pain (LBP) and guide treatment. We conducted three systematic reviews to address the following aims: (a) review the status of AI/ML research in LBP, (b) compare its status to that of two established LBP classification systems (STarT Back, McKenzie). AI/ML in LBP is in its infancy: 45 of 48 studies assessed sample sizes <1000 people, 19 of 48 studies used ≤5 parameters in models, 13 of 48 studies applied multiple models and attained high accuracy, 25 of 48 studies assessed the binary classification of LBP versus no-LBP only. Beyond the 48 studies using AI/ML for LBP classification, no studies examined use of AI/ML in prognosis prediction of specific sub-groups, and AI/ML techniques are yet to be implemented in guiding LBP treatment. In contrast, the STarT Back tool has been assessed for internal consistency, test-retest reliability, validity, pain and disability prognosis, and influence on pain and disability treatment outcomes. McKenzie has been assessed for inter- and intra-tester reliability, prognosis, and impact on pain and disability outcomes relative to other treatments. For AI/ML methods to contribute to the refinement of LBP (sub-)classification and guide treatment allocation, large data sets containing known and exploratory clinical features should be examined. There is also a need to establish reliability, validity, and prognostic capacity of AI/ML techniques in LBP as well as its ability to inform treatment allocation for improved patient outcomes and/or reduced healthcare costs."
32665967,Machine learning to assist clinical decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic,Shubham Debnath,"Background: The number of cases from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has overwhelmed existing medical facilities and forced clinicians, patients, and families to make pivotal decisions with limited time and information. Main body: While machine learning (ML) methods have been previously used to augment clinical decisions, there is now a demand for ""Emergency ML."" Throughout the patient care pathway, there are opportunities for ML-supported decisions based on collected vitals, laboratory results, medication orders, and comorbidities. With rapidly growing datasets, there also remain important considerations when developing and validating ML models. Conclusion: This perspective highlights the utility of evidence-based prediction tools in a number of clinical settings, and how similar models can be deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic to guide hospital frontlines and healthcare administrators to make informed decisions about patient care and managing hospital volume."
32665754,Neuroimaging-Based Deep Learning in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,Jae-Won Song,"Deep learning (DL) is a kind of machine learning technique that uses artificial intelligence to identify the characteristics of given data and efficiently analyze large amounts of information to perform tasks such as classification and prediction. In the field of neuroimaging of neurodevelopmental disorders, various biomarkers for diagnosis, classification, prognosis prediction, and treatment response prediction have been examined; however, they have not been efficiently combined to produce meaningful results.

32665745,Single fiber OCT imager for breast tissue classification based on deep learning,Yuwei Liu,"We investigated a deep learning strategy to analyze optical coherence tomography image for accurate tissue characterization based on a single fiber OCT probe. We obtained OCT data from human breast tissue specimens. Using OCT data obtained from adipose breast tissue (normal tissue) and diseased tissue as confirmed in histology, we trained and validated a convolutional neural network (CNN) for accurate breast tissue classification. We demonstrated tumor margin identification based CNN classification of tissue at different spatial locations. We further demonstrated CNN tissue classification in OCT imaging based on a manually scanned single fiber probe. Our results demonstrated that OCT imaging capability integrated into a low-cost, disposable single fiber probe, along with sophisticated deep learning algorithms for tissue classification, allows minimally invasive tissue characterization, and can be used for cancer diagnosis or surgical margin assessment."
32665596,Integrating drone-borne thermal imaging with artificial intelligence to locate bird nests on agricultural land,Andrea Santangeli,"In conservation, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) carrying various sensors and the use of deep learning are increasing, but they are typically used independently of each other. Untapping their large potential requires integrating these tools. We combine drone-borne thermal imaging with artificial intelligence to locate ground-nests of birds on agricultural land. We show, for the first time, that this semi-automated system can identify nests with a high performance. However, local weather, type of arable field and height of the drone can affect performance. The results' implications are particularly relevant to conservation practitioners working across sectors, such as biodiversity conservation and food production in farmland. Under a rapidly changing world, studies like this can help uncover the potential of technology for conservation and embrace cross-sectoral transformations from the onset; for example, by integrating nest detection within the precision agriculture system that heavily relies on drone-borne sensors."

Methods: This paper evaluates the current methods in which video review is used for evaluation of surgical performance and identifies which processes are critical for successful, widespread implementation of video-based assessment. Results: Despite the advances in video capture technology and growing interest in video-based assessment, there is a notable gap in the implementation and longitudinal use of formative and summative assessment using video. Conclusion: Validity, scalability and discoverability are current but removable barriers to video-based assessment."
32664985,Managing COVID-19 within and across health systems: why we need performance intelligence to coordinate a global response,D Kringos,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is a complex global public health crisis presenting clinical, organisational and system-wide challenges. Different research perspectives on health are needed in order to manage and monitor this crisis. Performance intelligence is an approach that emphasises the need for different research perspectives in supporting health systems' decision-makers to determine policies based on well-informed choices. In this paper, we present the viewpoint of the Innovative Training Network for Healthcare Performance Intelligence Professionals (HealthPros) on how performance intelligence can be used during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: A lack of standardised information, paired with limited discussion and alignment between countries contribute to uncertainty in decision-making in all countries. Consequently, a plethora of different non-data-driven and uncoordinated approaches to address the outbreak are noted worldwide. Comparative health system research is needed to help countries shape their response models in social care, public health, primary care, hospital care and long-term care through the different phases of the pandemic. There is a need in each phase to compare context-specific bundles of measures where the impact on health outcomes can be modelled using targeted data and advanced statistical methods. Performance intelligence can be pursued to compare data, construct indicators and identify optimal strategies. Embracing a system perspective will allow countries to take coordinated strategic decisions while mitigating the risk of system collapse.A framework for the development and implementation of performance intelligence has been outlined by the HealthPros Network and is of pertinence. Health systems need better and more timely data to govern through a pandemic-induced transition period where tensions between care needs, demand and capacity are exceptionally high worldwide. Health systems are challenged to ensure essential levels of healthcare towards all patients, including those who need routine assistance. Conclusion: Performance intelligence plays an essential role as part of a broader public health strategy in guiding the decisions of health system actors on the implementation of contextualised measures to tackle COVID-19 or any future epidemic as well as their effect on the health system at large. This should be based on commonly agreed-upon standardised data and fit-for-purpose indicators, making optimal use of existing health information infrastructures. The HealthPros Network can make a meaningful contribution."
32664841,"Artificial Intelligence and Medicine: History, Current State, and Forecasts for the Future",Leonid N Yasnitsky,"This article traces the history of the development of artificial intelligence as a science that constantly responds to current problems that arise in medical practice. Attention is drawn to the fact that almost all modern neural systems of medical diagnostics are static. This means that they do not have a time axis, and therefore, can only make diagnoses of diseases at the current time. As a result, doctors have to make prescriptions for prevention and treatment courses without checking on computer models what this may lead to in the future. Thus, consciously or unconsciously, doctors have to experiment on patients, which is an ethical problem. This article shows that this centuriesold ethical problem can be solved by further development and application of modern methods of artificial intelligence. Optimal selection of prevention and treatment courses can be made by virtual predictive experimentation on dynamic computer models of patients."
32664744,Differentiation of Clinical Patterns Associated With Rhinologic Disease,Sean M Parsel,"Background: Common rhinologic diagnoses have similar presentations with a varying degree of overlap. Patterns may exist within clinical data that can be useful for early diagnosis and predicting outcomes. Objective: To explore the feasibility of artificial intelligence to differentiate patterns in patient data in order to develop clinically-meaningful diagnostic groups. Methods: A cross-sectional study of prospectively-acquired patient data at a tertiary rhinology clinic was performed. Data extracted included objective findings on nasal endoscopy, patient reported quality of life (PRQOL) instrument ratings, peripheral eosinophil fraction, and past medical history. Unsupervised non-hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to discover patterns in the data using 22 input variables. Results: A total of 545 patients were analyzed after application of inclusion and exclusion criteria yielding 7 unique patient clusters, highly dependent on PRQOL scores and demographics. The clusters were clinically-relevant with distinct characteristics. Chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP) was associated with two clusters having low frequencies of asthma and low eosinophil fractions. Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) was associated with high frequency of asthma, mean (standard deviation [SD]) NOSE scores of 66 (19) and SNOT-22 scores of 41 (15), and high eosinophil fractions. AR was present in multiple clusters. RARS was associated with the youngest population with mean (SD) NOSE score of 54 (23) and SNOT-22 score of 41 (19). Conclusion: Broader consideration of initially available clinical data may improve diagnostic efficiency for rhinologic conditions without ancillary studies, using computer-driven algorithms. PRQOL scores and demographic information appeared to be useful adjuncts, with associations to diagnoses in this pilot study."
32664432,Advanced Diabetes Management Using Artificial Intelligence and Continuous Glucose Monitoring Sensors,Martina Vettoretti,"Wearable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors are revolutionizing the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). These sensors provide in real-time, every 1-5 min, the current blood glucose concentration and its rate-of-change, two key pieces of information for improving the determination of exogenous insulin administration and the prediction of forthcoming adverse events, such as hypo-/hyper-glycemia. The current research in diabetes technology is putting considerable effort into developing decision support systems for patient use, which automatically analyze the patient's data collected by CGM sensors and other portable devices, as well as providing personalized recommendations about therapy adjustments to patients. Due to the large amount of data collected by patients with T1D and their variety, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are increasingly being adopted in these decision support systems. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art methodologies using AI and CGM sensors for decision support in advanced T1D management, including techniques for personalized insulin bolus calculation, adaptive tuning of bolus calculator parameters and glucose prediction."
32664367,Cerebral MRI and Clinical Findings in Children with PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome: Can Cerebral MRI Scan Help to Establish an Earlier Diagnosis of PHTS in Children?,Michaela Plamper,"Background: PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome (PHTS) is caused by germline autosomal-dominant mutations of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. Subjects harbour an increased risk for tumor development, with thyroid carcinoma occurring in young children. Establishing a diagnosis is challenging, since not all children fulfill diagnostic criteria established for adults. Macrocephaly is a common feature in childhood, with cerebral MRI being part of its diagnostic workup. We asked whether distinct cMRI features might facilitate an earlier diagnosis. Methods: We retrospectively studied radiological and clinical data of pediatric patients who were presented in our hospital between 2013 and 2019 in whom PTEN gene mutations were identified. Results: We included 27 pediatric patients (18 male) in the analysis. All patients were macrocephalic. Of these, 19 patients had received at least one cMRI scan. In 18 subjects variations were detected: enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS; in 18), white matter abnormalities (in seven) and less frequently additional pathologies. Intellectual ability was variable. Most patients exhibited developmental delay in motor skills, but normal intelligence. Conclusion: cMRI elucidates EPVS and white matter abnormalities in a high prevalence in children with PHTS and might therefore aid as a diagnostic feature to establish an earlier diagnosis of PHTS in childhood."
32664331,Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Automated Machine Learning on a National ICD-10 Database,Victor Olsavszky,"The application of machine learning (ML) for use in generating insights and making predictions on new records continues to expand within the medical community. Despite this progress to date, the application of time series analysis has remained underexplored due to complexity of the underlying techniques. In this study, we have deployed a novel ML, called automated time series (AutoTS) machine learning, to automate data processing and the application of a multitude of models to assess which best forecasts future values. This rapid experimentation allows for and enables the selection of the most accurate model in order to perform time series predictions. By using the nation-wide ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) dataset of hospitalized patients of Romania, we have generated time series datasets over the period of 2008-2018 and performed highly accurate AutoTS predictions for the ten deadliest diseases. Forecast results for the years 2019 and 2020 were generated on a NUTS 2 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) regional level. This is the first study to our knowledge to perform time series forecasting of multiple diseases at a regional level using automated time series machine learning on a national ICD-10 dataset. The deployment of AutoTS technology can help decision makers in implementing targeted national health policies more efficiently."
32664106,The level of GNE and its relationship with behavioral phenotypes in children with autism spectrum disorder,Xiaolei Yang,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious nervous system disease, and the cause is not known. Sialic acid (SA) is an indispensable nutrient for early brain development. In previous study, it was found that the SA level of ASD group was lower than that of control group. However, the reason for this has not well explained. A case-control study was conducted to understand the association between the SA synthase enzyme regulatory gene and ASD. The study sample included 65 ASD children and 64 healthy children. The levels of the GNE gene were measured, which encodes UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase (GNE), a key enzyme in SA biosynthesis. The symptom severity, intelligence development level, and behavioral performance of ASD children were estimated. There was a significant difference in the levels of GNE between the ASD and control groups (t = 2.028, P = .045). Moreover, the levels of GNE were negatively related to stereotypical behaviors according to the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) assessment (r = -0.386, P = .039). However, there is no the correlation between the levels of GNE and autistic severity. As evaluated through the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), the levels of GNE were negatively associated with autistic mannerisms scores, social cognition scores and SRS total scores in the children with ASD (r = -0.314, P = .020). These results indicate that the GNE gene may be associated with autism spectrum disorder, and it is also related to autistic behavioral performance, such as stereotypical behaviors, autistic mannerisms, and social cognition ability. Our data suggest that future studies to explore the causal relationship between GNE and the etiology of ASD may be needed."
34812339,Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data for Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Survey on the State-of-the-Arts,Quoc-Viet Pham,"The very first infected novel coronavirus case (COVID-19) was found in Hubei, China in Dec. 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread over 214 countries and areas in the world, and has significantly affected every aspect of our daily lives. At the time of writing this article, the numbers of infected cases and deaths still increase significantly and have no sign of a well-controlled situation, e.g., as of 13 July 2020, from a total number of around 13.1 million positive cases, 571,527 deaths were reported in the world. Motivated by recent advances and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data in various areas, this paper aims at emphasizing their importance in responding to the COVID-19 outbreak and preventing the severe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We firstly present an overview of AI and big data, then identify the applications aimed at fighting against COVID-19, next highlight challenges and issues associated with state-of-the-art solutions, and finally come up with recommendations for the communications to effectively control the COVID-19 situation. It is expected that this paper provides researchers and communities with new insights into the ways AI and big data improve the COVID-19 situation, and drives further studies in stopping the COVID-19 outbreak."
32663891,Technological Innovations in Pulmonology - Examples from Diagnostics and Therapy],W Randerath,"A significant proportion of the current technological developments in pneumology originate from the various areas of information technology. The spectrum ranges from smartphone apps to be used in daily life or in patient care to the use of artificial intelligence in screening and early detection of diseases. The diagnostic accuracy of apps for symptom analysis is currently very limited. Research projects are performed on the integration of symptoms and functional parameters into early detection, but also on mobility measurements as a prognostic marker in COPD. Lung cancer screening using computed tomography represents a major challenge. Here, artificial intelligence can help radiologists to cope with huge amounts of data. However, the quality of the software depends on the sufficient training of the system. Technological developments shape all fields of pneumology. For diagnostic and interventional endoscopy, they offer improved biopsy techniques and microstructural imaging. Advances in lung function measurements allow the differentiated analysis of respiratory mechanical disorders, and they could be transferred to ventilation technology. The translation of basic findings about the lung microbiome into patient care may perspectively help to better understand and treat COPD exacerbations."
32663813,Automatic IMRT planning via static field fluence prediction (AIP-SFFP): a deep learning algorithm for real-time prostate treatment planning,Xinyi Li,"The purpose of this work was to develop a deep learning (DL) based algorithm, Automatic intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) Planning via Static Field Fluence Prediction (AIP-SFFP), for automated prostate IMRT planning with real-time planning efficiency. The following method was adopted: AIP-SFFP generates a prostate IMRT plan through predictions of fluence maps using patient anatomy. No inverse planning is required. AIP-SFFP is centered on a custom-built deep learning (DL) neural network for fluence map prediction. Predictions are imported to a commercial treatment-planning system for dose calculation and plan generation. AIP-SFFP was demonstrated for prostate IMRT simultaneously-integrated-boost planning (58.8 Gy/70 Gy to PTV58.8 Gy/PTV70 Gy in 28 fx, PTV = Planning Target Volume). Training data was generated from 106 patients using a knowledge-based planning (KBP) plan generator. Two types of 2D projection images were designed to represent structures' sizes and locations, and a total of eight projections were utilized to describe targets and organs-at-risk. Projections at nine template beam angles were stacked as inputs for artificial intelligence (AI) training. 14 patients were used as independent tests. The generated test plans were compared with the plans from the KBP training plan generator and clinic practice. The following results were obtained: After normalization (PTV70 Gy V70 Gy = 95%), all 14 AI plans met institutional criteria. The coverage of PTV58.8 Gy in the AI plans was comparable to KBP and clinic plans without statistical significance. The whole body (BODY) D1cc and rectum D0.1cc of AI plans were slightly higher (<1 Gy) compared to KBP and clinic plans; in contrast, the bladder D1cc and other rectum and bladder low doses in the AI plans were slightly improved without clinical relevance. The overall isodose distribution in the AI plans was comparable with KBP plans and clinical plans. AIP-SFFP generated each test plan within 20s including the prediction and the dose calculation. In conclusion, AIP-SFFP was successfully developed for prostate IMRT planning. AIP-SFFP demonstrated good overall plan quality and real-time efficiency. Showing great promise, AIP-SFFP will be investigated for immediate clinical application."
32663794,Evaluation of emotional intelligence (EI) in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) patients compared to healthy individuals,Negar Ramezani,"Background: Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is known as an autoimmune astrocytopathic disorder involving central nervous system (CNS). The aim of this study was to compare Emotional Intelligence (EI) score between NMOSD patients and healthy individuals, and to find out the possible effect of this disease on EI. Methods: A total of 45 NMOSD participants and 48 healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Demographic information (e.g., gender and age) of all participants as well as their level of education, and data on the patients' duration of disease were collected. EI of each participant was assessed using Persian version of Emotional Quotient inventory (EQ-i) questionnaire. Results: The mean total EI score was significantly different between the participants and controls (322±36.7 vs 338±31.5, p value<0.03). Compared to controls, patients had a poor performance in 4 of 15 EI subscales including emotional self-awareness (21.29±3.6 vs 22.85±3, p value<0.03), optimism (22.4±4 vs 24.1±3.1, p value<0.03), self-regard (22.7±4.6 vs 24.5±3.4, p value<0.04), and impulse control (16.9±6.5 vs 19.5±5.5, p value<0.05). No difference was found between anti-aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-IgG) positive and AQP4-IgG negative patients regarding EI score or its subscale scores, except for self-actualization (p value<0.05). Conclusion: Our study showed that EI could be regarded as a tool for understanding emotions, thoughts, and behavior of NMOSD patients. It was implied that taking therapeutic steps could improve the performance of NMOSD patients with EI impairment in social life."
32663439,Deep Reinforcement Learning and Its Neuroscientific Implications,Matthew Botvinick,"The emergence of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) is defining new research directions in neuroscience. To date, this research has focused largely on deep neural networks trained using supervised learning in tasks such as image classification. However, there is another area of recent AI work that has so far received less attention from neuroscientists but that may have profound neuroscientific implications: deep reinforcement learning (RL). Deep RL offers a comprehensive framework for studying the interplay among learning, representation, and decision making, offering to the brain sciences a new set of research tools and a wide range of novel hypotheses. In the present review, we provide a high-level introduction to deep RL, discuss some of its initial applications to neuroscience, and survey its wider implications for research on brain and behavior, concluding with a list of opportunities for next-stage research."
32663146,Artificial Intelligence for Caregivers of Persons With Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias: Systematic Literature Review,Bo Xie,"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has great potential for improving the care of persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and the quality of life of their family caregivers. To date, however, systematic review of the literature on the impact of AI on ADRD management has been lacking. Objective: This paper aims to (1) identify and examine literature on AI that provides information to facilitate ADRD management by caregivers of individuals diagnosed with ADRD and (2) identify gaps in the literature that suggest future directions for research. Methods: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for conducting systematic literature reviews, during August and September 2019, we performed 3 rounds of selection. First, we searched predetermined keywords in PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus with Full Text, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and the ACM Digital Library. This step generated 113 nonduplicate results. Next, we screened the titles and abstracts of the 113 papers according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, after which 52 papers were excluded and 61 remained. Finally, we screened the full text of the remaining papers to ensure that they met the inclusion or exclusion criteria; 31 papers were excluded, leaving a final sample of 30 papers for analysis. Results: Of the 30 papers, 20 reported studies that focused on using AI to assist in activities of daily living. A limited number of specific daily activities were targeted. The studies' aims suggested three major purposes: (1) to test the feasibility, usability, or perceptions of prototype AI technology; (2) to generate preliminary data on the technology's performance (primarily accuracy in detecting target events, such as falls); and (3) to understand user needs and preferences for the design and functionality of to-be-developed technology. The majority of the studies were qualitative, with interviews, focus groups, and observation being their most common methods. Cross-sectional surveys were also common, but with small convenience samples. Sample sizes ranged from 6 to 106, with the vast majority on the low end. The majority of the studies were descriptive, exploratory, and lacking theoretical guidance. Many studies reported positive outcomes in favor of their AI technology's feasibility and satisfaction; some studies reported mixed results on these measures. Performance of the technology varied widely across tasks. Conclusions: These findings call for more systematic designs and evaluations of the feasibility and efficacy of AI-based interventions for caregivers of people with ADRD. These gaps in the research would be best addressed through interdisciplinary collaboration, incorporating complementary expertise from the health sciences and computer science/engineering-related fields."
32663047,"Trust in Autonomous Cars: Exploring the Role of Shared Moral Values, Reasoning, and Emotion in Safety-Critical Decisions",Ryosuke Yokoi,"Objective: Autonomous cars (ACs) controlled by artificial intelligence are expected to play a significant role in transportation in the near future. This study investigated determinants of trust in ACs. Background: Trust in ACs influences different variables, including the intention to adopt AC technology. Several studies on risk perception have verified that shared value determines trust in risk managers. Previous research has confirmed the effect of value similarity on trust in artificial intelligence. We focused on moral beliefs, specifically utilitarianism (belief in promoting a greater good) and deontology (belief in condemning deliberate harm), and tested the effects of shared moral beliefs on trust in ACs. Method: We conducted three experiments (N = 128, 71, and 196, for each), adopting a thought experiment similar to the well-known trolley problem. We manipulated shared moral beliefs (shared vs. unshared) and driver (AC vs. human), providing participants with different moral dilemma scenarios. Trust in ACs was measured through a questionnaire. Results: The results of Experiment 1 showed that shared utilitarian belief strongly influenced trust in ACs. In Experiment 2 and Experiment 3, however, we did not find statistical evidence that shared deontological belief had an effect on trust in ACs. Conclusion: The results of the three experiments suggest that the effect of shared moral beliefs on trust varies depending on the values that ACs share with humans. Application: To promote AC implementation, policymakers and developers need to understand which values are shared between ACs and humans to enhance trust in ACs."
