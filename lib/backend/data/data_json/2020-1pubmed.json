        "Title": "Pycnodysostosis",
        "Author": "Shannon LeBlanc",
        "Abstract": "Clinical characteristics: Pycnodysostosis is characterized by short-limbed short stature, typical facial appearance (convex nasal ridge and small jaw with obtuse mandibular angle), osteosclerosis with increased bone fragility, acroosteolysis of the distal phalanges, delayed closure of the cranial sutures, and dysplasia of the clavicle. In affected individuals, the facial features become more prominent with age, likely due to progressive acroosteolysis of the facial bones, but can usually be appreciated from early childhood, particularly the small jaw and convex nasal ridge. Additional features include dental and nail anomalies. Intelligence is typically normal with mild psychomotor difficulties reported in some individuals. Diagnosis/testing: The diagnosis of pycnodysostosis can be established in a proband with characteristic clinical and radiographic features and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in CTSK identified by molecular genetic testing. Management: Treatment of manifestations: Growth hormone therapy; environmental or occupational modifications as needed; orthopedic management of fractures and scoliosis; craniofacial and neurosurgical management as required for cleft palate, craniosynostosis, maxillary and mandibular hypoplasia; pulmonology and sleep medicine specialist management of obstruction sleep apnea; consultation with expert anesthetist prior to any planned surgery; dental and orthodontic care for dental anomalies; standard management per ophthalmologist for vision concerns. Surveillance: Annual physical examination including assessment for scoliosis, asymmetry, frequency of fractures, weight and nutrition, and psychological assessment; polysomnography every two years; annual evaluation with specialist dentist and ophthalmologist. Agents/circumstances to avoid: If general anesthesia is needed, consider the possibility of difficult intubation prior to scheduling anesthesia. Pregnancy management: In individuals with a small pelvis, delivery by cæsarean section should be considered. However, each individual should be assessed by an obstetrician and anesthetist familiar with skeletal dysplasia. Genetic counseling: Pycnodysostosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CTSK pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CTSK pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible."

        "Title": "Interpretation of Depression Detection Models via Feature Selection Methods",
        "Author": "Sharifa Alghowinem",
        "Abstract": "Given the prevalence of depression worldwide and its major impact on society, several studies employed artificial intelligence modelling to automatically detect and assess depression. However, interpretation of these models and cues are rarely discussed in detail in the AI community, but have received increased attention lately. In this study, we aim to analyse the commonly selected features using a proposed framework of several feature selection methods and their effect on the classification results, which will provide an interpretation of the depression detection model. The developed framework aggregates and selects the most promising features for modelling depression detection from 38 feature selection algorithms of different categories. Using three real-world depression datasets, 902 behavioural cues were extracted from speech behaviour, speech prosody, eye movement and head pose. To verify the generalisability of the proposed framework, we applied the entire process to depression datasets individually and when combined. The results from the proposed framework showed that speech behaviour features (e.g. pauses) are the most distinctive features of the depression detection model. From the speech prosody modality, the strongest feature groups were F0, HNR, formants, and MFCC, while for the eye activity modality they were left-right eye movement and gaze direction, and for the head modality it was yaw head movement. Modelling depression detection using the selected features (even though there are only 9 features) outperformed using all features in all the individual and combined datasets. Our feature selection framework did not only provide an interpretation of the model, but was also able to produce a higher accuracy of depression detection with a small number of features in varied datasets. This could help to reduce the processing time needed to extract features and creating the model."

        "Author": "Daniel Aristizábal-Torres",
        "Abstract": "Objective: Design and implement an interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in Colombia. Methods: A tool was designed and implemented to analyze the data of Covid-19 positive cases in Colombia and published by the Instituto Nacional de Salud. The tool is based on the implementation of business intelligence methods with which you can understand the behavior of the pandemic in Colombia and generate structured data for decision-making by government levels. The tool displays, on a single screen, information on the number of cases, patient status, age ranges, city, location department, and gender. This information can be dynamically filtered and focus analyzes on the national, departmental, or municipal order. Additionally, methods are implemented for trend analysis, both on a linear and semi-log scale, as well as for calculating the case fatality rate in each of the municipalities. Results: A web-based data analysis dashboard is implemented for semi-continuous monitoring of the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia. With the use of the tool, a situational analysis is carried out for five of the most important cities in Colombia. Conclusions: The application is effective, flexible, and easy to use. The situational analysis reflects that public policies for the control of the disease have been favorable for Medellín, but for Cartagena, Bogotá, Barranquilla, and Cali, complementary measures are required."

        "Title": "Comparing definitions of data and information in data protection law and machine learning: A useful way forward to meaningfully regulate algorithms?",
        "Author": "Raphaël Gellert",
        "Abstract": "The notion of information is central to data protection law, and to algorithms/machine learning. This centrality gives the impressions that algorithms are just yet another data processing operation to be regulated. A more careful analysis reveals a number of issues. The notion of personal data is notoriously under-defined, and attempts at clarification from an information theory perspective are also equivocal. The paper therefore attempts a clarification of the meaning of data and information in the context of information theory, which it uses in order to clarify the notion of personal data. In doing so, it shows that data protection law is grounded in the logic of knowledge communication, which stands in stark contrast with machine learning, which is predicated upon the logic of knowledge production, and hence, upon different definitions of data and information. This is what ultimately explains the failure of data protection to adequately regulate machine learning algorithms."

        "Author": "Emmy de Kraker-Pauw",
        "Abstract": "Important adolescents' career-related decisions might be influenced by their beliefs about malleability of intelligence and learning (mindset). We combined quantitative and qualitative data to provide in-depth insights in the beliefs that 13-14-year-olds hold about learning and intelligence, the factors influencing these beliefs, and the consequences of these beliefs in relation to classroom behaviour and study choices. To establish students' mindsets quantitatively, we categorised theory of intelligence questionnaire (TOI; Dweck, 1999) averaged scores into three levels: entity, intermediate or incremental mindsets, to provide insight into the distribution of the different mindset types in our sample (N = 492). The results of this quantitative study show that more than half of the students believed intelligence is \"fixed\" (entity mindset), these data showed no effect of gender. To gain more in-depth insight in the views of these students, focus groups about mindset and its influences and consequences were held in a subsample (n = 176). The qualitative data provide more nuanced insights, for example they reveal subtle gender differences regarding effort beliefs and motivation. Integrated discussion of the quantitative and qualitative results demonstrates that this multi-method approach reflects the complexity of the concept mindset better than only the widely used TOI questionnaire."

        "Abstract": "Inspired by the information transmission mechanism in the central nervous systems of life, synapse-mimicking devices have been designed and fabricated for the purpose of breaking the bottleneck of von Neumann architecture and realizing the construction of effective hardware-based artificial intelligence. In this case, synaptic iontronic devices, dealing with current information with ions instead of electrons, have attracted enormous scientific interests owing to their unique characteristics provided by ions, such as the designability of charge carriers and the diversity of chemical regulation. Herein, the basic conception, working mechanism, performance metrics, and advanced applications of synaptic iontronic devices based on three-terminal transistors and two-terminal memristors are systematically reviewed and comprehensively discussed. This Review provides a prospect on how to realize artificial synaptic functions based on the regulation of ions and raises a series of further challenges unsolved in this area."

        "Author": "Dylan Molenaar",
        "Abstract": "Effort has been devoted to the development of moderated factor models in which the traditional factor model parameters are allowed to differ across a moderator variable. These models are valuable as they enable tests on measurement invariance across a continuous background variable. However, moderated factor models require the specification of a parametric functional form between the factor model parameters and the moderator variable while, in some situations, it is unclear what functional form to assume. Therefore, in the present article, a semiparametric moderated factor modeling approach is presented in which no assumption concerning the functional form between the moderator and the model parameters is imposed. In a simulation study, the semiparametric moderated factor model is shown to be viable in terms of parameter recovery and the power to distinguish the different models for measurement invariance. In addition, the model is applied to a real dataset pertaining to intelligence. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)."

        "Title": "What is Interpretability?",
        "Author": "Adrian Erasmus",
        "Abstract": "We argue that artificial networks are explainable and offer a novel theory of interpretability. Two sets of conceptual questions are prominent in theoretical engagements with artificial neural networks, especially in the context of medical artificial intelligence: (1) Are networks explainable, and if so, what does it mean to explain the output of a network? And (2) what does it mean for a network to be interpretable? We argue that accounts of \"explanation\" tailored specifically to neural networks have ineffectively reinvented the wheel. In response to (1), we show how four familiar accounts of explanation apply to neural networks as they would to any scientific phenomenon. We diagnose the confusion about explaining neural networks within the machine learning literature as an equivocation on \"explainability,\" \"understandability\" and \"interpretability.\" To remedy this, we distinguish between these notions, and answer (2) by offering a theory and typology of interpretation in machine learning. Interpretation is something one does to an explanation with the aim of producing another, more understandable, explanation. As with explanation, there are various concepts and methods involved in interpretation: Total or Partial, Global or Local, and Approximative or Isomorphic. Our account of \"interpretability\" is consistent with uses in the machine learning literature, in keeping with the philosophy of explanation and understanding, and pays special attention to medical artificial intelligence systems."

        "Author": "Changrong Shi",
        "Abstract": "Assessing cancer response to therapeutic interventions has been realized as an important course to early predict curative efficacy and treatment outcomes due to tumor heterogeneity. Compared to the traditional invasive tissue biopsy method, molecular imaging techniques have fundamentally revolutionized the ability to evaluate cancer response in a spatiotemporal manner. The past few years has witnessed a paradigm shift on the efforts from manufacturing functional molecular imaging probes for seeing a tumor to a vantage stage of interpreting the tumor response during different treatments. This review is to stand by the current development of advanced imaging technologies aiming to predict the treatment response in cancer therapy. Special interest is placed on the systems that are able to provide rapid and noninvasive assessment of pharmacokinetic drug fates (e.g., drug distribution, release, and activation) and tumor microenvironment heterogeneity (e.g., tumor cells, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, and inflammatory cells). The current status, practical significance, and future challenges of the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technology and machine learning in the applications of medical imaging fields is overviewed. Ultimately, the authors hope that this review is timely to spur research interest in molecular imaging and precision medicine."

        "Author": "Junli Du",
        "Abstract": "Flexible optoelectronics, as promising components hold shape-adaptive features and dynamic strain response under strain engineering for various intelligent applications. 2D materials with atomically thin layers are ideal for flexible optoelectronics because of their high flexibility and strain sensitivity. However, how the strain affects the performance of 2D materials-based flexible optoelectronics is confused due to their hypersensitive features to external strain changes. It is necessary to establish an evaluation system to comprehend the influence of the external strain on the intrinsic properties of 2D materials and the photoresponse performance of their flexible optoelectronics. Here, a focused review of strain engineering in 2D materials-based flexible optoelectronics is provided. The first attention is on the mechanical properties and the strain-engineered electronic properties of 2D semiconductors. An evaluation system with relatively comprehensive parameters in functionality and service capability is summarized to develop 2D materials-based flexible optoelectronics in practical application. Based on the parameters, some strategies to improve the functionality and service capability are proposed. Finally, combining with strain engineering in future intelligence devices, the challenges and future perspective developing 2D materials-based flexible optoelectronics are expounded."

        "Title": "Transparency as design publicity: explaining and justifying inscrutable algorithms",
        "Author": "Michele Loi",
        "Abstract": "In this paper we argue that transparency of machine learning algorithms, just as explanation, can be defined at different levels of abstraction. We criticize recent attempts to identify the explanation of black box algorithms with making their decisions (post-hoc) interpretable, focusing our discussion on counterfactual explanations. These approaches to explanation simplify the real nature of the black boxes and risk misleading the public about the normative features of a model. We propose a new form of algorithmic transparency, that consists in explaining algorithms as an intentional product, that serves a particular goal, or multiple goals (Daniel Dennet's design stance) in a given domain of applicability, and that provides a measure of the extent to which such a goal is achieved, and evidence about the way that measure has been reached. We call such idea of algorithmic transparency \"design publicity.\" We argue that design publicity can be more easily linked with the justification of the use and of the design of the algorithm, and of each individual decision following from it. In comparison to post-hoc explanations of individual algorithmic decisions, design publicity meets a different demand (the demand for impersonal justification) of the explainee. Finally, we argue that when models that pursue justifiable goals (which may include fairness as avoidance of bias towards specific groups) to a justifiable degree are used consistently, the resulting decisions are all justified even if some of them are (unavoidably) based on incorrect predictions. For this argument, we rely on John Rawls's idea of procedural justice applied to algorithms conceived as institutions."

        "Abstract": "Background: Computer vision can measure movement from video without the time and access limitations of hospital accelerometry/electromyography or the requirement to hold or strap a smartphone accelerometer. Objective: To compare computer vision measurement of hand tremor frequency from smartphone video with a gold standard measure accelerometer. Methods: A total of 37 smartphone videos of hands, at rest and in posture, were recorded from 15 participants with tremor diagnoses (9 Parkinson's disease, 5 essential tremor, 1 functional tremor). Video pixel movement was measured using the computing technique of optical flow, with contemporaneous accelerometer recording. Fast Fourier transform and Bland-Altman analysis were applied. Tremor amplitude was scored by 2 clinicians. Results: Bland-Altman analysis of dominant tremor frequency from smartphone video compared with accelerometer showed excellent agreement: 95% limits of agreement -0.38 Hz to +0.35 Hz. In 36 of 37 videos (97%), there was <0.5 Hz difference between computer vision and accelerometer measurement. There was no significant correlation between the level of agreement and tremor amplitude. Conclusion: The study suggests a potential new, contactless point-and-press measure of tremor frequency within standard clinical settings, research studies, or telemedicine."

        "Abstract": "In this study, the Intelligent Infectious Diseases Algorithm (IIDA) has been developed to locate the sources of infection and survival rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in order to propose health care routes for population affected by COVID-19. The main goal of this computational algorithm is to reduce the spread of the virus and decrease the number of infected people. To do so, health care routes are generated according to the priority of certain population groups. The algorithm was applied to New York state data. Based on infection rates and reported deaths, hot spots were determined by applying the kernel density estimation (KDE) to the groups that have been previously obtained using a clustering algorithm together with the elbow method. For each cluster, the survival rate -the key information to prioritize medical care- was determined using the proportional hazards model. Finally, ant colony optimization (ACO) and the traveling salesman problem (TSP) optimization algorithms were applied to identify the optimal route to the closest hospital. The results obtained efficiently covered the points with the highest concentration of COVID-19 cases. In this way, its spread can be prevented and health resources optimized."

        "Abstract": "Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a pre-cancerous lesion in the ducts of the breast, and early diagnosis is crucial for optimal therapeutic intervention. Thermography imaging is a non-invasive imaging tool that can be utilized for detection of DCIS and although it has high accuracy (~ 88%), it is sensitivity can still be improved. Hence, we aimed to develop an automated artificial intelligence-based system for improved detection of DCIS in thermographs. This study proposed a novel artificial intelligence based system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) termed CNN-BDER on a multisource dataset containing 240 DCIS images and 240 healthy breast images. Based on CNN, batch normalization, dropout, exponential linear unit and rank-based weighted pooling were integrated, along with L-way data augmentation. Ten runs of tenfold cross validation were chosen to report the unbiased performances. Our proposed method achieved a sensitivity of 94.08 ± 1.22%, a specificity of 93.58 ± 1.49 and an accuracy of 93.83 ± 0.96. The proposed method gives superior performance than eight state-of-the-art approaches and manual diagnosis. The trained model could serve as a visual question answering system and improve diagnostic accuracy."

Robots are a promising technology for providing many tasks such as spraying, disinfection, cleaning, treating, detecting high body temperature/mask absence, and delivering goods and medical supplies experiencing an epidemic COVID-19. For combating COVID-19, many heterogeneous and homogenous robots are required to perform different tasks for supporting different purposes in the quarantine area. Managmnt and decentralizing multi-robot play a vital role in combating COVID-19 by reducing human interaction, monitoring, delivering goods. Blockchain technology can manage multi-robot collaboration in a decentralized fashion, improve the interaction among them to exchange information, share representation, share goals, and trust. We highlight the challenges and provide the tactical solutions enabled by integrating blockchain and multi-robot collaboration to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed conceptual framework can increase the intelligence, decentralization, and autonomous operations of connected multi-robot collaboration in the blockchain network. We overview blockchain potential benefits to defining a framework of multi-robot collaboration applications to combat COVID-19 epidemics such as monitoring and outdoor and hospital End to End (E2E) delivery systems. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of integrated blockchain, multi-robot collaboration, and the Internet of Things (IoT) for combating COVID-19 and future pandemics."

        "Author": "Julian D Arias-Londono",
        "Abstract": "Current standard protocols used in the clinic for diagnosing COVID-19 include molecular or antigen tests, generally complemented by a plain chest X-Ray. The combined analysis aims to reduce the significant number of false negatives of these tests and provide complementary evidence about the presence and severity of the disease. However, the procedure is not free of errors, and the interpretation of the chest X-Ray is only restricted to radiologists due to its complexity. With the long term goal to provide new evidence for the diagnosis, this paper presents an evaluation of different methods based on a deep neural network. These are the first steps to develop an automatic COVID-19 diagnosis tool using chest X-Ray images to differentiate between controls, pneumonia, or COVID-19 groups. The paper describes the process followed to train a Convolutional Neural Network with a dataset of more than 79, 500 X-Ray images compiled from different sources, including more than 8, 500 COVID-19 examples. Three different experiments following three preprocessing schemes are carried out to evaluate and compare the developed models. The aim is to evaluate how preprocessing the data affects the results and improves its explainability. Likewise, a critical analysis of different variability issues that might compromise the system and its effects is performed. With the employed methodology, a 91.5% classification accuracy is obtained, with an 87.4% average recall for the worst but most explainable experiment, which requires a previous automatic segmentation of the lung region."

        "Author": "K Shankar",
        "Abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic is increasing in an exponential rate, with restricted accessibility of rapid test kits. So, the design and implementation of COVID-19 testing kits remain an open research problem. Several findings attained using radio-imaging approaches recommend that the images comprise important data related to coronaviruses. The application of recently developed artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, integrated with radiological imaging, is helpful in the precise diagnosis and classification of the disease. In this view, the current research paper presents a novel fusion model hand-crafted with deep learning features called FM-HCF-DLF model for diagnosis and classification of COVID-19. The proposed FM-HCF-DLF model comprises three major processes, namely Gaussian filtering-based preprocessing, FM for feature extraction and classification. FM model incorporates the fusion of handcrafted features with the help of local binary patterns (LBP) and deep learning (DL) features and it also utilizes convolutional neural network (CNN)-based Inception v3 technique. To further improve the performance of Inception v3 model, the learning rate scheduler using Adam optimizer is applied. At last, multilayer perceptron (MLP) is employed to carry out the classification process. The proposed FM-HCF-DLF model was experimentally validated using chest X-ray dataset. The experimental outcomes inferred that the proposed model yielded superior performance with maximum sensitivity of 93.61%, specificity of 94.56%, precision of 94.85%, accuracy of 94.08%, F score of 93.2% and kappa value of 93.5%."

        "Abstract": "Pathology plays a very important role in cancer diagnosis. The rapid development of digital pathology (DP) based on whole slide image (WSI) has led to many improvements in computer-assisted diagnosis by artificial intelligence. The common digitization strategy is to scan the pathology slice with 20× or 40× objective, and the 40× objective requires excessive storage space and transmission time, which are significant negative factors in the popularization of DP. In this article, we present a novel reconstructed high-resolution (HR) process based on deep learning to switch 20 × WSI to 40 × without the loss of whole and local features. Furthermore, we collected the WSI data of 100 uterine leiomyosarcomas and 100 adult granulosa cell tumors to test our reconstructed HR process. We tested the reconstructed HR WSI by the peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, and the blind/reject image spatial quality evaluator, which were 42.03, 0.99, and 49.22, respectively. Subsequently, we confirmed the consistency between the actual and our reconstructed HR images. The testing results indicate that the reconstructed HR imaging is a reliable method for the digital slides of a variety of tumors and can be available on a large scale in clinical pathology as an innovative technique."

        "Author": "Mugahed A Al-Antari",
        "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel harmful respiratory disease that has rapidly spread worldwide. At the end of 2019, COVID-19 emerged as a previously unknown respiratory disease in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The world health organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic in the second week of March 2020. Simultaneous deep learning detection and classification of COVID-19 based on the full resolution of digital X-ray images is the key to efficiently assisting patients by enabling physicians to reach a fast and accurate diagnosis decision. In this paper, a simultaneous deep learning computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on the YOLO predictor is proposed that can detect and diagnose COVID-19, differentiating it from eight other respiratory diseases: atelectasis, infiltration, pneumothorax, masses, effusion, pneumonia, cardiomegaly, and nodules. The proposed CAD system was assessed via five-fold tests for the multi-class prediction problem using two different databases of chest X-ray images: COVID-19 and ChestX-ray8. The proposed CAD system was trained with an annotated training set of 50,490 chest X-ray images. The regions on the entire X-ray images with lesions suspected of being due to COVID-19 were simultaneously detected and classified end-to-end via the proposed CAD predictor, achieving overall detection and classification accuracies of 96.31% and 97.40%, respectively. Most test images from patients with confirmed COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases were correctly predicted, achieving average intersection over union (IoU) greater than 90%. Applying deep learning regularizers of data balancing and augmentation improved the COVID-19 diagnostic performance by 6.64% and 12.17% in terms of the overall accuracy and the F1-score, respectively. It is feasible to achieve a diagnosis based on individual chest X-ray images with the proposed CAD system within 0.0093 s. Thus, the CAD system presented in this paper can make a prediction at the rate of 108 frames/s (FPS), which is close to real-time. The proposed deep learning CAD system can reliably differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory diseases. The proposed deep learning model seems to be a reliable tool that can be used to practically assist health care systems, patients, and physicians."

        "Title": "FaNet: fast assessment network for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia based on 3D CT imaging and clinical symptoms",
        "Author": "Zhenxing Huang",
        "Abstract": "The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia has become a serious health challenge in countries worldwide. Many radiological findings have shown that X-ray and CT imaging scans are an effective solution to assess disease severity during the early stage of COVID-19. Many artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted diagnosis works have rapidly been proposed to focus on solving this classification problem and determine whether a patient is infected with COVID-19. Most of these works have designed networks and applied a single CT image to perform classification; however, this approach ignores prior information such as the patient's clinical symptoms. Second, making a more specific diagnosis of clinical severity, such as slight or severe, is worthy of attention and is conducive to determining better follow-up treatments. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL) based dual-tasks network, named FaNet, that can perform rapid both diagnosis and severity assessments for COVID-19 based on the combination of 3D CT imaging and clinical symptoms. Generally, 3D CT image sequences provide more spatial information than do single CT images. In addition, the clinical symptoms can be considered as prior information to improve the assessment accuracy; these symptoms are typically quickly and easily accessible to radiologists. Therefore, we designed a network that considers both CT image information and existing clinical symptom information and conducted experiments on 416 patient data, including 207 normal chest CT cases and 209 COVID-19 confirmed ones. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the additional symptom prior information as well as the network architecture designing. The proposed FaNet achieved an accuracy of 98.28% on diagnosis assessment and 94.83% on severity assessment for test datasets. In the future, we will collect more covid-CT patient data and seek further improvement."

        "Author": "Huseyin Yasar",
        "Abstract": "In this study, which aims at early diagnosis of Covid-19 disease using X-ray images, the deep-learning approach, a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence method, was used, and automatic classification of images was performed using convolutional neural networks (CNN). In the first training-test data set used in the study, there were 230 X-ray images, of which 150 were Covid-19 and 80 were non-Covid-19, while in the second training-test data set there were 476 X-ray images, of which 150 were Covid-19 and 326 were non-Covid-19. Thus, classification results have been provided for two data sets, containing predominantly Covid-19 images and predominantly non-Covid-19 images, respectively. In the study, a 23-layer CNN architecture and a 54-layer CNN architecture were developed. Within the scope of the study, the results were obtained using chest X-ray images directly in the training-test procedures and the sub-band images obtained by applying dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) to the above-mentioned images. The same experiments were repeated using images obtained by applying local binary pattern (LBP) to the chest X-ray images. Within the scope of the study, four new result generation pipeline algorithms having been put forward additionally, it was ensured that the experimental results were combined and the success of the study was improved. In the experiments carried out in this study, the training sessions were carried out using the k-fold cross validation method. Here the k value was chosen as 23 for the first and second training-test data sets. Considering the average highest results of the experiments performed within the scope of the study, the values of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the first training-test data set were 0,9947, 0,9800, 0,9843, 0,9881 and 0,9990 respectively; while for the second training-test data set, they were 0,9920, 0,9939, 0,9891, 0,9828 and 0,9991; respectively. Within the scope of the study, finally, all the images were combined and the training and testing processes were repeated for a total of 556 X-ray images comprising 150 Covid-19 images and 406 non-Covid-19 images, by applying 2-fold cross. In this context, the average highest values of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-1 score, and AUC for this last training-test data set were found to be 0,9760, 1,0000, 0,9906, 0,9823 and 0,9997; respectively."

        "Abstract": "Meteorological parameters were crucial and effective factors in past infectious diseases, like influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), etc. The present study targets to explore the association between the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission rates and meteorological parameters. For this purpose, the meteorological parameters and COVID-19 infection data from 28th March 2020 to 22nd April 2020 of different states of India have been compiled and used in the analysis. The gradient boosting model (GBM) has been implemented to explore the effect of the minimum temperature, maximum temperature, minimum humidity, and maximum humidity on the infection count of COVID-19. The optimal performance of the GBM model has been achieved after tuning its parameters. The GBM results in the best accuracy of R2 = 0.95 for prediction of active cases in Maharashtra, and R2 = 0.98 for prediction of recovered cases of COVID-19 in Kerala and Rajasthan, India."

        "Author": "Yu Chia Liu",
        "Abstract": "Background/purpose: Although social cognitive deficits were found in euthymic patients of bipolar disorder (BD), the characteristics of social cognition in Han Chinese euthymic BD patients remain obscure. This study aimed to examine social cognition in Han Chinese euthymic BD patients relative to healthy controls (HC). Moreover, we explore the differences in social cognition between euthymic BD I and BD II patients. Methods: 43 Han Chinese BD patients (BD-I:25, BD-II:18) and 28 HC were recruited. All patients were euthymic (Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) ≤ 7 and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) ≤ 7). Social cognitive ability was measured using Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), including 4 branches: perceiving emotions, facilitating emotions, understanding emotions, and managing emotions. Continuous performance Test (CPT) and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) were used to examine attention and executive function. Results: Significant difference in understanding emotions branch of MSCEIT was found between BD patients and HCs (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.005). Besides, BD patients had significantly worse performance in WCST and CPT. However, the differences in WCST, CPT, MSCEIT total scores and its subscales were not significant between BD I and BD II patients. Conclusion: Euthymic Han Chinese BD patients exhibit significant social cognitive deficits in understanding emotion and cognitive dysfunction in attention and executive function. Furthermore, Han Chinese BD I patients showed similar social cognitive and general cognitive ability as compared with BD II patients. Social cognitive rehabilitation on both euthymic BD I and II patients should be considered."

        "Title": "An Argument for an Ecosystemic AI: Articulating Connections across Prehuman and Posthuman Intelligences",
        "Author": "Lucy Hg Solomon",
        "Abstract": "As an art collective Cesar & Lois develops projects that examine sociotechnical systems, attempting to challenge anthropocentric technological pathways while linking to intelligences sourced in biological circuitry. As artists we imagine new configurations for what we understand as (social, economic, technological) networks and intelligences. With this ecosystemic approach we consider the possibility of an artificial intelligence (AI) that supports well-being in a broad sense, accommodating relationships across different layers of living worlds and involving local and global communities of all kinds. This thinking is grounded in research by theorists across disciplines, including communications and media theory, microbiology, anthropology, decolonial studies, social ecology, sociology and environmental psychology. At a time when human beings and their ecosystems face grave threats due to climate change and a global pandemic, we are rethinking the basis for our AIs, and for the resulting decision-making on behalf of societies and ecosystems. Creative projects by Cesar & Lois provide alternative conceptual models for thinking across networks, reframing the artists' and potentially viewers' understanding of what motivates and shapes societies. Referencing a series of artworks and the theories that underpin them, this article envisages a sociotechnical framework that takes into account ecosystems and challenges the philosophical orientations that guide society. Degenerative Cultures is an artwork in which the artists overlap microbiological organisms, AI and human systems as a speculative restructuring of networks across human and nonhuman entities. The push for ecosystemic technologies and intelligences is linked to the expansion of community to include planetary constituents, such as nonhuman beings and environments. The artists posit that such ecosystemic networks would be capable of taking into account the planet's human societies as well as nonhuman species and their environments, broadening the concept of community well-being and shifting the technological architecture to meet the complex needs of the planet and its constituent parts. The experimental series, [ECO]nomic Revolution, layers Physarum polycephalum, or slime mold, over the mapped demographics of human cities. The species polycephalum references multi-brains, and implies a decentralized logic, which for the non-neurological microbiological network translates to the sharing of nutrients and regulated growth across a culture. Assuming a perspective based in the arts, this proposition imagines a shift from the dominant conceptions of AI as an individual intelligence and frames it as part of a network that necessarily includes ecosystems. We envision the creation of sociotechnical systems that could be modeled on networked lifeforms that have optimized themselves across millions of years, like the organism Physarum polycephalum, which occurs globally in moist environments, or like those microbial populations within and outside of human bodies, whose percussive biological processing interacts with and alters many layers of lifeforms. We argue that an environmentally responsive intelligence based on relationships across living systems potentially serves a broad community composed of diverse human populations, nonhuman beings and ecosystems."

        "Author": "Jonathan Stray",
        "Abstract": "This paper investigates incorporating community well-being metrics into the objectives of optimization algorithms and the teams that build them. It documents two cases where a large platform appears to have modified their system to this end. Facebook incorporated \"well-being\" metrics in 2017, while YouTube began integrating \"user satisfaction\" metrics around 2015. Metrics tied to community well-being outcomes could also be used in many other systems, such as a news recommendation system that tries to increase exposure to diverse views, or a product recommendation system that opstimizes for the carbon footprint of purchased products. Generalizing from these examples and incorporating insights from participatory design and AI governance leads to a proposed process for integrating community well-being into commercial AI systems: identify and involve the affected community, choose a useful metric, use this metric as a managerial performance measure and/or an algorithmic objective, and evaluate and adapt to outcomes. Important open questions include the best approach to community participation and the uncertain business effects of this process."

        "Title": "Stochastic quasi-gradient methods: variance reduction via Jacobian sketching",
        "Author": "Robert M Gower",
        "Abstract": "We develop a new family of variance reduced stochastic gradient descent methods for minimizing the average of a very large number of smooth functions. Our method-JacSketch-is motivated by novel developments in randomized numerical linear algebra, and operates by maintaining a stochastic estimate of a Jacobian matrix composed of the gradients of individual functions. In each iteration, JacSketch efficiently updates the Jacobian matrix by first obtaining a random linear measurement of the true Jacobian through (cheap) sketching, and then projecting the previous estimate onto the solution space of a linear matrix equation whose solutions are consistent with the measurement. The Jacobian estimate is then used to compute a variance-reduced unbiased estimator of the gradient. Our strategy is analogous to the way quasi-Newton methods maintain an estimate of the Hessian, and hence our method can be seen as a stochastic quasi-gradient method. Our method can also be seen as stochastic gradient descent applied to a controlled stochastic optimization reformulation of the original problem, where the control comes from the Jacobian estimates. We prove that for smooth and strongly convex functions, JacSketch converges linearly with a meaningful rate dictated by a single convergence theorem which applies to general sketches. We also provide a refined convergence theorem which applies to a smaller class of sketches, featuring a novel proof technique based on a stochastic Lyapunov function. This enables us to obtain sharper complexity results for variants of JacSketch with importance sampling. By specializing our general approach to specific sketching strategies, JacSketch reduces to the celebrated stochastic average gradient (SAGA) method, and its several existing and many new minibatch, reduced memory, and importance sampling variants. Our rate for SAGA with importance sampling is the current best-known rate for this method, resolving a conjecture by Schmidt et al. (Proceedings of the eighteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, AISTATS 2015, San Diego, California, 2015). The rates we obtain for minibatch SAGA are also superior to existing rates and are sufficiently tight as to show a decrease in total complexity as the minibatch size increases. Moreover, we obtain the first minibatch SAGA method with importance sampling."

        "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this article is to offer key recommendations based on the authors' experiences for utilizing pharmacy analytics to support moving beyond standard-of-practice operational metrics towards high impact reporting to drive day-to-day decisions for frontline leaders. Summary: There is a continuous and vast amount of data generated through all facets of a health system's daily operations, yet many data elements go unused and fail to contribute to value creation and increased performance at an organizational level. It is critical, therefore, for departments of pharmacy to identify and implement effective strategies to leverage data through robust business analytics and reporting, ensuring managers at every level are provided the information they need to support data-driven decisions and meaningful interventions in the day-to-day operations of the organization. At the authors' institution, development and growth of a dedicated Pharmacy Analytics (PA) team has been instrumental to the pharmacy department for generating value and proactively supporting a business intelligence strategy that focuses on a data-driven management culture. Key recommendations to leverage pharmacy analytics are provided within four overarching themes: building transparency, leveraging synergy, optimizing actionability, and prioritizing partnerships. Conclusion: Through creation of a data-driven management culture, the authors provide recommendations for leveraging pharmacy analytics to reduce costs and impact outcomes across a range of hospital pharmacy operations."

        "Abstract": "Purpose: The intent of this article is to evaluate a novel approach, using rapid cycle analytics and real world evidence, to optimize and improve the medication evaluation process to help the formulary decision making process, while reducing time for clinicians. Summary: The Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee within each health system is responsible for evaluating medication requests for formulary addition. Members of the pharmacy staff prepare the drug monograph or a medication use evaluation (MUE) and allocate precious clinical resources to review patient charts to assess efficacy and value. We explored a novel approach to evaluate the value of our intravenous acetaminophen (IV APAP) formulary admittance. This new methodology, called rapid cycle analytics, can assist hospitals in meeting and/or exceeding the minimum criteria of formulary maintenance as defined by the Joint Commission Standards. In this particular study, we assessed the effectiveness of IV APAP in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures. We assessed the correlation to same-stay opioid utilization, average length of inpatient stay and post anesthesia care unit (PACU) time. Conclusion: We were able to explore and improve our organization's approach in evaluating medications by partnering with an external analytics expert to help organize and normalize our data in a more robust, yet time efficient manner. Additionally, we were able to use a significantly larger external data set as a point of reference. Being able to perform this detailed analytical exercise for thousands of encounters internally and using a data warehouse of over 130 million patients as a point of reference in a short time has improved the depth of our assessment, as well as reducing valuable clinical resources allocated to MUEs to allow for more direct patient care. This clinically real-world and data-rich analytics model is the necessary foundation for using Artificial or Augmented Intelligence (AI) to make real-time formulary and drug selection decisions."

        "Abstract": "Background: The progress and innovation in telemedicine within the Middle Eastern countries have not been heavily monitored. Therefore, the present study aims to analyze the scholarly work conducted in the Arab world, using reproducible statistical and scientometric techniques. Methods: An electronic search of Web of Science (core database) had been conducted through use of an extensive search strategy comprising of keywords specific to the Arab region, EMRO countries, telehealth, medical conditions, and disorders. A total yield of 1,630 search results were processed, indexed through July 7, 2020. CiteSpace (5.7.R1, Drexel University, Pennsylvania, USA) is a Java-based application, a user-friendly tool for conducting scientometric analyses. Results: The present analyses found a lack of innovation in the field of digital health in the Arab countries. Many gaps in research were found in Arab countries, which will be discussed subsequently. Digital health research was clustered around themes of big data and artificial intelligence; a lack of progress was seen in telemedicine and digital health. Furthermore, only a small proportion of these publications had principal or corresponding authors from Arab countries. A clear disparity in digital health research in the Arab world was evident after comparing these insights with our previous investigation on telemedicine research in the global context. Conclusion: Telemedicine research is still in its infancy in the Middle Eastern countries. Recommendations include diversification of the research landscape and interdisciplinary collaborations in this area."

        "Abstract": "Chronic pelvic pain affects one in seven women worldwide, and there is an urgent need to reduce its associated significant costs and to improve women's health. There are many correlated factors associated with chronic pelvic pain (CPP), and analyzing them simultaneously can be complex and involves many challenges. A newly developed interaction ensemble, referred to as INTENSE, was implemented to investigate this research gap. When applied, INTENSE aggregates three machine learning (ML) methods, which are unsupervised, as follows: interaction principal component analysis (IPCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and centroid-based clustering (CBC). For our proposed research, we used INTENSE to uncover novel knowledge, which revealed new interactions in a sample of 656 patients among 25 factors: age, parity, ethnicity, body mass index, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, painful bladder syndrome, pelvic floor tenderness, abdominal wall pain, depression score, anxiety score, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, family history of chronic pain, new or re-referral, age when first experienced pain, pain duration, surgery helpful for pain, infertility, smoking, alcohol use, trauma, dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, CPP, and the Endometriosis Health Profile for functional quality of life. INTENSE indicates that CPP and the Endometriosis Health Profile are correlated with depression score, anxiety score, and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. Other insights derived from these ML methods include the finding that higher body mass index was clustered with smoking and a history of life trauma. As well, sexual pain (deep dyspareunia) was found to be associated with musculoskeletal pain contributors (abdominal wall pain and pelvic floor tenderness). Therefore, INTENSE provided expert-like reasoning without training any model or prior knowledge of CPP. ML has the potential to identify novel relationships in the etiology of CPP, and thus can drive innovative future research."

        "Abstract": "Introduction: Electrocardiography (ECG) is a quick and easily accessible method for diagnosis and screening of cardiovascular diseases including heart failure (HF). Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for semi-automated ECG analysis. The aim of this evaluation was to provide an overview of AI use in HF detection from ECG signals and to perform a meta-analysis of available studies. Methods and Results: An independent comprehensive search of the PubMed and Google Scholar database was conducted for articles dealing with the ability of AI to predict HF based on ECG signals. Only original articles published in peer-reviewed journals were considered. A total of five reports including 57,027 patients and 579,134 ECG datasets were identified including two sets of patient-level data and three with ECG-based datasets. The AI-processed ECG data yielded areas under the receiver operator characteristics curves between 0.92 and 0.99 to identify HF with higher values in ECG-based datasets. Applying a random-effects model, an sROC of 0.987 was calculated. Using the contingency tables led to diagnostic odds ratios ranging from 3.44 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.12-3.76] to 13.61 (95% CI = 13.14-14.08) also with lower values in patient-level datasets. The meta-analysis diagnostic odds ratio was 7.59 (95% CI = 5.85-9.34). Conclusions: The present meta-analysis confirms the ability of AI to predict HF from standard 12-lead ECG signals underlining the potential of such an approach. The observed overestimation of the diagnostic ability in artificial ECG databases compared to patient-level data stipulate the need for robust prospective studies."

        "Author": "Yuanzhao Zhang",
        "Abstract": "Background: AI-driven digital health tools often rely on estimates of disease incidence or prevalence, but obtaining these estimates is costly and time-consuming. We explored the use of machine learning models that leverage contextual information about diseases from unstructured text, to estimate disease incidence. Methods: We used a class of machine learning models, called language models, to extract contextual information relating to disease incidence. We evaluated three different language models: BioBERT, Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe), and the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), as well as an approach which uses all jointly. The output of these models is a mathematical representation of the underlying data, known as \"embeddings.\" We used these to train neural network models to predict disease incidence. The neural networks were trained and validated using data from the Global Burden of Disease study, and tested using independent data sourced from the epidemiological literature. Findings: A variety of language models can be used to encode contextual information of diseases. We found that, on average, BioBERT embeddings were the best for disease names across multiple tasks. In particular, BioBERT was the best performing model when predicting specific disease-country pairs, whilst a fusion model combining BioBERT, GloVe, and USE performed best on average when predicting disease incidence in unseen countries. We also found that GloVe embeddings performed better than BioBERT embeddings when applied to country names. However, we also noticed that the models were limited in view of predicting previously unseen diseases. Further limitations were also observed with substantial variations across age groups and notably lower performance for diseases that are highly dependent on location and climate. Interpretation: We demonstrate that context-aware machine learning models can be used for estimating disease incidence. This method is quicker to implement than traditional epidemiological approaches. We therefore suggest it complements existing modeling efforts, where data is required more rapidly or at larger scale. This may particularly benefit AI-driven digital health products where the data will undergo further processing and a validated approximation of the disease incidence is adequate."

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) digital health systems have drawn much attention over the last decade. However, their implementation into medical practice occurs at a much slower pace than expected. This paper reviews some of the achievements of first-generation AI systems, and the barriers facing their implementation into medical practice. The development of second-generation AI systems is discussed with a focus on overcoming some of these obstacles. Second-generation systems are aimed at focusing on a single subject and on improving patients' clinical outcomes. A personalized closed-loop system designed to improve end-organ function and the patient's response to chronic therapies is presented. The system introduces a platform which implements a personalized therapeutic regimen and introduces quantifiable individualized-variability patterns into its algorithm. The platform is designed to achieve a clinically meaningful endpoint by ensuring that chronic therapies will have sustainable effect while overcoming compensatory mechanisms associated with disease progression and drug resistance. Second-generation systems are expected to assist patients and providers in adopting and implementing of these systems into everyday care."

        "Abstract": "This commentary article focuses on the emergence of synthetic media-computer-generated content that is created by employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. It discusses three of the most notable current forms of this emerging form of content: deepfakes, virtual influencers, and augmented and virtual reality (collectively known as extended reality). Their key features are introduced, and the main challenges and opportunities associated with the technologies are analysed. In all cases, a crucial change is underway: reality (or, at least, the perception thereof) is seen as increasingly less stable, and potential for manipulation is on the rise. In fact, it transpires that personalisation of (perceived) reality is the likely outcome, with increasing societal fragmentation as a result. Mediatisation is used as a broad-ranging metatheory that explains the permeation by media of everyday affairs to explain the degree of impact that synthetic media have on the society. In this context, it is suggested that we search for new and alternative criteria for reality that would be capable of accounting for the changing nature of agency and impact in today's world."

Drawing on a decidedly public administration perspective, and given the current challenges that have thus far become manifest in the field, we critically reflect on and map out in a conceptually guided manner the implications of these systems, and the limitations they pose, for public accountability."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI has played an essential role in identifying suspected infections, ensuring epidemic surveillance and quickening drug screening. However, many questions accompanied AI's development. How to protect citizens' privacy and national information security? What measures can help AI learn and practice good human behaviors and avoid unethical use of AI technologies? To answer these questions, Nation Science Review (NSR) interviewed Yi Zeng, Professor and Deputy Director at the Research Center for Brain-inspired Artificial Intelligence at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). He is a board member for the National Governance Committee of Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence affiliated to the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (MOST). Zeng is also in AI ethics expert groups at the World Health Organization and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). He jointly led the drafting of Beijing AI Principles (2019) and the National Governance Principles of New Generation AI of China (GPNGAI, 2019)."

        "Abstract": "The use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods in hematology includes diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic applications. This increase is due to the improved access to ML and DL tools and the expansion of medical data. The utilization of ML remains limited in clinical practice, with some disciplines further along in their adoption, such as radiology and histopathology. In this review, we discuss the current uses of ML in diagnosis in the field of hematology, including image-recognition, laboratory, and genomics-based diagnosis. Additionally, we provide an introduction to the fields of ML and DL, highlighting current trends, limitations, and possible areas of improvement."

        "Title": "Wearable multi-sensing double-chain thermoelectric generator",
        "Author": "Dan-Liang Wen",
        "Abstract": "Wearable electronics play a crucial role in advancing the rapid development of artificial intelligence, and as an attractive future vision, all-in-one wearable microsystems integrating powering, sensing, actuating and other functional components on a single chip have become an appealing tendency. Herein, we propose a wearable thermoelectric generator (ThEG) with a novel double-chain configuration to simultaneously realize sustainable energy harvesting and multi-functional sensing. In contrast to traditional single-chain ThEGs with the sole function of thermal energy harvesting, each individual chain of the developed double-chain thermoelectric generator (DC-ThEG) can be utilized to scavenge heat energy, and moreover, the combination of the two chains can be employed as functional sensing electrodes at the same time. The mature mass-fabrication technology of screen printing was successfully introduced to print n-type and p-type thermoelectric inks atop a polymeric substrate to form thermocouples to construct two independent chains, which makes this DC-ThEG flexible, high-performance and cost-efficient. The emerging material of silk fibroin was employed to cover the gap of the fabricated two chains to serve as a functional layer for sensing the existence of liquid water molecules in the air and the temperature. The powering and sensing functions of the developed DC-ThEG and their interactions were systematically studied via experimental measurements, which proved the DC-ThEG to be a robust multi-functional power source with a 151 mV open-circuit voltage. In addition, it was successfully demonstrated that this DC-ThEG can convert heat energy to achieve a 3.3 V output, matching common power demands of wearable electronics, and harvest biothermal energy to drive commercial electronics (i.e., a calculator). The integration approach of powering and multi-functional sensing based on this new double-chain configuration might open a new chapter in advanced thermoelectric generators, especially in the applications of all-in-one self-powered microsystems."

        "Abstract": "Research on the exposome has been extended to personal exposures, and full assessment of personal exposures is of great significance for personal health monitoring and epidemiological studies. Compared with static measurement instruments, wearable sensors are more suitable for dynamic personal exposures assessment. The development of flexible wearable sensors with the features of being physically comfortable and easy to use can be a promising solution for the measurement of personal exposures. With the support of big data and AI, large-scale personal exposures assessment could foster the transition from population-based to individual-based epidemiological studies and upgrade the intelligence level of medical services."

        "Author": "Maite Garaigordobil",
        "Abstract": "This study explores Intrapersonal Emotional Intelligence (IEI) with the objectives of: (1) analyzing possible differences due to sex and age, and the request for psychological assistance for behavioral and emotional problems; (2) finding evidence of personality traits, social behaviors, and parental socialization styles that are characteristic of adolescents with low IEI; and (3) identifying variables that predict high IEI. The sample comprised 2283 participants aged 12-17 years from the Basque Country (northern Spain). Results: (1) Females had greater emotional attention capacity but there were no sex differences in emotional comprehension and emotion regulation; (2) adolescents aged 12-14 showed higher scores in comprehension and emotion regulation than those aged 15-17; (3) adolescents who consulted a psychologist for problems (anxiety, depression, violence, etc.) had lower emotion regulation; (4) adolescents with low IEI had less empathy, self-esteem, extroversion, openness, agreeableness, and responsibility, and lower use of cooperative and passive conflict-resolution strategies, and their parents had a low level of acceptance-affection towards their children. They also engaged in more bullying/cyberbullying and antisocial behaviors. (5) High IEI predictor variables were: using cooperative conflict-resolution strategies; traits such as extroversion, responsibility, openness, and empathy; and a high level of maternal acceptance-affection. The work identifies relevant variables for designing intervention programs and shows the importance of promoting IEI and interpersonal emotional intelligence as a factor in the development and prevention of bullying/cyberbullying."

        "Author": "Jose Luis Antoñanzas",
        "Abstract": "An analysis of secondary students' personality traits, along with a description of their emotional intelligence levels and their anger control, could be decisive when educating students to prevent anti-social behavior in academia. Very few studies on personality, emotional intelligence, and aggressive conduct exist in Spain. Some of the studies that do exist, however, only explore the relationship between emotional intelligence, personality, and prosocial behavior in secondary education students. Likewise, there are few studies focusing on personality and aggression control. In this study, using the Big Five personality models as predictors of aggressiveness in subjects and of emotional intelligence, we sought to contribute to the improvement of the education of students on aggressive behavior in education centers. To do this, we conducted a study using the Big Five Personality Questionnaire (BFQ) for Children and Adults (BFQ-NA), the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24) emotional intelligence test, and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) anger management test. Our main objective was to analyze the relationship of the BFQ with the variables of emotional intelligence and aggressiveness. This was achieved using a range of bivariate correlation and multiple regression tests. The results showed the correlation and predictive value of emotional intelligence and aggression in the Big Five model of personality. This study coincides with other research linking Big Five questionnaires with emotional intelligence and aggression."

        "Author": "Sheila Glenn",
        "Abstract": "Accurate assessment of pain by health-care professionals is essential to ensure optimal management of pain. An under-researched area is whether personality characteristics affect perception of pain in others. The aims were (a) to determine whether individual differences are associated with participants' ability to assess pain, and (b) to determine facial cues used in the assessment of pain. One hundred and twenty-eight undergraduate students participated. They completed questionnaire assessments of empathy, pain catastrophizing, sensory sensitivity and emotional intelligence. They then viewed and rated four adult facial images (no, medium, and high pain-12 images total) using a 0-10 numerical rating scale, and noted the reasons for their ratings. (a) Empathy was the only characteristic associated with accuracy of pain assessment. (b) Descriptions of eyes and mouth, and eyes alone were most commonly associated with assessment accuracy. This was the case despite variations in the expression of pain in the four faces. Future studies could evaluate the effect on accuracy of pain assessment of (a) training empathic skills for pain assessment, and (b) emphasizing attention to the eyes, and eyes and mouth."

        "Abstract": "The healthcare sector is considered to be one of the largest and fast-growing industries in the world. Innovations and novel approaches have always remained the prime aims in order to bring massive development. Before the emergence of technology, the healthcare sector was dependent on manpower, which was time-consuming and less accurate with lack of efficiency. With the recent advancements in machine learning, the condition has been steadily revolutionizing. Artificial intelligence (AI) lies in the computer science department, which stresses on the intelligent machines' creation, that work and react just like human beings. Currently, the applications of AI have been expanding into those fields, which was once thought to be the only domain of human expertise such as healthcare sector. In this review, we have shed light on the present usage of AI in the healthcare sector, such as its working, and the way this system is being implemented in different domains, such as drug discovery, diagnosis of diseases, clinical trials, remote patient monitoring, and nanotechnology. We have also briefly touched upon its applications in other sectors as well. The public opinions have also been analyzed and discussed along with the future prospects. We have discussed the merits, and the other side of AI, i.e. the disadvantages in the last part of the manuscript."

        "Abstract": "Biological neuronal cells communicate using neurochemistry and electrical signals. The same phenomena also allow us to probe and manipulate neuronal systems and communicate with them. Neuronal system malfunctions cause a multitude of symptoms and functional deficiencies that can be assessed and sometimes alleviated by electrical stimulation. Our working hypothesis is that real-time closed-loop full-duplex measurement and stimulation paradigms can provide more in-depth insight into neuronal networks and enhance our capability to control diseases of the nervous system. In this study, we review extracellular electrical stimulation methods used in in vivo, in vitro, and in silico neuroscience research and in the clinic (excluding methods mainly aimed at neuronal growth and other similar effects) and highlight the potential of closed-loop measurement and stimulation systems. A multitude of electrical stimulation and measurement-based methods are widely used in research and the clinic. Closed-loop methods have been proposed, and some are used in the clinic. However, closed-loop systems utilizing more complex measurement analysis and adaptive stimulation systems, such as artificial intelligence systems connected to biological neuronal systems, do not yet exist. Our review promotes the research and development of intelligent paradigms aimed at meaningful communications between neuronal and information and communications technology systems, \"dialogical paradigms,\" which have the potential to take neuroscience and clinical methods to a new level."

        "Author": "Zahra Khorrami",
        "Abstract": "Objectives: Liveability is a multi-dimensional and hierarchical concept which consists of various criteria and sub-criteria and may be evaluated in different ways. The aim of this study was to systematically review indicators and methods used for the evaluation of urban liveability in literature. Content: The five-stage methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley was used to conduct this scoping review. A systematic search of electronic databases, including Scopus, Medline (via PubMed), Embase, Web of Science and EBSCO was done until May 29, 2019. Web searching, searching reference lists and hand searching was also conducted to retrieve more relevant articles. Two reviewers screened the papers for eligibility based on the inclusion criteria and extracted their key data and reported them descriptively. Summary: Sixty seven (67) out of 3,599 papers met the selection criteria. This review showed five distinct domains considered to be important components of liveability. These were Economical, Environmental, Institutional, Social, and Governance (Political) domains. The most important subdomains (indices) which were frequently applied in various studies were Environmental friendliness and Sustainability, Socio-Cultural Conditions and Economic Vibrancy and Competitiveness. We also identified seven different methodologies and six ranking tools used for assessing urban liveability. Among the quantitative methods, three methods accounted for 89.6% of the articles. These methods were the Analytical hierarchy process and entropy (AHP; n=24; 50%), Factor analysis & Principle Component Analysis (FA & PCA; n=12; 25%) and Spatial Multi-criteria Decision-making Method (Spatial; n=7; 14.6%). Among the ranking tools used, three ranking tools accounted for 65.4% of the articles. These tools were the Livable City Scientific Evaluation Standards (LCSES; n=9; 34.6%), The Global Liveable Cities Index (GLCI; n=4; 15.4%) and the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU; n=4; 15.4%). Outlook: This paper discusses and summarizes the latest indicators and methods used for determining urban liveability. The information offered in the review can help future investigators to decide which method suits their purpose and situation better and measure urban liveability more systematically than before."

In this work we propose a multi-head Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture trained to infer an estimation of passenger attendance in a metro car. The proposed network architecture consists of two main parts: a convolutional backbone, which extracts features over the whole input image, and a multi-head layers able to estimate a density map, needed to predict the number of people within the crowd image. The network performance is first evaluated on publicly available crowd counting datasets, including the ShanghaiTech part_A, ShanghaiTech part_B and UCF_CC_50, and then trained and tested on our dataset acquired in subway cars in Italy. In both cases a comparison is made against the most relevant and latest state of the art crowd counting architectures, showing that our proposed MH-MetroNet architecture outperforms in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Square Error (MSE) and passenger-crowd people number prediction."

        "Abstract": "With the exponential increase in new cases coupled with an increased mortality rate, cancer has ranked as the second most prevalent cause of death in the world. Early detection is paramount for suitable diagnosis and effective treatment of different kinds of cancers, but this is limited to the accuracy and sensitivity of available diagnostic imaging methods. Breast cancer is the most widely diagnosed cancer among women across the globe with a high percentage of total cancer deaths requiring an intensive, accurate, and sensitive imaging approach. Indeed, it is treatable when detected at an early stage. Hence, the use of state of the art computational approaches has been proposed as a potential alternative approach for the design and development of novel diagnostic imaging methods for breast cancer. Thus, this review provides a concise overview of past and present conventional diagnostics approaches in breast cancer detection. Further, we gave an account of several computational models (machine learning, deep learning, and robotics), which have been developed and can serve as alternative techniques for breast cancer diagnostics imaging. This review will be helpful to academia, medical practitioners, and others for further study in this area to improve the biomedical breast cancer imaging diagnosis."

        "Abstract": "Vulnerable Road User (VRU) detection is a major application of object detection with the aim of helping reduce accidents in advanced driver-assistance systems and enabling the development of autonomous vehicles. Due to intrinsic complexity present in computer vision and to limitations in processing capacity and bandwidth, this task has not been completely solved nowadays. For these reasons, the well established YOLOv3 net and the new YOLOv4 one are assessed by training them on a huge, recent on-road image dataset (BDD100K), both for VRU and full on-road classes, with a great improvement in terms of detection quality when compared to their MS-COCO-trained generic correspondent models from the authors but with negligible costs in forward pass time. Additionally, some models were retrained when replacing the original Leaky ReLU convolutional activation functions from original YOLO implementation with two cutting-edge activation functions: the self-regularized non-monotonic function (MISH) and its self-gated counterpart (SWISH), with significant improvements with respect to the original activation function detection performance. Additionally, some trials were carried out including recent data augmentation techniques (mosaic and cutmix) and some grid size configurations, with cumulative improvements over the previous results, comprising different performance-throughput trade-offs."

SELECT students were surveyed annually. The survey contained the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). In this cohort, empathy did not decrease, as measured by the JSE, and SELECT students' MBI Depersonalization burnout scores decreased after year 3. In summary, in this allopathic US medical school utilizing a novel curriculum, there was no significant decline in empathy after the third year of medical school. The SELECT program appears to mitigate the decline in empathy and increased Depersonalization burnout levels often seen at the end of the third year of medical school."

        "Abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to transform the health system, yet little research to date has explored its influence on nurses-the largest group of health professionals. Furthermore, there has been little discussion on how AI will influence the experience of person-centered compassionate care for patients, families, and caregivers. Objective: This review aims to summarize the extant literature on the emerging trends in health technologies powered by AI and their implications on the following domains of nursing: administration, clinical practice, policy, and research. This review summarizes the findings from 3 research questions, examining how these emerging trends might influence the roles and functions of nurses and compassionate nursing care over the next 10 years and beyond. Methods: Using an established scoping review methodology, MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central, Education Resources Information Center, Scopus, Web of Science, and ProQuest databases were searched. In addition to the electronic database searches, a targeted website search was performed to access relevant gray literature. Abstracts and full-text studies were independently screened by 2 reviewers using prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Included articles focused on nursing and digital health technologies that incorporate AI. Data were charted using structured forms and narratively summarized. Results: A total of 131 articles were retrieved from the scoping review for the 3 research questions that were the focus of this manuscript (118 from database sources and 13 from targeted websites). Emerging AI technologies discussed in the review included predictive analytics, smart homes, virtual health care assistants, and robots. The results indicated that AI has already begun to influence nursing roles, workflows, and the nurse-patient relationship. In general, robots are not viewed as replacements for nurses. There is a consensus that health technologies powered by AI may have the potential to enhance nursing practice. Consequently, nurses must proactively define how person-centered compassionate care will be preserved in the age of AI. Conclusions: Nurses have a shared responsibility to influence decisions related to the integration of AI into the health system and to ensure that this change is introduced in a way that is ethical and aligns with core nursing values such as compassionate care. Furthermore, nurses must advocate for patient and nursing involvement in all aspects of the design, implementation, and evaluation of these technologies.

        "Abstract": "Background: Published literature shows the overall challenges associated with artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled medicine and telepsychiatry more from the western perspective, with no specific mention from the perspective of individual stakeholders or Indians. This study was conceptualized to understand the perceived challenges of building, deploying, and using AI-enabled telepsychiatry for clinical practice from the perspectives of psychiatrist, patients, and the technology experts (who build such services) in urban India. Methods: Between February 2020 and April 2020, a semistructured topic guide was drafted for qualitative exploratory study among psychiatrists (n = 14), their patients (n = 14), technology experts (n = 13), and Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) (n = 5) of health technology incubation centers. Interviews were conducted over the phone, recorded, and analyzed using the grounded theory approach. Results: Almost all respondents cited ethical, legal, accountability, and regulatory implications as challenges. The major issues stated by patients were privacy/confidentiality, ethical violations, security/ hacking, and data ownership. Psychiatrists cited lack of clinical validation, lack of established studies or trials, iatrogenic risk, and healthcare infrastructure issues as the main challenges. Technology experts stated data-related issues as the major challenge. The CEOs quoted the lack of interdisciplinary experts as one of the main challenges in building deployable AI-enabled telepsychiatry in India. Conclusions: There are challenges to deploy an AI-enabled telepsychiatry platform in India. There is a need to constitute an interdisciplinary team to systematically address these challenges. Deployment of AI-enabled telepsychiatry is not possible without clinical validation and addressing current challenges."

We explore the relationship between sensory processing and school performance in 26 high-functioning youths with ASD and 26 controls (age 8-14) using measures of sensory, social, cognitive, and academic functioning. In the ASD group, bivariate Pearson correlations indicated a significant positive relationship between intelligence quotient (IQ) and the School Competence Scale (SCS) of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and a significant negative relationship between Dunn's Sensory Processing Framework and SCS scores. Final hierarchical multiple linear regression model accounting for SCS scores in ASD included IQ, ADHD symptoms, and sensory features. An interaction between increased sensory sensitivity with reduced sensory avoidance behaviors explained the greatest amount of variance in SCS, meaning school performance is lowest for children with greater hypersensitivity and fewer avoidance behaviors. Results indicate a strong impact of sensory processing on school performance in ASD."

        "Abstract": "Introduction: Previous studies have found that patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) showed impairments in certain aspects of spatial orientation. The current study aimed to systematically investigate whether these impairments extend to wayfinding abilities in patients with PD. Wayfinding refers to the ability to navigate to an unseen location in the environment and is essential to one's everyday functioning. Methods: A total of 24 patients with PD, 20 ability matched controls, 21 college students participated in a series of experimental behavioral tasks and a self-report of environmental abilities. In the route learning task, participants learned and then recalled routes. In the survey learning task, participants were asked to form configurational or survey knowledge. In the map tracing tack, participants were asked to trace the turning directions of a route on a map. Results: Patients with PD showed no impairments in the behavioral measures of wayfinding relative to ability matched controls. Both groups performed worse than college students, who had higher cognitive levels. Patients with PD, however, reported a higher competency in environmental abilities than college students. Conclusion: Although wayfinding abilities may decrease as cognitive abilities decline, they do not appear as a unique impairment for patients with PD relative to their cognitive level."

        "Author": "Elise B Barbeau",
        "Abstract": "Speech onset delays (SOD) and language atypicalities are central aspects of the autism spectrum (AS), despite not being included in the categorical diagnosis of AS. Previous studies separating participants according to speech onset history have shown distinct patterns of brain organization and activation in perceptual tasks. One major white matter tract, the arcuate fasciculus (AF), connects the posterior temporal and left frontal language regions. Here, we used anatomical brain imaging to investigate the properties of the AF in adolescent and adult autistic individuals with typical levels of intelligence who differed by age of speech onset. The left AF of the AS group showed a significantly smaller volume than that of the nonautistic group. Such a reduction in volume was only present in the younger group. This result was driven by the autistic group without SOD (SOD-), despite their typical age of speech onset. The autistic group with SOD (SOD+) showed a more typical AF as adults relative to matched controls. This suggests that, along with multiple studies in AS-SOD+ individuals, atypical brain reorganization is observable in the 2 major AS subgroups and that such reorganization applies mostly to the language regions in SOD- and perceptual regions in SOD+ individuals."

        "Author": "Kelsey Buckley",
        "Abstract": "Objective. To determine student pharmacists' perceptions of a leadership development program for student organization officers and report the changes in their Emotional Intelligence Appraisal (EIA) scores.Methods. Between 2015-2018, three different cohorts of Doctor of Pharmacy students participated in a voluntary leadership development program that spanned six academic quarters. The program included a variety of self-assessments and large-group topic discussions, followed by quarterly individual written reflections with feedback from faculty mentors. These activities primarily addressed the topics of emotional intelligence, strengths-based leadership, and continuous leadership development. Participants' EIA scores near the beginning and end of the program were compared. An anonymous online survey of participant perceptions was administered at the end of the program.Results. One hundred sixty-six student pharmacists completed all program activities. Each cohort's final mean overall, self-awareness, self-management, and social awareness EIA scores were higher than their corresponding mean initial scores. The overall response rate for the online survey was 61%. All respondents either strongly agreed or agreed that participating in the program enhanced their leadership skills. The majority of respondents additionally rated each of the program's activities as being either beneficial or very beneficial. The emotional intelligence assessment and strengths-based leadership assessment were the activities that were most frequently cited as being very beneficial.Conclusion. The pilot implementation of this leadership development program appears to have been both impactful and well received. Programs structured like this one may provide an effective way of increasing the emotional intelligence of student pharmacists, particularly within accelerated pharmacy programs."

        "Title": "Supporting global antimicrobial stewardship: antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of surgical site infection in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs): a scoping review and meta-analysis",
        "Author": "Lesley Cooper",
        "Abstract": "Background: The Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group is supporting two hospitals in Ghana to develop antimicrobial stewardship. Early intelligence gathering suggested that surgical prophylaxis was suboptimal. We reviewed the evidence for use of surgical prophylaxis to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to inform this work. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL and Google Scholar were searched from inception to 17 February 2020 for trials, audits, guidelines and systematic reviews in English. Grey literature, websites and reference lists of included studies were searched. Randomized clinical trials reporting incidence of SSI following Caesarean section were included in two meta-analyses. Narrative analysis of studies that explored behaviours and attitudes was conducted. Results: This review included 51 studies related to SSI and timing of antibiotic prophylaxis in LMICs. Incidence of SSI is higher in LMICs, infection surveillance data are poor and there is a lack of local guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis. Education to improve appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with reduction of SSI in LMICs. The random-effects pooled mean risk ratio of SSI in Caesarean section was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.51-1.17) for pre-incision versus post-incision prophylaxis and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.55-1.14) for short versus long duration. Reduction in cost and nurse time was reported in shorter-duration surgical antibiotic prophylaxis. Conclusions: There is scope for improvement, but interventions must include local context and address strongly held beliefs. Establishment of local multidisciplinary teams will promote ownership and sustainability of change."

        "Author": "David C Geary",
        "Abstract": "Identifying meaningful cognitive and non-cognitive predictors of mathematical competence is critical for developing targeted interventions for students struggling with mathematics. Here, 317 students' short-term verbal memory, verbal and visuospatial working memory, complex spatial abilities, intelligence, and mathematics attitudes and anxiety were assessed, and their teachers reported on their attentive-behavior in seventh-grade mathematics classrooms. Bayesian regression models revealed that complex spatial abilities and in-class attention were the most plausible predictors of seventh-grade mathematics, but not word reading, achievement, controlling for prior achievement. These results were confirmed with multilevel models that revealed interactions between these factors and prior achievement. The largest gains were among students with strong mathematical competencies in sixth-grade, and average or better in-class attention in seventh-grade as well as above average spatial abilities. High mathematics anxiety was associated with lower attention and through this indirectly influenced achievement gains. These results have implications for how to best target interventions for students at risk for long-term difficulties with mathematics."

        "Author": "Justinas Miseikis",
        "Abstract": "Lio is a mobile robot platform with a multi-functional arm explicitly designed for human-robot interaction and personal care assistant tasks. The robot has already been deployed in several health care facilities, where it is functioning autonomously, assisting staff and patients on an everyday basis. Lio is intrinsically safe by having full coverage in soft artificial-leather material as well as collision detection, limited speed and forces. Furthermore, the robot has a compliant motion controller. A combination of visual, audio, laser, ultrasound and mechanical sensors are used for safe navigation and environment understanding. The ROS-enabled setup allows researchers to access raw sensor data as well as have direct control of the robot. The friendly appearance of Lio has resulted in the robot being well accepted by health care staff and patients. Fully autonomous operation is made possible by a flexible decision engine, autonomous navigation and automatic recharging. Combined with time-scheduled task triggers, this allows Lio to operate throughout the day, with a battery life of up to 8 hours and recharging during idle times. A combination of powerful computing units provides enough processing power to deploy artificial intelligence and deep learning-based solutions on-board the robot without the need to send any sensitive data to cloud services, guaranteeing compliance with privacy requirements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lio was rapidly adjusted to perform additional functionality like disinfection and remote elevated body temperature detection. It complies with ISO13482 - Safety requirements for personal care robots, meaning it can be directly tested and deployed in care facilities."

        "Author": "Mohamed Abd Elaziz",
        "Abstract": "Medical imaging techniques play a critical role in diagnosing diseases and patient healthcare. They help in treatment, diagnosis, and early detection. Image segmentation is one of the most important steps in processing medical images, and it has been widely used in many applications. Multi-level thresholding (MLT) is considered as one of the simplest and most effective image segmentation techniques. Traditional approaches apply histogram methods; however, these methods face some challenges. In recent years, swarm intelligence methods have been leveraged in MLT, which is considered an NP-hard problem. One of the main drawbacks of the SI methods is when searching for optimum solutions, and some may get stuck in local optima. This because during the run of SI methods, they create random sequences among different operators. In this study, we propose a hybrid SI based approach that combines the features of two SI methods, marine predators algorithm (MPA) and moth-?ame optimization (MFO). The proposed approach is called MPAMFO, in which, the MFO is utilized as a local search method for MPA to avoid trapping at local optima. The MPAMFO is proposed as an MLT approach for image segmentation, which showed excellent performance in all experiments. To test the performance of MPAMFO, two experiments were carried out. The first one is to segment ten natural gray-scale images. The second experiment tested the MPAMFO for a real-world application, such as CT images of COVID-19. Therefore, thirteen CT images were used to test the performance of MPAMFO. Furthermore, extensive comparisons with several SI methods have been implemented to examine the quality and the performance of the MPAMFO. Overall experimental results confirm that the MPAMFO is an efficient MLT approach that approved its superiority over other existing methods."

        "Abstract": "Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) is emerging as an advance terminology for monitoring and controlling the underwater aquatic life. This technology determines the undiscovered resources present in the water through computational intelligence (CI) techniques. CI here pertains to the capability of a system to acquire a specific task from data or experimental surveillance below the water. In today's time data is considered as the identity for everything that exists in nature, whether that data is related to human beings, machines or any type of device like internet of underwater things (IoUT). The collected data should be correct, complete and fulfill the requirements of a particular task to be done. Underwater data collection is very tough because of sensors mobility due to water drift 3 meters/sec, crest and trough. A lot of packet drop also exists due to underwater conditions that hurdles the data collection process. Various techniques already exists for efficient collection of data below the water but these are not properly classified. This manuscript has summarized the concept of data collection in UWSN along with its classification based on routing. Also, a short discussion about existence of CORONA below the water along with water purification is carried out. Furthermore, some data routing approaches are also analyzed on the basis of quality of service parameters and the current challenges to be tackled during data collection are also discussed."

        "Title": "Envisioning Insight-Driven Learning Based on Thick Data Analytics With Focus on Healthcare",
        "Author": "Jinan Fiaidhi",
        "Abstract": "Detecting and analyzing patient insights from social media enables healthcare givers to better understand what patients want and also to identify their pain points. Healthcare institutions cannot neglect the need to monitor and analyze popular social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook. To have a study success, a healthcare giver needs to be able to engage with their patients and adapt to their preferences effectively. However, data-driven decision-making is no longer enough, as the best-in-class organizations struggle to realize tangible benefits from their data-driven analytics investments. Relying on simplistic textual analytics that use big data technologies to learn consumer/patient insights is no longer sufficient as most of these analytics utilize sort of bag-of-words counting algorithms. The majority of projects utilizing big data analytics have failed due to the obsession with metrics at the expense of capturing the customer's perspective data, as well as the failure in turning consumer insights into actions. Most of the consumer insights can be captured with qualitative research methods that work with small, even statistically insignificant, sample sizes. Employing qualitative analytics provide some kind of actionable intelligence which acquires understanding to broad questions about the consumer needs in tandem with analytical power. Generating insight, on one hand, requires sound techniques to measure consumers' engagement more precisely and offers depth analytics to the consumer data story. On the other hand, turning relevant insights into actions requires incorporating actionable intelligence across the business by verify hypotheses based on qualitative findings by using web analytics to see if these axioms apply to a large number of customers. The first component of our visionary approach is dedicated to identifying the relationships between constituents of the healthcare pain points as echoed by the social media conversation in terms of sociographic network where the elements composing these conversations are described as nodes and their interactions as links. In this part, conversation groups of nodes that are heavily connected will be identified representing what we call conversation communities. By identifying these conversation communities several consumer hidden insights can be inferred from using techniques such as visualizing conversation graphs relevant to given pain point, conversation learning from question answering, conversations summaries, conversation timelines, conversation anomalies and other conversation pattern learning techniques. These techniques will identify and learn the patient insights without forgetting from the context of conversation communities, are tagged as \"thick data analytics\". Additionally machine learning methods can be used as assistive techniques to learn from the identified thick data and build models around identified thick data. With the use of transfer learning we also can fine tune these models with the arrival of new conversations. The author is currently experimenting with these seven insights driven learning methods described in this paper with massive geo-located Twitter data to infer the quality of care related to the current COVID-19 outbreak."

        "Author": "Mohammad Behdad Jamshidi",
        "Abstract": "COVID-19 outbreak has put the whole world in an unprecedented difficult situation bringing life around the world to a frightening halt and claiming thousands of lives. Due to COVID-19's spread in 212 countries and territories and increasing numbers of infected cases and death tolls mounting to 5,212,172 and 334,915 (as of May 22 2020), it remains a real threat to the public health system. This paper renders a response to combat the virus through Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some Deep Learning (DL) methods have been illustrated to reach this goal, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and Long/Short Term Memory (LSTM). It delineates an integrated bioinformatics approach in which different aspects of information from a continuum of structured and unstructured data sources are put together to form the user-friendly platforms for physicians and researchers. The main advantage of these AI-based platforms is to accelerate the process of diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 disease. The most recent related publications and medical reports were investigated with the purpose of choosing inputs and targets of the network that could facilitate reaching a reliable Artificial Neural Network-based tool for challenges associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, there are some specific inputs for each platform, including various forms of the data, such as clinical data and medical imaging which can improve the performance of the introduced approaches toward the best responses in practical applications."

        "Author": "J J Sylvia 4th",
        "Abstract": "As COVID-19 spreads across the globe, new technologies are being leveraged to enforce social distancing requirements. I explore social distancing through the theoretical lens of Michel Foucault's biopolitics, with an emphasis on recognizing unauthorized movement and controlling circulation. Although reporting and widely shared data visualizations about COVID-19 have made many people newly aware that their movements are being tracked and surveilled, governments are already implementing new measures such as geofencing and artificial intelligence (AI)-based facial recognition to facilitate the enforcement of social distancing. The tracking of COVID-19 spread and social distancing behaviors of the public has made more visible the practices of biopolitics but also generated new opportunities for even greater surveillance and control. The current moment offers an opportunity to shift public perceptions about data surveillance, technological control, and the racial disparities of biopower, much in the same way that public perceptions around social media shifted during and after the Arab Spring. How we collectively respond to these biopolitical processes will, in part, determine how such power relations are articulated in the future."

There has been unparalleled use of smartphones and internet services to bear the major pitfall- social distancing- especially for elective treatment services. This demands a new paradigm shift from offline to online doctor-patient, student-educator, researcher-researcher operations. This articles provides an insight into potential role of orthodontic informatics to provide a combined platform to generate a learning system that routinely collects, correlates, and analyzes data for developing artificial intelligence programs, lab exploratory systems, clinical decision support systems and health-information exchange systems. In order to develop this system, orthodontic analytic communities as start-ups for developing user-friendly programs must be encouraged, where orthodontic informatics itself can be taken up as a didactic career source."

        "Author": "Martina Sollini",
        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a field of computer science aimed to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. Currently, AI is recognized in the broader technology radar within the five key technologies which emerge for their wide-ranging applications and impact in communities, companies, business, and value chain framework alike. However, AI in medical imaging is at an early phase of development, and there are still hurdles to take related to reliability, user confidence, and adoption. The present narrative review aimed to provide an overview on AI-based approaches (distributed learning, statistical learning, computer-aided diagnosis and detection systems, fully automated image analysis tool, natural language processing) in oncological hybrid medical imaging with respect to clinical tasks (detection, contouring and segmentation, prediction of histology and tumor stage, prediction of mutational status and molecular therapies targets, prediction of treatment response, and outcome). Particularly, AI-based approaches have been briefly described according to their purpose and, finally lung cancer-being one of the most extensively malignancy studied by hybrid medical imaging-has been used as illustrative scenario. Finally, we discussed clinical challenges and open issues including ethics, validation strategies, effective data-sharing methods, regulatory hurdles, educational resources, and strategy to facilitate the interaction among different stakeholders. Some of the major changes in medical imaging will come from the application of AI to workflow and protocols, eventually resulting in improved patient management and quality of life. Overall, several time-consuming tasks could be automatized. Machine learning algorithms and neural networks will permit sophisticated analysis resulting not only in major improvements in disease characterization through imaging, but also in the integration of multiple-omics data (i.e., derived from pathology, genomic, proteomics, and demographics) for multi-dimensional disease featuring. Nevertheless, to accelerate the transition of the theory to practice a sustainable development plan considering the multi-dimensional interactions between professionals, technology, industry, markets, policy, culture, and civil society directed by a mindset which will allow talents to thrive is necessary."

Significant efforts are necessary to improve the detection of early squamous cell cancer such that curative endoscopic therapy can be offered. Studies have shown an overall miss rate of esophageal cancer of up to 6.4%. Human factors including fatigue and lack of attention may be a contributory factor. Computer aided detection and characterisation of early squamous cell cancer can be a second reader which potentially offsets these factors. Recent studies developing artificial intelligence systems show real promise in the detection of early squamous cell cancer and predicting depth of invasion to aid in the management of patients in the same endoscopic session. This has the potential to revolutionise this area of endoscopy."

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is of keen interest for global health development as potential support for current human shortcomings. Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is an excellent substrate for AI, since it holds the genuine potential to improve quality in GI endoscopy and overall patient care by improving detection and diagnosis guiding the endoscopists in performing endoscopy to the highest quality standards. The possibility of large data acquisitioning to refine algorithms makes implementation of AI into daily practice a potential reality. With the start of a new era adopting deep learning, large amounts of data can easily be processed, resulting in better diagnostic performances. In the upper gastrointestinal tract, research currently focusses on the detection and characterization of neoplasia, including Barrett's, squamous cell and gastric carcinoma, with an increasing amount of AI studies demonstrating the potential and benefit of AI-augmented endoscopy. Deep learning applied to small bowel video capsule endoscopy also appears to enhance pathology detection and reduce capsule reading time. In the colon, multiple prospective trials including five randomized trials, showed a consistent improvement in polyp and adenoma detection rates, one of the main quality indicators in endoscopy. There are however potential additional roles for AI to assist in quality improvement of endoscopic procedures, training and therapeutic decision making. Further large-scale, multicenter validation trials are required before AI-augmented diagnostic gastrointestinal endoscopy can be integrated into our routine clinical practice."

        "Abstract": "Since colonoscopy and polypectomy were introduced, Colorectal Cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality decreased significantly. Although we have entered the era of quality measurement and improvement, literature shows that a considerable amount of colorectal neoplasia is still missed by colonoscopists up to 25%, leading to an high rate of interval colorectal cancer that account for nearly 10% of all diagnosed CRC. Two main reasons have been recognised: recognition failure and mucosal exposure. For this purpose, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have been recently developed that identify a \"hot\" area during the endoscopic examination. In retrospective studies, where the systems are tested with a batch of unknown images, deep learning systems have shown very good performances, with high levels of accuracy. Of course, this setting may not reflect actual clinical practice where different pitfalls can occur, like suboptimal bowel preparation or poor examination technique. For this reason, a number of randomised clinical trials have recently been published where AI was tested in real time during endoscopic examinations. We present here an overview on recent literature addressing the performance of Computer Assisted Detection (CADe) of colorectal polyps in colonoscopy."

Identification of individuals harbouring preneoplastic lesions and their surveillance or of those with early gastric cancer are extremely important processes and endoscopy play a key role for this purpose. Unfortunately, also quality and accuracy for endoscopic detection varies among centres and endoscopists. Recent studies about Artificial Intelligence applied to endoscopic imaging show that these technologies perform very well and could be extremely useful for endoscopists to achieve the accuracy needed for gastric cancer screening. Nonetheless, as its introduction in this field is very recent, most studies are carried out offline and its results in clinical practice need to be further validated namely by incorporating all the components/dimensions of endoscopy from pre to post-assessment."

        "Abstract": "Background/purpose: Facial asymmetry is relatively common in the general population. Here, we propose a fully automated annotation system that supports analysis of mandibular deviation and detection of facial asymmetry in posteroanterior (PA) cephalograms by means of a deep learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm. Materials and methods: In this retrospective study, 400 PA cephalograms were collected from the medical records of patients aged 4 years 2 months-80 years 3 months (mean age, 17 years 10 months; 255 female patients and 145 male patients). A deep CNN with two optimizers and a random forest algorithm were trained using 320 PA cephalograms; in these images, four PA landmarks were independently identified and manually annotated by two orthodontists. Results: The CNN algorithms had a high coefficient of determination (R 2 ), compared with the random forest algorithm (CNN-stochastic gradient descent, R 2 = 0.715; CNN-Adam, R 2 = 0.700; random forest, R 2 = 0.486). Analysis of the best and worst performances of the algorithms for each landmark demonstrated that the right latero-orbital landmark was most difficult to detect accurately by using the CNN. Based on the annotated landmarks, reference lines were defined using an algorithm coded in Python. The CNN and random forest algorithms exhibited similar accuracy for the distance between the menton and vertical reference line. Conclusion: Our findings imply that the proposed deep CNN algorithm for detection of facial asymmetry may enable prompt assessment and reduce the effort involved in orthodontic diagnosis."

        "Abstract": "The use of Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) and related technology is propelling manufacturing into a new era in the fourth industry revolution characterized by ubiquitous connectivity. IIoT allows new and unprecedented interactions amongst hardware, software, and humans. Adopting the capability of IIoT with artificial intelligence tools, manufacturing systems become smart - with unprecedented gains in production agility, quality, and efficiency. One of the key enablers of the IIoT empowered smart manufacturing is connectivity and integration standards. In this paper we review the current IIoT standards used in manufacturing, present a new IIoT standards landscape for the smart manufacturing paradigm, and describe some of IIoT standards gaps."

        "Title": "Application of a machine learning algorithm for detection of atrial fibrillation in secondary care",
        "Author": "Kevin G Pollock",
        "Abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained heart arrhythmia and significantly increases risk of stroke. Opportunistic AF testing in high-risk patients typically requires frequent electrocardiogram tests to capture the arrhythmia. Risk-prediction algorithms may help to more accurately identify people with undiagnosed AF and machine learning (ML) may aid in the diagnosis of AF. Here, we applied an AF-risk prediction algorithm to secondary care data linked to primary care data in the DISCOVER database in order to evaluate changes in model performance, and identify patients not previously detected in primary care. We identified an additional 5,444 patients who had an AF diagnosis only in secondary care during the data extraction period. 2,696 (49.5%) were accepted by the algorithm and the algorithm correctly assigned 2,637 (97.8%) patients to the AF cohort. Using a risk threshold of 7.4% in patients aged ≥ 30 years, algorithm sensitivity and specificity was 38% and 95%, respectively. Approximately 15% of AF patients assigned to the AF cohort by the algorithm had a secondary care diagnosis with no record of AF in primary care. These additional patients did not substantially alter algorithm performance. The additional detection of previously undiagnosed AF patients in secondary care highlights unexpected potential utility of this ML algorithm."

        "Title": "Digitising chemical synthesis in automated and robotic flow",
        "Author": "Tomas Hardwick",
        "Abstract": "Continuous flow chemical synthesis is already known to have many attributes that give it superiority over batch processes in several respects. To expand these advantages with those from automation will only drive such enabling technologies further into the faster producing, more efficient 21st century chemical world. In this report we present several examples of algorithmic chemical search, along with flow platforms that link hardware and digital chemical operations on software. This enables organic syntheses to be automatically carried out and optimised with as little human intervention as possible. By applying such enabling technologies to the production of small organic molecules and pharmaceutical compounds in end-to-end multistep processes, a range of reaction types can be accessed and, thus, the flexibility of these single, compact flow designs may be revealed. Automated systems can allow several reactions to take place on the same setup, enabling direct comparison of reactions under different conditions. Moreover, the production of new and known target compounds can be made faster and more efficient, the recipes of which can then be stored as digital files. Some of the automating software has employed machine-powered learning to assist the chemist in developing intelligent algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) driven synthetic route planning. This ultimately produces a continuous flow platform that can design its own viable pathway to a particular molecule and then carry it out on its own, allowing the chemists, at the same time, to apply their expertise to other pressing challenges in their fields."

        "Author": "Grace C Y Peng",
        "Abstract": "Machine learning is increasingly recognized as a promising technology in the biological, biomedical, and behavioral sciences. There can be no argument that this technique is incredibly successful in image recognition with immediate applications in diagnostics including electrophysiology, radiology, or pathology, where we have access to massive amounts of annotated data. However, machine learning often performs poorly in prognosis, especially when dealing with sparse data. This is a field where classical physics-based simulation seems to remain irreplaceable. In this review, we identify areas in the biomedical sciences where machine learning and multiscale modeling can mutually benefit from one another: Machine learning can integrate physics-based knowledge in the form of governing equations, boundary conditions, or constraints to manage ill-posted problems and robustly handle sparse and noisy data; multiscale modeling can integrate machine learning to create surrogate models, identify system dynamics and parameters, analyze sensitivities, and quantify uncertainty to bridge the scales and understand the emergence of function. With a view towards applications in the life sciences, we discuss the state of the art of combining machine learning and multiscale modeling, identify applications and opportunities, raise open questions, and address potential challenges and limitations. We anticipate that it will stimulate discussion within the community of computational mechanics and reach out to other disciplines including mathematics, statistics, computer science, artificial intelligence, biomedicine, systems biology, and precision medicine to join forces towards creating robust and efficient models for biological systems."

        "Author": "Muhammad Nauman Qureshi",
        "Abstract": "The \"trainee in difficulty\" (TID) can have multiple causative factors which can impact the delivery of an expected standard of skill sets. The communication and interpersonal skills in Emergency Department (ED) setting are key to any trainee's performance in an ED environment where team playing is a major factor in achieving safe and holistic care for patients. Trainer or a young faculty member responsible for the training may not have the emotional intelligence or experience to deal with all the issues faced by the TID. This paper talks about the difficulties faced by an experienced trainee in difficulty, who has changed his career from an experienced ED nurse to a trainee registrar in Emergency Medicine. The second case study is about a young emergency medicine residency program director who fails to appropriately address a trainee's situation and compounds the trainees' issues. The effect of honest, transparent communication of an educational supervisor and setting clear goals for the TID can have a huge impact on trainees' performance. A residency program director's inexperience and poor skills to deal and escalate the trainee's issues may jeopardize a young physicians' career."

        "Abstract": "Change in cortisol affects brain EEG signals. So, the identification of the significant EEG features which are sensitized to cortisol concentration was the aim of the present study. From 468 participated healthy subjects, the salivary samples were taken to test the cortisol concentration and EEG signal recording was done simultaneously. Then, the subjects were categorized into three classes based on the salivary cortisol concentration (<5, 5-15 and >15 nmol/l). Some linear and nonlinear features extracted and finally, in order to investigate the relationship between cortisol level and EEG features, the following steps were taken on features in sequence: Genetic Algorithm, Neighboring Component Analysis, polyfit, artificial neural network and support vector machine classification. Two classifications were considered as following: state 1 categorized the subjects into three groups (three classes) and the second state put them into two groups (group 1: class 1 and 3, group 2: class 2). The best classification was done using ANN in the second state with the accuracy=94.1% while it was 92.7% in the first state. EEG features carefully predicted the cortisol level. This result is applicable to design the intelligence brain computer machines to control stress and brain performance."

Spatial metabolomics and its enabling technology-imaging mass spectrometry-generate big hyper-spectral imaging data that have motivated the development of tailored computational methods at the intersection of computational metabolomics and image analysis. Experimental and computational developments have recently opened doors to applications of spatial metabolomics in life sciences and biomedicine. At the same time, these advances have coincided with a rapid evolution in machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, which are transforming our everyday life and promise to revolutionize biology and healthcare. Here, we introduce spatial metabolomics through the eyes of a computational scientist, review the outstanding challenges, provide a look into the future, and discuss opportunities granted by the ongoing convergence of human and artificial intelligence."

        "Author": "Viorica Marian",
        "Abstract": "The study of bilingualism has a history that extends from deciphering ancient multilingual texts to mapping the structure of the multilingual brain. The language experiences of individual bilinguals are equally diverse and characterized by unique contexts of acquisition and use that can shape not only sociocultural identity, but also cognitive and neural function. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this variability in scholarly perspectives and language experiences has given rise to a range of methods for defining bilingualism. The goal of this paper is to initiate a conversation about the utility of a more unified approach to how we think about, study, and measure bilingualism. Using concrete case studies, we illustrate the value of enhancing communication and streamlining terminology across researchers with different methodologies within questions, different questions within domains, and different domains within scientific inquiry. We specifically consider the utility and feasibility of a Bilingualism Quotient (BQ) construct, discuss the idea of a BQ relative to the well-established Intelligence Quotient (IQ), and include recommendations for next steps. We conclude that though the variability in language backgrounds and approaches to defining bilingualism presents significant challenges, concerted efforts to systematize and synthesize research across the field may enable the construction of a valid and generalizable index of multilingual experience."

        "Abstract": "Deep learning (DL) approaches are part of the machine learning (ML) subfield concerned with the development of computational models to train artificial intelligence systems. DL models are characterized by automatically extracting high-level features from the input data to learn the relationship between matching datasets. Thus, its implementation offers an advantage over common ML methods that often require the practitioner to have some domain knowledge of the input data to select the best latent representation. As a result of this advantage, DL has been successfully applied within the medical imaging field to address problems, such as disease classification and tumor segmentation for which it is difficult or impossible to determine which image features are relevant. Therefore, taking into consideration the positive impact of DL on the medical imaging field, this article reviews the key concepts associated with its evolution and implementation. The sections of this review summarize the milestones related to the development of the DL field, followed by a description of the elements of deep neural network and an overview of its application within the medical imaging field. Subsequently, the key steps necessary to implement a supervised DL application are defined, and associated limitations are discussed."

        "Author": "Fazlullah Khan",
        "Abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) ensures reliable and efficient data exchanges among the industrial processes using Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the cyber-physical systems. In the IIoT ecosystem, devices of industrial applications communicate with each other with little human intervention. They need to act intelligently to safeguard the data confidentiality and devices' authenticity. The ability to gather, process, and store real-time data depends on the quality of data, network connectivity, and processing capabilities of these devices. Pervasive Edge Computing (PEC) is gaining popularity nowadays due to the resource limitations imposed on the sensor-embedded IIoT devices. PEC processes the gathered data at the network edge to reduce the response time for these devices. However, PEC faces numerous research challenges in terms of secured communication, network connectivity, and resource utilization of the edge servers. To address these challenges, we propose a secured and intelligent communication scheme for PEC in an IIoT-enabled infrastructure. In the proposed scheme, forged identities of adversaries, i.e., Sybil devices, are detected by IIoT devices and shared with edge servers to prevent upstream transmission of their malicious data. Upon Sybil attack detection, each edge server executes a parallel Artificial Bee Colony (pABC) algorithm to perform optimal network configuration of IIoT devices. Each edge server performs the job migration to their neighboring servers for load balancing and better network performance, based on their processing and storage capabilities. The experimental results justify the efficiency of our proposed scheme in terms of Sybil attack detection, the convergence curves of our pABC algorithm, delay, throughput, and control overhead of data communication using PEC for IIoT."

        "Author": "Richard Ribón Fletcher",
        "Abstract": "In Low- and Middle- Income Countries (LMICs), machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) offer attractive solutions to address the shortage of health care resources and improve the capacity of the local health care infrastructure. However, AI and ML should also be used cautiously, due to potential issues of fairness and algorithmic bias that may arise if not applied properly. Furthermore, populations in LMICs can be particularly vulnerable to bias and fairness in AI algorithms, due to a lack of technical capacity, existing social bias against minority groups, and a lack of legal protections. In order to address the need for better guidance within the context of global health, we describe three basic criteria (Appropriateness, Fairness, and Bias) that can be used to help evaluate the use of machine learning and AI systems: 1) APPROPRIATENESS is the process of deciding how the algorithm should be used in the local context, and properly matching the machine learning model to the target population; 2) BIAS is a systematic tendency in a model to favor one demographic group vs another, which can be mitigated but can lead to unfairness; and 3) FAIRNESS involves examining the impact on various demographic groups and choosing one of several mathematical definitions of group fairness that will adequately satisfy the desired set of legal, cultural, and ethical requirements. Finally, we illustrate how these principles can be applied using a case study of machine learning applied to the diagnosis and screening of pulmonary disease in Pune, India. We hope that these methods and principles can help guide researchers and organizations working in global health who are considering the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence."

        "Abstract": "Industry 5.0 is the digitalization, automation and data exchange of industrial processes that involve artificial intelligence, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (I-CPS). In healthcare, I-CPS enables the intelligent wearable devices to gather data from the real-world and transmit to the virtual world for decision-making. I-CPS makes our lives comfortable with the emergence of innovative healthcare applications. Similar to any other IIoT paradigm, I-CPS capable healthcare applications face numerous challenging issues. The resource-constrained nature of wearable devices and their inability to support complex security mechanisms provide an ideal platform to malevolent entities for launching attacks. To preserve the privacy of wearable devices and their data in an I-CPS environment, we propose a lightweight mutual authentication scheme. Our scheme is based on client-server interaction model that uses symmetric encryption for establishing secured sessions among the communicating entities. After mutual authentication, the privacy risk associated with a patient data is predicted using an AI-enabled Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We analyzed the robustness and security of our scheme using BurrowsAbadiNeedham (BAN) logic. This analysis shows that the use of lightweight security primitives for the exchange of session keys makes the proposed scheme highly resilient in terms of security, efficiency, and robustness. Finally, the proposed scheme incurs nominal overhead in terms of processing, communication and storage and is capable to combat a wide range of adversarial threats."

        "Author": "Michelle Hanlon",
        "Abstract": "Background: Population ageing and improvements in healthcare mean the number of people living with two or more chronic conditions, or 'multimorbidity', is rapidly increasing. This presents a challenge to current disease-specific care delivery models. Adherence to prescribed medications appears particularly challenging for individuals living with multimorbidity, given the often-complex drug regimens required to treat multiple conditions. Poor adherence is associated with increased mortality, as well as wasted healthcare resources. Supporting medication adherence is a key priority for general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses as they are responsible for much of the disease counselling and medication prescribing associated with chronic illnesses. Despite this, practical resources and training for health practitioners on how to promote adherence in practice is currently lacking. Informed by the principles of patient and public involvement (PPI), the aim of this research was to develop a patient informed e-learning resource to help GPs and nurses support medication adherence. Method: Utilising collective intelligence (CI) and scenario-based design (SBD) methodology, input was gathered from key stakeholders in medication adherence to gain insights into barriers to supporting people with multimorbidity who are receiving polypharmacy, strategies for overcoming these barriers, and user needs and requirements to inform the design of the e-learning tool. Results: In total, 67 barriers to supporting people who are taking multiple medications were identified across 8 barrier categories. 162 options for overcoming the identified barriers were then generated. This data was used in the design of a flexible e-learning tool for continuous professional development, that has been integrated into general practice and clinical education programmes as a supportive tool. Conclusions: Using CI and SBD methodology was an effective way of facilitating collaboration, idea-generation, and the co-creation of design solutions amongst a diverse group of stakeholders. This approach could be usefully applied to address other complex healthcare-related challenges."

        "Author": "Justus Schock",
        "Abstract": "Purpose: To develop and validate a deep learning-based method for automatic quantitative analysis of lower-extremity alignment. Materials and methods: In this retrospective study, bilateral long-leg radiographs (LLRs) from 255 patients that were obtained between January and September of 2018 were included. For training data (n = 109), a U-Net convolutional neural network was trained to segment the femur and tibia versus manual segmentation. For validation data (n = 40), model parameters were optimized. Following identification of anatomic landmarks, anatomic and mechanical axes were identified and used to quantify alignment through the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKAA) and femoral anatomic-mechanical angle (AMA). For testing data (n = 106), algorithm-based angle measurements were compared with reference measurements by two radiologists. Angles and time for 30 random radiographs were compared by using repeated-measures analysis of variance and one-way analysis of variance, whereas correlations were quantified by using Pearson r and intraclass correlation coefficients. Results: Bilateral LLRs of 255 patients (mean age, 26 years ± 23 [standard deviation]; range, 0-88 years; 157 male patients) were included. Mean Sørensen-Dice coefficients for segmentation were 0.97 ± 0.09 for the femur and 0.96 ± 0.11 for the tibia. Mean HKAAs and AMAs as measured by the readers and the algorithm ranged from 0.05° to 0.11° (P = .5) and from 4.82° to 5.43° (P < .001). Interreader correlation coefficients ranged from 0.918 to 0.995 (r range, P < .001), and agreement was almost perfect (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.87-0.99). Automatic analysis was faster than the two radiologists' manual measurements (3 vs 36 vs 35 seconds, P < .001). Conclusion: Fully automated analysis of LLRs yielded accurate results across a wide range of clinical and pathologic indications and is fast enough to enhance and accelerate clinical workflows.Supplemental material is available for this article.© RSNA, 2020See also commentary by Andreisek in this issue."

        "Abstract": "Purpose: To determine how to optimize the delivery of machine learning techniques in a clinical setting to detect intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on non-contrast-enhanced CT images to radiologists to improve workflow. Materials and methods: In this study, a commercially available machine learning algorithm that flags abnormal noncontrast CT examinations for ICH was implemented in a busy academic neuroradiology practice between September 2017 and March 2019. The algorithm was introduced in three phases: (a) as a \"pop-up\" widget on ancillary monitors, (b) as a marked examination in reading worklists, and (c) as a marked examination for reprioritization based on the presence of the flag. A statistical approach, which was based on a queuing theory, was implemented to assess the impact of each intervention on queue-adjusted wait and turnaround time compared with historical controls. Results: Notification with a widget or flagging the examination had no effect on queue-adjusted image wait (P > .99) or turnaround time (P = .6). However, a reduction in queue-adjusted wait time was observed between negative (15.45 minutes; 95% CI: 15.07, 15.38) and positive (12.02 minutes; 95% CI: 11.06, 12.97; P < .0001) artificial intelligence-detected ICH examinations with reprioritization. Reduced wait time was present for all order classes but was greatest for examinations ordered as routine for both inpatients and outpatients because of their low priority. Conclusion: The approach used to present flags from artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to the radiologist can reduce image wait time and turnaround times.© RSNA, 2021See also the commentary by O'Connor and Bhalla in this issue."

Materials and methods: In this retrospective study, US images obtained between May 2010 and June 2019 from 419 patients (mean age, 52 years ± 18 [standard deviation]; 250 women) with histologic diagnosis confirmed at biopsy or surgical excision (n = 227) or masses that demonstrated imaging characteristics of lipoma, benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and vascular malformation (n = 192) were included. Images in patients with a histologic diagnosis (n = 227) were used to train and evaluate a CNN model to distinguish malignant and benign lesions. Twenty percent of cases were withheld as a test dataset, and the remaining cases were used to train the model with a 75%-25% training-validation split and fourfold cross-validation. Performance of the model was compared with retrospective interpretation of the same dataset by two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists, blinded to clinical history. A second group of US images from 275 of the 419 patients containing the three common benign masses was used to train and evaluate a separate model to differentiate between the masses. The models were trained on the Keras machine learning platform (version 2.3.1), with a modified pretrained VGG16 network. Performance metrics of the model and of the radiologists were compared by using the McNemar test, and 95% CIs for performance metrics were estimated by using the Clopper-Pearson method (accuracy, recall, specificity, and precision) and the DeLong method (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Results: The model trained to classify malignant and benign masses demonstrated an accuracy of 79% (95% CI: 68, 88) on the test data, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.98), matching the performance of two expert readers. Performance of the model distinguishing three benign masses was lower, with an accuracy of 71% (95% CI: 61, 80) on the test data. Conclusion: The trained CNN was capable of differentiating between benign and malignant soft-tissue masses depicted on US images, with performance matching that of two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists.© RSNA, 2020."

Materials and methods: In this retrospective study, 22 960 de-identified frontal chest radiographs from 11 153 patients (average age, 60.2 years ± 19.9 [standard deviation], 55.6% men) between 2010 and 2018 containing an ETT were placed into 12 categories, including bronchial insertion and distance from the carina at 1.0-cm intervals (0.0-0.9 cm, 1.0-1.9 cm, etc), and greater than 10 cm. Images were split into training (80%, 18 368 images), validation (10%, 2296 images), and internal test (10%, 2296 images), derived from the same institution as the training data. One hundred external test radiographs were also obtained from a different hospital. The Inception V3 deep neural network was used to predict ETT-carina distance. ETT-carina distances and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for the radiologists and artificial intelligence (AI) system were calculated on a subset of 100 random internal and 100 external test images. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for low and high ETT position thresholds. Results: On the internal and external test images, respectively, the ICCs of AI and radiologists were 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.92) and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.94); the ICCs of the radiologists were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.90, 0.95) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.90).

Conclusion: Deep learning predicted ETT-carina distance within 1 cm in most cases and showed excellent interrater agreement compared with radiologists.

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI-ML) have taken center stage in medical imaging. To develop as leaders in AI-ML, radiology residents may seek a formative data science experience. The authors piloted an elective Data Science Pathway (DSP) for 4th-year residents at the authors' institution in collaboration with the MGH & BWH Center for Clinical Data Science (CCDS). The goal of the DSP was to provide an introduction to AI-ML through a flexible schedule of educational, experiential, and research activities. The study describes the initial experience with the DSP tailored to the AI-ML interests of three senior radiology residents. The authors also discuss logistics and curricular design with common core elements and shared mentorship. Residents were provided dedicated, full-time immersion into the CCDS work environment. In the initial DSP pilot, residents were successfully integrated into AI-ML projects at CCDS. Residents were exposed to all aspects of AI-ML application development, including data curation, model design, quality control, and clinical testing. Core concepts in AI-ML were taught through didactic sessions and daily collaboration with data scientists and other staff. Work during the pilot period led to 12 accepted abstracts for presentation at national meetings. The DSP is a feasible, well-rounded introductory experience in AI-ML for senior radiology residents. Residents contributed to model and tool development at multiple stages and were academically productive. Feedback from the pilot resulted in establishment of a formal AI-ML curriculum for future residents. The described logistical, planning, and curricular considerations provide a framework for DSP implementation at other institutions. Supplemental material is available for this article. © RSNA, 2020."

        "Author": "Yasasvi Tadavarthi",
        "Abstract": "Purpose: To provide an overview of important factors to consider when purchasing radiology artificial intelligence (AI) software and current software offerings by type, subspecialty, and modality. Materials and methods: Important factors for consideration when purchasing AI software, including key decision makers, data ownership and privacy, cost structures, performance indicators, and potential return on investment are described. For the market overview, a list of radiology AI companies was aggregated from the Radiological Society of North America and the Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine conferences (November 2016-June 2019), then narrowed to companies using deep learning for imaging analysis and diagnosis. Software created for image enhancement, reporting, or workflow management was excluded. Software was categorized by task (repetitive, quantitative, explorative, and diagnostic), modality, and subspecialty. Results: A total of 119 software offerings from 55 companies were identified. There were 46 algorithms that currently have Food and Drug Administration and/or Conformité Européenne approval (as of November 2019). Of the 119 offerings, distribution of software targets was 34 of 70 (49%), 21 of 70 (30%), 14 of 70 (20%), and one of 70 (1%) for diagnostic, quantitative, repetitive, and explorative tasks, respectively. A plurality of companies are focused on nodule detection at chest CT and two-dimensional mammography. There is very little activity in certain subspecialties, including pediatrics and nuclear medicine. A comprehensive table is available on the website hitilab.org/pages/ai-companies. Conclusion: The radiology AI marketplace is rapidly maturing, with an increase in product offerings. Radiologists and practice administrators should educate themselves on current product offerings and important factors to consider before purchase and implementation.© RSNA, 2020See also the invited commentary by Sala and Ursprung in this issue."

        "Title": "Improving Breast Cancer Detection Accuracy of Mammography with the Concurrent Use of an Artificial Intelligence Tool",
        "Author": "Serena Pacilè",
        "Abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the benefits of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool for two-dimensional mammography in the breast cancer detection process. Materials and methods: In this multireader, multicase retrospective study, 14 radiologists assessed a dataset of 240 digital mammography images, acquired between 2013 and 2016, using a counterbalance design in which half of the dataset was read without AI and the other half with the help of AI during a first session and vice versa during a second session, which was separated from the first by a washout period. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and reading time were assessed as endpoints. Results: The average AUC across readers was 0.769 (95% CI: 0.724, 0.814) without AI and 0.797 (95% CI: 0.754, 0.840) with AI. The average difference in AUC was 0.028 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.055, P = .035). Average sensitivity was increased by 0.033 when using AI support (P = .021). Reading time changed dependently to the AI-tool score. For low likelihood of malignancy (< 2.5%), the time was about the same in the first reading session and slightly decreased in the second reading session. For higher likelihood of malignancy, the reading time was on average increased with the use of AI. Conclusion: This clinical investigation demonstrated that the concurrent use of this AI tool improved the diagnostic performance of radiologists in the detection of breast cancer without prolonging their workflow.Supplemental material is available for this article.© RSNA, 2020."

        "Title": "Subspecialty-Level Deep Gray Matter Differential Diagnoses with Deep Learning and Bayesian Networks on Clinical Brain MRI: A Pilot Study",
        "Author": "Jeffrey D Rudie",
        "Abstract": "Purpose: To develop and validate a system that could perform automated diagnosis of common and rare neurologic diseases involving deep gray matter on clinical brain MRI studies. Materials and methods: In this retrospective study, multimodal brain MRI scans from 212 patients (mean age, 55 years ± 17 [standard deviation]; 113 women) with 35 neurologic diseases and normal brain MRI scans obtained between January 2008 and January 2018 were included (110 patients in the training set, 102 patients in the test set). MRI scans from 178 patients (mean age, 48 years ± 17; 106 women) were used to supplement training of the neural networks. Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks and atlas-based image processing were used for extraction of 11 imaging features. Expert-derived Bayesian networks incorporating domain knowledge were used for differential diagnosis generation. The performance of the artificial intelligence (AI) system was assessed by comparing diagnostic accuracy with that of radiologists of varying levels of specialization by using the generalized estimating equation with robust variance estimator for the top three differential diagnoses (T3DDx) and the correct top diagnosis (TDx), as well as with receiver operating characteristic analyses. Results: In the held-out test set, the imaging pipeline detected 11 key features on brain MRI scans with 89% accuracy (sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 95%) relative to academic neuroradiologists. The Bayesian network, integrating imaging features with clinical information, had an accuracy of 85% for T3DDx and 64% for TDx, which was better than that of radiology residents (n = 4; 56% for T3DDx, 36% for TDx; P < .001 for both) and general radiologists (n = 2; 53% for T3DDx, 31% for TDx; P < .001 for both). The accuracy of the Bayesian network was better than that of neuroradiology fellows (n = 2) for T3DDx (72%; P = .003) but not for TDx (59%; P = .19) and was not different from that of academic neuroradiologists (n = 2; 84% T3DDx, 65% TDx; P > .09 for both). Conclusion: A hybrid AI system was developed that simultaneously provides a quantitative assessment of disease burden, explainable intermediate imaging features, and a probabilistic differential diagnosis that performed at the level of academic neuroradiologists. This type of approach has the potential to improve clinical decision making for common and rare diseases.Supplemental material is available for this article.© RSNA, 2020."

        "Author": "Yue You",
        "Abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing interest in developing AI-enabled chatbot-based symptom checker (CSC) apps in the healthcare market. CSC apps provide potential diagnoses for users and assist them with self-triaging based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques using human-like conversations. Despite the popularity of such CSC apps, little research has been done to investigate their functionalities and user experiences. To do so, we conducted a feature review, a user review analysis, and an interview study. We found that the existing CSC apps lack the functions to support the whole diagnostic process of an offline medical visit. We also found that users perceive the current CSC apps to lack support for a comprehensive medical history, flexible symptom input, comprehensible questions, and diverse diseases and user groups. Based on these results, we derived implications for the future features and conversational design of CSC apps."

        "Author": "Parthasarathy Suryanarayanan",
        "Abstract": "A patient's electronic health record (EHR) contains extensive documentation of the patient's medical history but is difficult for clinicians to review and find what they are looking for under the time constraints of the clinical setting. Although recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare have shown promise in enhancing clinical diagnosis and decision-making in clinicians' day-to-day tasks, the problem of how to implement and scale such computationally expensive analytics remains an open issue. In this work, we present a system architecture that generates AI-based insights from analysis of the entire patient medical record for a multispecialty outpatient facility of over 700,000 patients. Our resulting system is able to generate insights efficiently while handling complexities of scheduling to deliver the results in a timely manner, and handle more than 30,000 updates per day while achieving desirable operating cost-performance goals."

        "Abstract": "Previous research has studied medical professionals' perception of artificial intelligence (AI). However, there has been a limited understanding of how healthcare consumers perceive and use AI-powered technologies such as mobile health apps. We collected 40 popular mobile health apps that claim to have adopted AI, to study how AI is explained in these apps' descriptions, and how users react to it through app reviews. We found that four AI features (Recommendation, Conversational Agent, Recognition, and Prediction) are frequently used across seven health domains, including Fitness, Mental Health, Meditation and Sleep, Nutrition and Diet, etc. Our results show that (1) users have unique expectations toward each AI features, such as including feedback for recommendations, humanlike experience for conversational agents, and accuracy for recognition and prediction; (2) when AI is not adequately described, users make their own attempts to understand AI and to find out how (well) it works."

        "Abstract": "Applying state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing on approximately one million of teleconsultation records, we developed a triage system, now certified and in use at the largest European telemedicine provider. The system evaluates care alternatives through interactions with patients via a mobile application. Reasoning on an initial set of provided symptoms, the triage application generates AI-powered, personalized questions to better characterize the problem and recommends the most appropriate point of care and time frame for a consultation. The underlying technology was developed to meet the needs for performance, transparency, user acceptance and ease of use, central aspects to the adoption of AI-based decision support systems. Providing such remote guidance at the beginning of the chain of care has significant potential for improving cost efficiency, patient experience and outcomes. Being remote, always available and highly scalable, this service is fundamental in high demand situations, such as the current COVID-19 outbreak."

        "Author": "Akram E Elsadek",
        "Abstract": "Background: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common disorder in children, but its etiology and pathogenesis are still unclear. Aims: The aims of this study were to measure the level of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) as markers of immune system involvement in children with ADHD, and to study their correlation with symptoms severity of ADHD. Materials and methods: The study was conducted on 80 children diagnosed as ADHD based on the criteria adapted from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition. Eighty healthy children of matched age and sex served as a control group. All children enrolled in the study were subjected to history taking, clinical examination, and psychometric tests. Assay for serum IL-6 and TNF-α for all patients and controls was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The mean serum level of IL-6 was 26.11 ± 11.14 and 6.23 ± 2.52 in children with ADHD and controls, respectively. Children with ADHD showed significantly higher serum IL-6 levels than the control group (P = 0.001). Serum IL-6 showed no significant correlation with the intelligence quotient (IQ) or the Abbreviated Conners' Rating Scale scores for parents. However, TNF-α showed no significant differences between the two groups and no significant correlation with the IQ or the Abbreviated Conners' Rating Scale scores for parents. Conclusion: Serum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in children with ADHD compared to controls; however, the IL-6 levels did not correlate with ADHD symptoms severity. Increased IL-6 levels may contribute to the etiology of ADHD."

WE significantly increases adenoma detection and AI holds the potential to help endoscopists detect more polyps and adenomas. We performed an electronic literature search on PubMed using the following keywords: water-assisted and water exchange colonoscopy, adenoma and polyp detection, artificial intelligence, deep learning, neural networks, and computer-aided colonoscopy. We reviewed relevant articles published in English from 2010 to May 2020. Additional articles were searched manually from the reference lists of the publications reviewed. We discussed recent advances in both WE and AI, including their advantages and limitations. AI may mitigate operator-dependent factors that limit the potential of WE. By increasing bowel cleanliness and improving visualization, WE may provide the platform to optimize the performance of AI for colonoscopies. The strengths of WE and AI may complement each other in spite of their weaknesses to maximize adenoma detection."

        "Author": "Patrik Sibolt",
        "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Studies have demonstrated the potential of online adaptive radiotherapy (oART). However, routine use has been limited due to resource demanding solutions. This study reports on experiences with oART in the pelvic region using a novel cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-based, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven solution. Material and methods: Automated pre-treatment planning for thirty-nine pelvic cases (bladder, rectum, anal, and prostate), and one hundred oART simulations were conducted in a pre-clinical release of Ethos (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Plan quality, AI-segmentation accuracy, oART feasibility and an integrated calculation-based quality assurance solution were evaluated. Experiences from the first five clinical oART patients (three bladder, one rectum and one sarcoma) are reported. Results: Auto-generated pre-treatment plans demonstrated similar planning target volume (PTV) coverage and organs at risk doses, compared to institution reference. More than 75% of AI-segmentations during simulated oART required none or minor editing and the adapted plan was superior in 88% of cases. Limitations in AI-segmentation correlated to cases where AI model training was lacking. The five first treated patients complied well with the median adaptive procedure duration of 17.6 min (from CBCT acceptance to treatment delivery start). The treated bladder patients demonstrated a 42% median primary PTV reduction, indicating a 24%-30% reduction in V45Gy to the bowel cavity, compared to non-ART. Conclusions: A novel commercial oART solution was demonstrated feasible for various pelvic sites. Clinically acceptable AI-segmentation and auto-planning enabled adaptation within reasonable timeslots. Possibilities for reduced PTVs observed for bladder cancer indicated potential for toxicity reductions."

        "Abstract": "We report on a series of workshops with musicians and robotics engineers aimed to study how human and machine improvisation can be explored through interdisciplinary design research. In the first workshop, we posed two leading questions to participants. First, what can AI and robotics learn by how improvisers think about time, space, actions, and decisions? Second, how can improvisation and musical instruments be enhanced by AI and robotics? The workshop included sessions led by the musicians, which provided an overview of the theory and practice of musical improvisation. In other sessions, AI and robotics researchers introduced AI principles to the musicians. Two smaller follow-up workshops comprised of only engineering and information science students provided an opportunity to elaborate on the principles covered in the first workshop. The workshops revealed parallels and discrepancies in the conceptualization of improvisation between musicians and engineers. These thematic differences could inform considerations for future designers of improvising robots."

Innovative research that leverages Big Data can dramatically advance the fields of medicine and public health but can also raise new ethical challenges. This paper explores these challenges, and how they might be addressed such that individuals are optimally protected. Key ethical concerns raised by Big Data research include respecting patient's autonomy via provision of adequate consent, ensuring equity, and respecting participants' privacy. Examples of actions that could be taken to address these key concerns on a broader regulatory level, as well as on a case specific level, are presented. Big Data research offers enormous potential, but due to its widespread influence, it also introduces the potential for extensive harm. It is imperative to consider and account for the risks associated with this research."

Aim: Ditto objective of the present research is to investigate the relationship between technological addictions and trait emotional intelligence (EI) in adolescents with ADHD. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 150 treatment-naïve adolescents with ADHD, aged 12-18 years. The sociodemographic information form, the Emotional Quotient-Inventory: Youth Version (EQ-i: YV), Internet Addiction Test, Smartphone Addiction Scale, and Conners' Parent Rating Scales were used for data collection. Results: The findings revealed that ADHD-C and female patients have lower mean stress management scores on EQ-i: YV. Patients who have smartphone addiction (SA)/problematic internet usage have lower total EI and stress management scores. The oppositional, hyperactivity, and DSM-total scores were negatively correlated with stress management scores. Intrapersonal and stress management scores were negatively correlated to SA symptoms. Conclusion: The stress management dimension was the strongest factor related to ADHD and technological addictions. In adolescents with ADHD, stress management may be the key factor to cope with daily problems. Therefore, the interventions to develop EI can be a therapeutic option in ADHD and technological addictions."

        "Abstract": "Analysis of sleep patterns in patients with chronic disorders of consciousness attracts attention from the perspective of the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease as well as the treatment. Yet, the very existence of normal sleep in patients in a vegetative or minimally conscious state is still a matter of debate. This paper presents a retrospective analysis of overnight polysomnographic records of 40 patients with chronic disorders of consciousness aimed at the possibility of establishing the connection between the degree of impaired consciousness and the presence and organization of polysomnographic graphical elements, associated with stages of sleep in normal individuals. Specialized software based on expert system artificial intelligence was developed to calculate indices and parameters that characterize sleep. It was shown that a remarkably low percentage of patients have a rhythmic change in sleep patterns, what indicates the prevalence of violations of the Sleep-Wake cycle in a vegetative state and minimally conscious state. Sleep spindles were not found in records, however, the absence can originate from the limitations of polysomnographic method applied to patients with severe brain damage. A positive correlation between the rhythmic change of sleep patterns, better outcome and CRS-R scores was confirmed."

        "Abstract": "Scientific research communities can be represented as heterogeneous or multidimensional networks encompassing multiple types of entities and relationships. These networks might include researchers, institutions, meetings, and publications, connected by relationships like authorship, employment, and attendance. We describe a method for efficiently and flexibly capturing, storing, and extracting information from multidimensional scientific networks using a graph database. The database structure is based on an ontology that captures allowable types of entities and relationships. This allows us to construct a variety of projections of the underlying multidimensional graph through database queries to answer specific research questions. We demonstrate this process through a study of the U.S. Biological Threat Reduction Program (BTRP), which seeks to develop Threat Reduction Networks to build and strengthen a sustainable international community of biosecurity, biosafety, and biosurveillance experts to address shared biological threat reduction challenges. Networks like these create connectional intelligence among researchers and institutions around the world, and are central to the concept of cooperative threat reduction. Our analysis focuses on a series of seven BTRP genome sequencing training workshops, showing how they created a growing network of participants and countries over time, which is also reflected in coauthorship relationships among attendees. By capturing concept and relationship hierarchies, our ontology-based approach allows us to pose general or specific questions about networks within the same framework. This approach can be applied to other research communities or multidimensional social networks to capture, analyze, and visualize different types of interactions and how they change over time."

        "Author": "Elahe Allahyari",
        "Abstract": "Emotional intelligence (EI) constitutes a whole set of non-cognitive capabilities, competencies, and skills that affect one's ability to deal successfully with environmental demands and pressures. Different factors such as gender, age, education, place of residence, etc. can influence this variable. Nevertheless, the influence of a multitude of factors involved in behavioral phenomena cannot often be controlled. Purpose: Therefore, some difficulty may often raise in finding associations between these variables using regression models as regression models are built on restrictive assumptions. Methods: In these cases, models such as artificial neural networks are excellent alternatives to regression models. In this study, the neural network model was used in SPSS software to predict the pattern held among the variables of age, gender, occupation, marital status, and education for predicting the EI of 901 individuals aged from 17 to 73 years. Results: The appropriate neural network model for EI prediction is a hyperbolic tangent transfer function with two neurons in the hidden layer and a sigmoid transfer function in the output layer. This network was able to predict EI in most of its dimensions with significant correlations and could demonstrate the neural network's advantage over regression models in predicting EI using sociological variables. Conclusion: This model is able to estimate the EI level in different occupational, educational, gender, and age groups, and provide the ground for planning to address potential deficiencies in each group."

        "Author": "Abdolkarim Saeedi",
        "Abstract": "Deep learning techniques have recently made considerable advances in the field of artificial intelligence. These methodologies can assist psychologists in early diagnosis of mental disorders and preventing severe trauma. Major Depression Disorder (MDD) is a common and serious medical condition whose exact manifestations are not fully understood. So, early discovery of MDD patients helps to cure or limit the adverse effects. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is prominently used to study brain diseases such as MDD due to having high temporal resolution information, and being a noninvasive, inexpensive and portable method. This paper has proposed an EEG-based deep learning framework that automatically discriminates MDD patients from healthy controls. First, the relationships among EEG channels in the form of effective brain connectivity analysis are extracted by Generalized Partial Directed Coherence (GPDC) and Direct directed transfer function (dDTF) methods. A novel combination of sixteen connectivity methods (GPDC and dDTF in eight frequency bands) was used to construct an image for each individual. Finally, the constructed images of EEG signals are applied to the five different deep learning architectures. The first and second algorithms were based on one and two-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN-2DCNN). The third method is based on long short-term memory (LSTM) model, while the fourth and fifth algorithms utilized a combination of CNN with LSTM model namely, 1DCNN-LSTM and 2DCNN-LSTM. The proposed deep learning architectures automatically learn patterns in the constructed image of the EEG signals. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is evaluated on resting state EEG data obtained from 30 healthy subjects and 34 MDD patients. The experiments show that the 1DCNN-LSTM applied on constructed image of effective connectivity achieves best results with accuracy of 99.24% due to specific architecture which captures the presence of spatial and temporal relations in the brain connectivity. The proposed method as a diagnostic tool is able to help clinicians for diagnosing the MDD patients for early diagnosis and treatment."

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to diagnose the incidence of restless leg syndrome (RLS) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) type-2, thorough artificial intelligence based multilayer perceptron (MLP). 300 cases of diabetes mellitus type-2, of age between 18-80 years were included. Point-biserial correlation/Pearson Chi-Square correlations were conducted between RLS and risk factors. We trained a backpropagation MLP via. supervised learning algorithm to predict clinical outcome for RLS. Majority of the patients were having hypertension (63%) and with peripheral neuropathy (69%). Two mostly reported scaled parameters were: 18% 'tiredness' and 14%, 'impact on mood'. A significant correlation was found in RLS with smoking, hypertension and chronic renal failure (CRF). MLP model achieved more than 95% accuracy in predicting the outcome with cross entropy error 0.5%. Following scaled symptomatic variables: 'need/urge to move' (100%) achieved the highest normalized importance, followed by 'relief by moving' (85.7%), 'sleep disturbance' (62%) and 'impact on mood' (51.3%). Artificial intelligence based models can help physicians to identify the pre diagnose RLS, so that active measures can be taken in time to avoid further complications."

        "Abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the success rates of the artificial neural network models (NNMs) and naive Bayes models (NBMs) trained with various cervical vertebra ratios in cephalometric radiographs for determining growth and development. Methods: Our retrospective study was performed on 360 individuals between the ages of 8 and 17 years, whose cephalometric radiographs were taken. According to the evaluation of cephalometric radiographs, growth and development periods were divided into 6 vertebral stages. Each stage was considered as a group, each group had 30 girls and 30 boys. Twenty-eight cervical vertebral ratios were obtained by using 10 horizontal and 13 vertical measurements. These 28 vertebral ratios were combined in 4 different combinations, leading to 4 different datasets. Each dataset was split into 2 parts as training and testing. To prevent the overfitting, a 5-cross fold validation technique was also used in the training phase. The experiments were conducted on 2 different train/test ratios as 80%-20% and 70%-30% for both NNMs and NBMs. Results: The highest determination success rate was obtained in NNM 3 (0.95) and the lowest in NBM 4 (0.50). The determination success of NBM 1 and NBM 3 was almost similar (0.60). The success of NNM 2 did not differ much from that of NNM 1 (0.94). The determination success of stage 5 was relatively lower than the others in NNM 1 and NNM 2 (0.83). Conclusion: The NNMs were more successful than the NBMs in our developed models. It is important to determine the effective ratio and/or measurements that will be useful for differentiation."

        "Author": "Maryam Zand",
        "Abstract": "The advancement in single-cell RNA sequencing technologies allow us to obtain transcriptome at single cell resolution. However, the original spatial context of cells, a crucial knowledge for understanding cellular and tissue-level functions, is often lost during sequencing. To address this issue, the DREAM Single Cell Transcriptomics Challenge launched a community-wide effort to seek computational solutions for spatial mapping of single cells in tissues using single-cell RNAseq (scRNA-seq) data and a reference atlas obtained from in situ hybridization data. As a top-performing team in this competition, we approach this problem in three steps. The first step involves identifying a set of most informative genes based on the consistency between gene expression similarity and cell proximity. For this step, we propose two different approaches, i.e., an unsupervised approach that does not utilize the gold standard location of the cells provided by the challenge organizers, and a supervised approach that relies on the gold standard locations. In the second step, a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is used to optimize the weights of different genes in order to maximize matches between the predicted locations and the gold standard locations. Finally, the information embedded in the cell topology is used to improve the predicted cell-location scores by weighted averaging of scores from neighboring locations. Evaluation results based on DREAM scores show that our method accurately predicts the location of single cells, and the predictions lead to successful recovery of the spatial expression patterns for most of landmark genes. In addition, investigating the selected genes demonstrates that most predictive genes are cluster specific, and stable across our supervised and unsupervised gene selection frameworks. Overall, the promising results obtained by our methods in DREAM challenge demonstrated that topological consistency is a useful concept in identifying marker genes and constructing predictive models for spatial mapping of single cells."

        "Author": "Li He",
        "Abstract": "Background: The prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients is high, with poor prognosis. Early identification of COVID-19 patients who are at risk for AKI and may develop critical illness and death is of great importance. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prognostic model of AKI and in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19, incorporating the new tubular injury biomarker urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (u-NGAL) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based chest computed tomography (CT) analysis. Methods: A single-center cohort of patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital were included in this study. Demographic characteristics, laboratory findings, and AI-assisted chest CT imaging variables identified on hospital admission were screened using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to develop a model for predicting the AKI risk. The accuracy of the AKI prediction model was measured using the concordance index (C-index), and the internal validity of the model was assessed by bootstrap resampling. A multivariate Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier curves were analyzed for survival analysis in COVID-19 patients. Results: One hundred seventy-four patients were included. The median (±SD) age of the patients was 63.59 ± 13.79 years, and 83 (47.7%) were men.u-NGAL, serum creatinine, serum uric acid, and CT ground-glass opacity (GGO) volume were independent predictors of AKI, and all were selected in the nomogram. The prediction model was validated by internal bootstrapping resampling, showing results similar to those obtained from the original samples (i.e., 0.958; 95% CI 0.9097-0.9864). The C-index for predicting AKI was 0.955 (95% CI 0.916-0.995). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed that a high u-NGAL level, an increased GGO volume, and lymphopenia are strong predictors of a poor prognosis and a high risk of in-hospital death. Conclusions: This model provides a useful individualized risk estimate of AKI in patients with COVID-19. Measurement of u-NGAL and AI-based chest CT quantification are worthy of application and may help clinicians to identify patients with a poor prognosis in COVID-19 at an early stage."

        "Author": "Fahad F Alruwaili",
        "Abstract": "Background: Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the use of agent-based systems in the healthcare system have attracted various researchers to improve the efficiency and utility in the Electronic Health Records (EHR). Nowadays, one of the most important and creative developments is the integration of AI and Blockchain that is, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to enable better and decentralized governance. Privacy and security is a critical piece in EHR implementation and/or adoption. Health records are updated every time a patient visits a doctor as they contain important information about the health and wellbeing of the patient and describes the history of care received during the past and to date. Therefore, such records are critical to research, hospitals, emergency rooms, healthcare laboratories, and even health insurance providers. Methods: In this article, a platform employing the AI and the use of multi-agent based systems along with the DLT technology for privacy preservation is proposed. The emphasis of security and privacy is highlighted during the process of collecting, managing and distributing EHR data. Results: This article aims to ensure privacy, integrity and security metrics of the electronic health records are met when such copies are not only immutable but also distributed. The findings of this work will help guide the development of further techniques using the combination of AI and multi-agent based systems backed by DLT technology for secure and effective handling EHR data. This proposed architecture uses various AI-based intelligent based agents and blockchain for providing privacy and security in EHR. Future enhancement in this work can be the addition of the biometric based systems for improved security."

        "Author": "Antonio García-Domínguez",
        "Abstract": "Children activity recognition (CAR) is a subject for which numerous works have been developed in recent years, most of them focused on monitoring and safety. Commonly, these works use as data source different types of sensors that can interfere with the natural behavior of children, since these sensors are embedded in their clothes. This article proposes the use of environmental sound data for the creation of a children activity classification model, through the development of a deep artificial neural network (ANN). Initially, the ANN architecture is proposed, specifying its parameters and defining the necessary values for the creation of the classification model. The ANN is trained and tested in two ways: using a 70-30 approach (70% of the data for training and 30% for testing) and with a k-fold cross-validation approach. According to the results obtained in the two validation processes (70-30 splitting and k-fold cross validation), the ANN with the proposed architecture achieves an accuracy of 94.51% and 94.19%, respectively, which allows to conclude that the developed model using the ANN and its proposed architecture achieves significant accuracy in the children activity classification by analyzing environmental sound."

        "Author": "Dina A Ragab",
        "Abstract": "The precise and rapid diagnosis of coronavirus (COVID-19) at the very primary stage helps doctors to manage patients in high workload conditions. In addition, it prevents the spread of this pandemic virus. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can be used to distinguish between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 from the computed tomography (CT) imaging. Furthermore, the CAD systems are capable of delivering an accurate faster COVID-19 diagnosis, which consequently saves time for the disease control and provides an efficient diagnosis compared to laboratory tests. In this study, a novel CAD system called FUSI-CAD based on AI techniques is proposed. Almost all the methods in the literature are based on individual convolutional neural networks (CNN). Consequently, the FUSI-CAD system is based on the fusion of multiple different CNN architectures with three handcrafted features including statistical features and textural analysis features such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) which were not previously utilized in coronavirus diagnosis. The SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan dataset is used to test the performance of the proposed FUSI-CAD. The results show that the proposed system could accurately differentiate between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 images, as the accuracy achieved is 99%. Additionally, the system proved to be reliable as well. This is because the sensitivity, specificity, and precision attained to 99%. In addition, the diagnostics odds ratio (DOR) is ≥ 100. Furthermore, the results are compared with recent related studies based on the same dataset. The comparison verifies the competence of the proposed FUSI-CAD over the other related CAD systems. Thus, the novel FUSI-CAD system can be employed in real diagnostic scenarios for achieving accurate testing for COVID-19 and avoiding human misdiagnosis that might exist due to human fatigue. It can also reduce the time and exertion made by the radiologists during the examination process."

        "Author": "Zahra Ghomi",
        "Abstract": "Background: Lung CT scan has a pivotal role in diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 patients, and with growing number of affected individuals, the need for artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems for interpretation of CT images is emerging. In current investigation we introduce a new deep learning-based automatic segmentation model for localization of COVID-19 pulmonary lesions. Methods: A total of 2469 CT scan slices, containing 1402 manually segmented abnormal and 1067 normal slices form 55 COVID-19 patients and 41 healthy individuals, were used to train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on Detectron2, an open-source modular object detection library. A dataset, including 1224 CT slices of 18 COVID-19 patients and 9 healthy individuals, was used to test the model. Results: The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the trained model in marking a single image slice with COVID-19 lesion were 0.954, 0.928, and 0.961, respectively. Considering a threshold of 0.4% for percentage of lung involvement, the model was capable of diagnosing the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, with a sensitivity of 0.982% and a specificity of 88.5%. Furthermore, the mean Intersection over Union (IoU) index for the test dataset was 0.865. Conclusion: The deep learning-based automatic segmentation method provides an acceptable accuracy in delineation and localization of COVID-19 lesions, assisting the clinicians and researchers for quantification of abnormal findings in chest CT scans. Moreover, instance segmentation is capable of monitoring longitudinal changes of the lesions, which could be beneficial to patients' follow-up."

The aim of the present study was to compare the intellectual and behavioral adjustment of CH children with controls. Methods: This study was conducted among a group of 135 children aged 8--12 years in Isfahan, including transient and permanent congenital hypothyroidism (TCH and PCH) and a matched group of their classmate. Demographic characteristics collected using a designed data collecting form completed by parents. Intellectual quotient (IQ) was evaluated using Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children aged 6--16 years (WISC-III). Depression and anxiety were evaluated using The Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC), respectively. The SPSS software version 20.0 was used for data analysis. Nonparametric tests (Mann--Whitney) were used to investigate the association between variables. A significant level of less than 0.05 was considered in all analyzes. Results: There was no significant difference in the IQ scores between PCH and TCH groups (P = NS). However, neither of them had intellectual disability (defined as IQ <70). IQ scores were significantly lower in PCH comparing to controls (P < 0.001). Total IQ and verbal IQ were significantly differenct between TCH and control group (P = 0.007 and P = 0.001). No significant difference was found in anxiety and depression scores between CH children and controls. Conclusions: There is no significant difference in anxiety and depression scores between congenital hypothyroidism children and controls, although IQ scores in children with congenital hypothyroidism is lower than controls."

        "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate the clinical effect and safety of moxibustion therapy based on Sancai theory for reinforcing intelligence in the early intervention of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: A total of 210 patients with MCI were divided into moxibustion group and medication group using a random number table, with 105 patients in each group. The patients in the moxibustion group were given moxibustion at Baihui (GV20), Shenque (CV8), and Yongquan (KI1) once every other day, 20 minutes each time, for a total of 8 weeks, and those in the medication group were given oral Nimodipine 30 mg once a day for 8 weeks. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, score of meaningless graphics recognition of Clinical Memory Scale (CMS), and event-related potential P300 latency were evaluated before treatment, after 8 weeks of treatment, and at 12 weeks after treatment, and the safety of treatment was analyzed for both groups. Results: Both groups had significant increases in MMSE score and the score of meaningless graphics recognition of CMS and a significant reduction in P300 latency after treatment and during follow-up (P<0.01,P<0.05). Compared with the medication group, the moxibustion group had a significant increase in MMSE score and a significant reduction in P300 latency after treatment (P<0.05). Conclusion: Moxibustion therapy based on Sancai theory for reinforcing intelligence can improve cognitive impairment in patients with MCI and is thus an effective intervention method for improving the cognitive function of patients with MCI."

        "Abstract": "Recent progress in artificial intelligence has led to the development of automatic behavioral marker recognition, such as facial and vocal expressions. Those automatic tools have enormous potential to support mental health assessment, clinical decision making, and treatment planning. In this paper, we investigate nonverbal behavioral markers of depression severity assessed during semi-structured medical interviews of adolescent patients. The main goal of our research is two-fold: studying a unique population of adolescents at high risk of mental disorders and differentiating mild depression from moderate or severe depression. We aim to explore computationally inferred facial and vocal behavioral responses elicited by three segments of the semi-structured medical interviews: Distress Assessment Questions, Ubiquitous Questions, and Concept Questions. Our experimental methodology reflects best practise used for analyzing small sample size and unbalanced datasets of unique patients. Our results show a very interesting trend with strongly discriminative behavioral markers from both acoustic and visual modalities. These promising results are likely due to the unique classification task (mild depression vs. moderate and severe depression) and three types of probing questions."

        "Abstract": "Advances in computerized image analysis and the use of artificial intelligence-based approaches for image-based analysis and construction of prediction algorithms represent a new era for noninvasive biomarker discovery. In recent literature, it has become apparent that radiologic images can serve as mineable databases that contain large amounts of quantitative features with potential clinical significance. Extraction and analysis of these quantitative features is commonly referred to as texture or radiomic analysis. Numerous studies have demonstrated applications for texture and radiomic characterization methods for assessing brain tumors to improve noninvasive predictions of tumor histologic characteristics, molecular profile, distinction of treatment-related changes, and prediction of patient survival. In this review, the current use and future potential of texture or radiomic-based approaches with machine learning for brain tumor image analysis and prediction algorithm construction will be discussed. This technology has the potential to advance the value of diagnostic imaging by extracting currently unused information on medical scans that enables more precise, personalized therapy; however, significant barriers must be overcome if this technology is to be successfully implemented on a wide scale for routine use in the clinical setting.

        "Author": "Simon S Martin",
        "Abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the additional value of noninvasive artificial intelligence (AI)-based CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT FFR), derived from triple-rule-out coronary CT angiography for acute chest pain (ACP) in the emergency department (ED) setting. Materials and methods: AI-based CT FFR from triple-rule-out CT angiography data sets was retrospectively obtained in 159 of 271 eligible patients (102 men; mean age, 57.0 years ± 9.7 [standard deviation]) presenting to the ED with ACP. The agreement between CT FFR (≤ 0.80) and stenosis at triple-rule-out CT angiography (≥ 50%), as well as downstream cardiac diagnostic testing, was investigated. Furthermore, the predictive value of CT FFR for coronary revascularization and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was assessed over a 1-year follow-up period. Results: CT FFR and triple-rule-out CT angiography demonstrated agreement in severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in 52% (82 of 159) of all cases. CT FFR of 0.80 and less served as a better predictor for coronary revascularization and MACE than stenosis of 50% and greater at triple-rule-out CT angiography (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.4, 8.2 vs odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval: 0.9, 5.3) (P < .01). In the subgroup of patients with additional noninvasive cardiac testing (94 of 159), there was higher agreement as to the presence or absence of significant disease with CT FFR (55%) than with coronary triple-rule-out CT angiography (47%) (P = .23). Conclusion: CT FFR derived from triple-rule-out CT angiography was a better predictor for coronary revascularization and MACE and showed better agreement with additional diagnostic testing than triple-rule-out CT angiography. Therefore, CT FFR may improve the specificity in identifying patients with ACP with significant CAD in the ED setting and reduce unnecessary downstream testing.© RSNA, 2020See also the commentary by Ihdayhid and Ben Zekry in this issue."

        "Abstract": "Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) has numerous applications in surgical quality assurance. We assessed AI accuracy in evaluating the critical view of safety (CVS) and intraoperative events during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We hypothesized that AI accuracy and intraoperative events are associated with disease severity. Methods: One thousand fifty-one laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos were annotated by AI for disease severity (Parkland Scale), CVS achievement (Strasberg Criteria), and intraoperative events. Surgeons performed focused video review on procedures with ≥1 intraoperative events (n = 335). AI versus surgeon annotation of CVS components and intraoperative events were compared. For all cases (n = 1051), intraoperative-event association with CVS achievement and severity was examined using ordinal logistic regression. Results: Using AI annotation, surgeons reviewed 50 videos/hr. CVS was achieved in ≤10% of cases. Hepatocystic triangle and cystic plate visualization was achieved more often in low-severity cases (P < 0.03). AI-surgeon agreement for all CVS components exceeded 75%, with higher agreement in high-severity cases (P < 0.03). Surgeons agreed with 99% of AI-annotated intraoperative events. AI-annotated intraoperative events were associated with both disease severity and number of CVS components not achieved. Intraoperative events occurred more frequently in high-severity versus low-severity cases (0.98 vs 0.40 events/case, P < 0.001). Conclusions: AI annotation allows for efficient video review and is a promising quality assurance tool. Disease severity may limit its use and surgeon oversight is still required, especially in complex cases. Continued refinement may improve AI applicability and allow for automated assessment."

        "Author": "Daniel Saboe",
        "Abstract": "The overarching hypothesis of this study was that temporal microbial potentiometric sensor (MPS) signal patterns could be used to predict changes in commonly monitored water quality parameters by using artificial intelligence/machine learning tools. To test this hypothesis, the study first examines a proof of concept by correlating between MPS's signals and high algae concentrations in an algal cultivation pond. Then, the study expanded upon these findings and examined if multiple water quality parameters could be predicted in real surface waters, like irrigation canals. Signals generated between the MPS sensors and other water quality sensors maintained by an Arizona utility company, including algae and chlorophyll, were collected in real time at time intervals of 30 min over a period of 9 months. Data from the MPS system and data collected by the utility company were used to train the ML/AI algorithms and compare the predicted with actual water quality parameters and algae concentrations. Based on the composite signal obtained from the MPS, the ML/AI was used to predict the canal surface water's turbidity, conductivity, chlorophyll, and blue-green algae (BGA), dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH, and predicted values were compared to the measured values. Initial testing in the algal cultivation pond revealed a strong linear correlation (R2 = 0.87) between mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and the MPSs' composite signals. The Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) between the predicted values and measured values were <6.5%, except for the DO, which was 10.45%. The results demonstrate the usefulness of MPSs to predict key surface water quality parameters through a single composite signal, when the ML/AI tools are used conjunctively to disaggregate these signal components. The maintenance-free MPS offers a novel and cost-effective approach to monitor numerous water quality parameters at once with relatively high accuracy."

        "Title": "A Novel Use of Artificial Intelligence to Examine Diversity and Hospital Performance",
        "Author": "Michelle S Mathis",
        "Abstract": "Background: The US population is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. Research suggests that cultural diversity within organizations can increase team potency and performance, yet this theory has not been explored in the field of surgery. Furthermore, when surveyed, patients express a desire for their care provider to mirror their own race and ethnicity. In the present study, we hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between a high ranking by the US News and World Report for gastroenterology and gastrointestinal (GI) surgery and greater racial, ethnic, and gender diversity among the physicians and surgeons. Methods: We used the 2019 US News and World Report rankings for best hospitals by specialty to categorize gastroenterology and GI surgery departments into 2 groups: 1-50 and 51-100. Hospital websites of these top 100 were viewed to determine if racial diversity and inclusion were highlighted in the hospitals' core values or mission statements. To determine the rates of diversity within departments, Betaface (Betaface.com) facial analysis software was used to analyze photos taken from the hospitals' websites. This software was able to determine the race, ethnicity, and gender of the care providers. We examined the racial and ethnic makeup of the populations served by these hospitals to see if the gastroenterologists and surgeons adequately represented the state population. We then ran the independent samples t-test to determine if there was a difference in rankings of more diverse departments. Results: Hospitals with gastroenterology and GI surgery departments in the top 50 were more likely to mention diversity on their websites compared with hospitals that ranked from 51-100 (76% versus 56%; P = 0.035). The top 50 hospitals had a statistically significant higher percentage of underrepresented minority GI physicians and surgeons (7.01% versus 4.04%; P < 0.001). In the 31 states where these hospitals were located, there were more African Americans (13% versus 3%; P < 0.001) and Hispanics (12% versus 2%; P < 0.001), while there were fewer Asians (4% versus 21%; P < 0.001) in the population compared with the faculty. Conclusions: We used artificial intelligence software to determine the degree of racial and ethnic diversity in gastroenterology and GI surgery departments across the county. Higher ranking hospitals had a greater degree of diversity of their faculty and were more likely to emphasize diversity in their mission statements. Hospitals stress the importance of having a culturally diverse staff, yet their care providers may not adequately reflect the populations they serve. Further work is needed to prospectively track diversity rates over time and correlate these changes with measurable outcomes."

        "Abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, specifically supervised learning, are widely used in modern real-world applications, which utilize Computational Intelligence (CI) as their core technology, such as autonomous vehicles, assistive robots, and biometric systems. Attacks that cause misclassifications or mispredictions can lead to erroneous decisions resulting in unreliable operations. Designing robust ML with the ability to provide reliable results in the presence of such attacks has become a top priority in the field of adversarial machine learning. An essential characteristic for rapid development of robust ML is an arms race between attack and defense strategists. However, an important prerequisite for the arms race is access to a well-defined system model so that experiments can be repeated by independent researchers. This paper proposes a fine-grained system-driven taxonomy to specify ML applications and adversarial system models in an unambiguous manner such that independent researchers can replicate experiments and escalate the arms race to develop more evolved and robust ML applications. The paper provides taxonomies for: 1) the dataset, 2) the ML architecture, 3) the adversary's knowledge, capability, and goal, 4) adversary's strategy, and 5) the defense response. In addition, the relationships among these models and taxonomies are analyzed by proposing an adversarial machine learning cycle. The provided models and taxonomies are merged to form a comprehensive system-driven taxonomy, which represents the arms race between the ML applications and adversaries in recent years. The taxonomies encode best practices in the field and help evaluate and compare the contributions of research works and reveals gaps in the field."

        "Author": "Guoxing Tang",
        "Abstract": "Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global public health concern. Many inpatients with COVID-19 have shown clinical symptoms related to sepsis, which will aggravate the deterioration of patients' condition. We aim to diagnose Viral Sepsis Caused by SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing laboratory test data of patients with COVID-19 and establish an early predictive model for sepsis risk among patients with COVID-19. Methods: This study retrospectively investigated laboratory test data of 2,453 patients with COVID-19 from electronic health records. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was employed to build four models with different feature subsets of a total of 69 collected indicators. Meanwhile, the explainable Shapley Additive ePlanation (SHAP) method was adopted to interpret predictive results and to analyze the feature importance of risk factors. Findings: The model for classifying COVID-19 viral sepsis with seven coagulation function indicators achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.9213 (95% CI, 89.94-94.31%), sensitivity 97.17% (95% CI, 94.97-98.46%), and specificity 82.05% (95% CI, 77.24-86.06%). The model for identifying COVID-19 coagulation disorders with eight features provided an average of 3.68 (±) 4.60 days in advance for early warning prediction with 0.9298 AUC (95% CI, 86.91-99.04%), 82.22% sensitivity (95% CI, 67.41-91.49%), and 84.00% specificity (95% CI, 63.08-94.75%). Interpretation: We found that an abnormality of the coagulation function was related to the occurrence of sepsis and the other routine laboratory test represented by inflammatory factors had a moderate predictive value on coagulopathy, which indicated that early warning of sepsis in COVID-19 patients could be achieved by our established model to improve the patient's prognosis and to reduce mortality."

We reviewed the literature to evaluate the (cost) effectiveness of the current surveillance strategy. We also reviewed critical strategies and new technologies which could improve dysplasia detection. Recent findings: Adherence to the current EGD surveillance guidelines is suboptimal with high rates of missed dysplasia/EAC. The influence of surveillance on EAC mortality appears modest. Careful cleansing, inspection and sampling of the BE mucosa using high resolution while light and (electronic) chromoendoscopy is critical. Newer sampling techniques coupled with computer aided diagnosis and emerging imaging technologies have shown promise in improving dysplasia detection. Personalized surveillance with risk stratification based on risk factors for progression may be on the horizon. Summary: Current BE surveillance strategy will likely be further refined and optimized by emerging new technologies in tissue sampling, advanced imaging and risk stratification."

        "Abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the use of natural language processing and artificial intelligence to analyze nutritional and sustainability aspects of recipes and food. We present the state-of-the-art and some use cases, followed by a discussion of challenges. Our perspective on addressing these is that while they typically have a technical nature, they nevertheless require an interdisciplinary approach combining natural language processing and artificial intelligence with expert domain knowledge to create practical tools and comprehensive analysis for the food domain."

        "Title": "Perceptions of Artificial Intelligence Among Healthcare Staff: A Qualitative Survey Study",
        "Author": "Simone Castagno",
        "Abstract": "Objectives: The medical community is in agreement that artificial intelligence (AI) will have a radical impact on patient care in the near future. The purpose of this study is to assess the awareness of AI technologies among health professionals and to investigate their perceptions toward AI applications in medicine. Design: A web-based Google Forms survey was distributed via the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust e-newsletter. Setting: Only staff working at the NHS Foundation Trust received an invitation to complete the online questionnaire. Participants: 98 healthcare professionals out of 7,538 (response rate 1.3%; CI 95%; margin of error 9.64%) completed the survey, including medical doctors, nurses, therapists, managers, and others. Primary outcome: To investigate the prior knowledge of health professionals on the subject of AI as well as their attitudes and worries about its current and future applications. Results: 64% of respondents reported never coming across applications of AI in their work and 87% did not know the difference between machine learning and deep learning, although 50% knew at least one of the two terms. Furthermore, only 5% stated using speech recognition or transcription applications on a daily basis, while 63% never utilize them. 80% of participants believed there may be serious privacy issues associated with the use of AI and 40% considered AI to be potentially even more dangerous than nuclear weapons. However, 79% also believed AI could be useful or extremely useful in their field of work and only 10% were worried AI will replace them at their job. Conclusions: Despite agreeing on the usefulness of AI in the medical field, most health professionals lack a full understanding of the principles of AI and are worried about potential consequences of its widespread use in clinical practice. The cooperation of healthcare workers is crucial for the integration of AI into clinical practice and without it the NHS may miss out on an exceptionally rewarding opportunity. This highlights the need for better education and clear regulatory frameworks."

        "Author": "Luca Biggio",
        "Abstract": "Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) systems are some of the main protagonists of the Industry 4.0 revolution. Efficiently detecting whether an industrial component has deviated from its normal operating condition or predicting when a fault will occur are the main challenges these systems aim at addressing. Efficient PHM methods promise to decrease the probability of extreme failure events, thus improving the safety level of industrial machines. Furthermore, they could potentially drastically reduce the often conspicuous costs associated with scheduled maintenance operations. The increasing availability of data and the stunning progress of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques over the last decade represent two strong motivating factors for the development of data-driven PHM systems. On the other hand, the black-box nature of DL models significantly hinders their level of interpretability, de facto limiting their application to real-world scenarios. In this work, we explore the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods and PHM applications. We present a thorough review of existing works both in the contexts of fault diagnosis and fault prognosis, highlighting the benefits and the drawbacks introduced by the adoption of AI techniques. Our goal is to highlight potentially fruitful research directions along with characterizing the main challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize the promises of AI-based PHM systems."

        "Author": "Vaia Rousopoulou",
        "Abstract": "The exploitation of big volumes of data in Industry 4.0 and the increasing development of cognitive systems strongly facilitate the realm of predictive maintenance for real-time decisions and early fault detection in manufacturing and production. Cognitive factories of Industry 4.0 aim to be flexible, adaptive, and reliable, in order to derive an efficient production scheme, handle unforeseen conditions, predict failures, and aid the decision makers. The nature of the data streams available in industrial sites and the lack of annotated reference data or expert labels create the challenge to design augmented and combined data analytics solutions. This paper introduces a cognitive analytics, self- and autonomous-learned system bearing predictive maintenance solutions for Industry 4.0. A complete methodology for real-time anomaly detection on industrial data and its application on injection molding machines are presented in this study. Ensemble prediction models are implemented on the top of supervised and unsupervised learners and build a compound prediction model of historical data utilizing different algorithms' outputs to a common consensus. The generated models are deployed on a real-time monitoring system, detecting faults in real-time incoming data streams. The key strength of the proposed system is the cognitive mechanism which encompasses a real-time self-retraining functionality based on a novel double-oriented evaluation objective, a data-driven and a model-based one. The presented application aims to support maintenance activities from injection molding machines' operators and demonstrate the advances that can be offered by exploiting artificial intelligence capabilities in Industry 4.0."

        "Abstract": "The use of machine learning and other sophisticated models to aid in prediction and decision making has become widely popular across a breadth of disciplines. Within the greater diagnostic radiology, radiation oncology, and medical physics communities promising work is being performed in tissue classification and cancer staging, outcome prediction, automated segmentation, treatment planning, and quality assurance as well as other areas. In this article, machine learning approaches are explored, highlighting specific applications in machine and patient-specific quality assurance (QA). Machine learning can analyze multiple elements of a delivery system on its performance over time including the multileaf collimator (MLC), imaging system, mechanical and dosimetric parameters. Virtual Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) QA can predict passing rates using different measurement techniques, different treatment planning systems, and different treatment delivery machines across multiple institutions. Prediction of QA passing rates and other metrics can have profound implications on the current IMRT process. Here we cover general concepts of machine learning in dosimetry and various methods used in virtual IMRT QA, as well as their clinical applications."

        "Abstract": "This study aims to help people working in the field of AI understand some of the unique issues regarding disabled people and examines the relationship between the terms \"Personalisation\" and \"Classification\" with regard to disability inclusion. Classification using big data struggles to cope with the individual uniqueness of disabled people, and whereas developers tend to design for the majority so ignoring outliers, designing for edge cases would be a more inclusive approach. Other issues that are discussed in the study include personalising mobile technology accessibility settings with interoperable profiles to allow ubiquitous accessibility; the ethics of using genetic data-driven personalisation to ensure babies are not born with disabilities; the importance of including disabled people in decisions to help understand AI implications; the relationship between localisation and personalisation as assistive technologies need localising in terms of language as well as culture; the ways in which AI could be used to create personalised symbols for people who find it difficult to communicate in speech or writing; and whether blind or visually impaired person will be permitted to \"drive\" an autonomous car. This study concludes by suggesting that the relationship between the terms \"Personalisation\" and \"Classification\" with regards to AI and disability inclusion is a very unique one because of the heterogeneity in contrast to the other protected characteristics and so needs unique solutions."

        "Author": "Justine Boulent",
        "Abstract": "Flavescence dorée (FD) is a grapevine disease caused by phytoplasmas and transmitted by leafhoppers that has been spreading in European vineyards despite significant efforts to control it. In this study, we aim to develop a model for the automatic detection of FD-like symptoms (which encompass other grapevine yellows symptoms). The concept is to detect likely FD-affected grapevines so that samples can be removed for FD laboratory identification, followed by uprooting if they test positive, all to be conducted quickly and without omission, thus avoiding further contamination in the fields. Developing FD-like symptoms detection models is not simple, as it requires dealing with the complexity of field conditions and FD symptoms' expression. To address these challenges, we use deep learning, which has already been proven effective in similar contexts. More specifically, we train a Convolutional Neural Network on image patches, and convert it into a Fully Convolutional Network to perform inference. As a result, we obtain a coarse segmentation of the likely FD-affected areas while having only trained a classifier, which is less demanding in terms of annotations. We evaluate the performance of our model trained on a white grape variety, Chardonnay, across five other grape varieties with varying FD symptoms expressions. Of the two largest test datasets, the true positive rate for Chardonnay reaches 98.48% whereas for Ugni-Blanc it drops to 8.3%, underlining the need for a multi-varietal training dataset to capture the diversity of FD symptoms. To obtain more transparent results and to better understand the model's sensitivity, we investigate its behavior using two visualization techniques, Guided Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping and the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection. Such techniques lead to a more comprehensive analysis with greater reliability, which is essential for in-field applications, and more broadly, for all applications impacting humans and the environment."

        "Author": "Ramkumar Hariharan",
        "Abstract": "Providing accurate utilization forecasts is key to maintaining optimal vaccine stocks in any health facility. Current approaches to vaccine utilization forecasting are based on often outdated population census data, and rely on weak, low-dimensional demand forecasting models. Further, these models provide very little insights into factors that influence vaccine utilization. Here, we built a state-of-the-art, machine learning model using novel, temporally and regionally relevant vaccine utilization data. This highly multidimensional machine learning approach accurately predicted bi-weekly vaccine utilization at the individual health facility level. Specifically, we achieved a forecasting fraction error of less than two for about 45% of regional health facilities in both the Tanzania regions analyzed. Our \"random forest regressor\" had an average forecasting fraction error that was almost 18 times less compared to the existing system. Importantly, using our model, we gleaned several key insights into factors underlying utilization forecasts. This work serves as an important starting point to reimagining predictive health systems in the developing world by leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence and big data."

        "Title": "BRAVE-NET: Fully Automated Arterial Brain Vessel Segmentation in Patients With Cerebrovascular Disease",
        "Author": "Adam Hilbert",
        "Abstract": "Introduction: Arterial brain vessel assessment is crucial for the diagnostic process in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques, such as time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) imaging are applied in the clinical routine to depict arteries. They are, however, only visually assessed. Fully automated vessel segmentation integrated into the clinical routine could facilitate the time-critical diagnosis of vessel abnormalities and might facilitate the identification of valuable biomarkers for cerebrovascular events. In the present work, we developed and validated a new deep learning model for vessel segmentation, coined BRAVE-NET, on a large aggregated dataset of patients with cerebrovascular diseases. Methods: BRAVE-NET is a multiscale 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) model developed on a dataset of 264 patients from three different studies enrolling patients with cerebrovascular diseases. A context path, dually capturing high- and low-resolution volumes, and deep supervision were implemented. The BRAVE-NET model was compared to a baseline Unet model and variants with only context paths and deep supervision, respectively. The models were developed and validated using high-quality manual labels as ground truth. Next to precision and recall, the performance was assessed quantitatively by Dice coefficient (DSC); average Hausdorff distance (AVD); 95-percentile Hausdorff distance (95HD); and via visual qualitative rating. Results: The BRAVE-NET performance surpassed the other models for arterial brain vessel segmentation with a DSC = 0.931, AVD = 0.165, and 95HD = 29.153. The BRAVE-NET model was also the most resistant toward false labelings as revealed by the visual analysis. The performance improvement is primarily attributed to the integration of the multiscaling context path into the 3-D Unet and to a lesser extent to the deep supervision architectural component. Discussion: We present a new state-of-the-art of arterial brain vessel segmentation tailored to cerebrovascular pathology. We provide an extensive experimental validation of the model using a large aggregated dataset encompassing a large variability of cerebrovascular disease and an external set of healthy volunteers. The framework provides the technological foundation for improving the clinical workflow and can serve as a biomarker extraction tool in cerebrovascular diseases."

        "Abstract": "The Indian health care system lacks the infrastructure to meet the health care demands of the country. Physician and nurse availability is 30 and 50% below WHO recommendations, respectively, and has led to a steep imbalance between the demand for health care and the infrastructure available to support it. Among other concerns, India still struggles with challenges like undernutrition, with 38% of children under the age of five being underweight. Despite these challenges, technological advancements, mobile phone ubiquity and rising patient awareness offers a huge opportunity for artificial intelligence to enable efficient healthcare delivery, by improved targeting of constrained resources. The Saathealth mobile app provides low-middle income parents of young children nflwith interactive children's health, nutrition and development content in the form of an entertaining video series, a gamified quiz journey and targeted notifications. The app iteratively evolves the user journey based on dynamic data and predictive algorithms, empowering a shift from reactive to proactive care. Saathealth users have registered over 500,000 sessions and over 200 million seconds on-app engagement over a year, comparing favorably with engagement on other digital health interventions in underserved communities. We have used valuable app analytics data and insights from our 45,000 users to build scalable, predictive models that were validated for specific use cases. Using the Random Forest model with heterogeneous data allowed us to predict user churn with a 93% accuracy. Predicting user lifetimes on the mobile app for preliminary insights gave us an RMSE of 25.09 days and an R2 value of 0.91, reflecting closely correlated predictions. These predictive algorithms allow us to incentivize users with optimized offers and omni-channel nudges, to increase engagement with content as well as other targeted online and offline behaviors. The algorithms also optimize the effectiveness of our intervention by augmenting personalized experiences and directing limited health resources toward populations that are most resistant to digital first interventions. These and similar AI powered algorithms will allow us to lengthen and deepen the lifetime relationship with our health consumers, making more of them effective, proactive participants in improving children's health, nutrition and early cognitive development."

        "Author": "Adam Baker",
        "Abstract": "AI virtual assistants have significant potential to alleviate the pressure on overly burdened healthcare systems by enabling patients to self-assess their symptoms and to seek further care when appropriate. For these systems to make a meaningful contribution to healthcare globally, they must be trusted by patients and healthcare professionals alike, and service the needs of patients in diverse regions and segments of the population. We developed an AI virtual assistant which provides patients with triage and diagnostic information. Crucially, the system is based on a generative model, which allows for relatively straightforward re-parameterization to reflect local disease and risk factor burden in diverse regions and population segments. This is an appealing property, particularly when considering the potential of AI systems to improve the provision of healthcare on a global scale in many regions and for both developing and developed countries. We performed a prospective validation study of the accuracy and safety of the AI system and human doctors. Importantly, we assessed the accuracy and safety of both the AI and human doctors independently against identical clinical cases and, unlike previous studies, also accounted for the information gathering process of both agents. Overall, we found that the AI system is able to provide patients with triage and diagnostic information with a level of clinical accuracy and safety comparable to that of human doctors. Through this approach and study, we hope to start building trust in AI-powered systems by directly comparing their performance to human doctors, who do not always agree with each other on the cause of patients' symptoms or the most appropriate triage recommendation."

        "Author": "Xanthe Hunt",
        "Abstract": "Violence against children is a global public health threat of considerable concern. At least half of all children worldwide experience violence every year; globally, the total number of children between the ages of 2 and 17 years who have experienced violence in any given year is one billion. Based on a review of the literature, we argue that there is substantial potential for AI (and associated machine learning and big data), and mHealth approaches to be utilized to prevent and address violence at a large scale. This potential is particularly marked in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), although whether it could translate into effective solutions at scale remains unclear. We discuss possible entry points for Artificial Intelligence (AI), big data, and mHealth approaches to violence prevention, linking these to the World Health Organization's seven INSPIRE strategies. However, such work should be approached with caution. We highlight clear directions for future work in technology-based and technology-enabled violence prevention. We argue that there is a need for good agent-based models at the level of entire cities where and when violence can occur, where local response systems are. Yet, there is a need to develop common, reliable, and valid population- and individual/family-level data on predictors of violence. These indicators could be integrated into routine health or other information systems and become the basis of Al algorithms for violence prevention and response systems. Further, data on individual help-seeking behavior, risk factors for child maltreatment, and other information which could help us to identify the parameters required to understand what happens to cause, and in response to violence, are needed. To respond to ethical issues engendered by these kinds of interventions, there must be concerted, meaningful efforts to develop participatory and user-led work in the AI space, to ensure that the privacy and profiling concerns outlined above are addressed explicitly going forward. Finally, we make the case that developing AI and other technological infrastructure will require substantial investment, particularly in LMIC."

        "Author": "Gregory R Hart",
        "Abstract": "Incidence and mortality rates of endometrial cancer are increasing, leading to increased interest in endometrial cancer risk prediction and stratification to help in screening and prevention. Previous risk models have had moderate success with the area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.68 to 0.77. Here we demonstrate a population-based machine learning model for endometrial cancer screening that achieves a testing AUC of 0.96. We train seven machine learning algorithms based solely on personal health data, without any genomic, imaging, biomarkers, or invasive procedures. The data come from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). We further compare our machine learning model with 15 gynecologic oncologists and primary care physicians in the stratification of endometrial cancer risk for 100 women. We find a random forest model that achieves a testing AUC of 0.96 and a neural network model that achieves a testing AUC of 0.91. We test both models in risk stratification against 15 practicing physicians. Our random forest model is 2.5 times better at identifying above-average risk women with a 2-fold reduction in the false positive rate. Our neural network model is 2 times better at identifying above-average risk women with a 3-fold reduction in the false positive rate. Our machine learning models provide a non-invasive and cost-effective way to identify high-risk sub-populations who may benefit from early screening of endometrial cancer, prior to disease onset. Through statistical biopsy of personal health data, we have identified a new and effective approach for early cancer detection and prevention for individual patients."

        "Author": "Sebastian Bruckert",
        "Abstract": "Increasing quality and performance of artificial intelligence (AI) in general and machine learning (ML) in particular is followed by a wider use of these approaches in everyday life. As part of this development, ML classifiers have also gained more importance for diagnosing diseases within biomedical engineering and medical sciences. However, many of those ubiquitous high-performing ML algorithms reveal a black-box-nature, leading to opaque and incomprehensible systems that complicate human interpretations of single predictions or the whole prediction process. This puts up a serious challenge on human decision makers to develop trust, which is much needed in life-changing decision tasks. This paper is designed to answer the question how expert companion systems for decision support can be designed to be interpretable and therefore transparent and comprehensible for humans. On the other hand, an approach for interactive ML as well as human-in-the-loop-learning is demonstrated in order to integrate human expert knowledge into ML models so that humans and machines act as companions within a critical decision task. We especially address the problem of Semantic Alignment between ML classifiers and its human users as a prerequisite for semantically relevant and useful explanations as well as interactions. Our roadmap paper presents and discusses an interdisciplinary yet integrated Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence (cAI)-transition-framework with regard to the task of medical diagnosis. We explain and integrate relevant concepts and research areas to provide the reader with a hands-on-cookbook for achieving the transition from opaque black-box models to interactive, transparent, comprehensible and trustworthy systems. To make our approach tangible, we present suitable state of the art methods with regard to the medical domain and include a realization concept of our framework. The emphasis is on the concept of Mutual Explanations (ME) that we introduce as a dialog-based, incremental process in order to provide human ML users with trust, but also with stronger participation within the learning process."

        "Abstract": "Increasingly music has been shown to have both physical and mental health benefits including improvements in cardiovascular health, a link to reduction of cases of dementia in elderly populations, and improvements in markers of general mental well-being such as stress reduction. Here, we describe short case studies addressing general mental well-being (anxiety, stress-reduction) through AI-driven music generation. Engaging in active listening and music-making activities (especially for at risk age groups) can be particularly beneficial, and the practice of music therapy has been shown to be helpful in a range of use cases across a wide age range. However, access to music-making can be prohibitive in terms of access to expertize, materials, and cost. Furthermore the use of existing music for functional outcomes (such as targeted improvement in physical and mental health markers suggested above) can be hindered by issues of repetition and subsequent over-familiarity with existing material. In this paper, we describe machine learning approaches which create functional music informed by biophysiological measurement across two case studies, with target emotional states at opposing ends of a Cartesian affective space (a dimensional emotion space with points ranging from descriptors from relaxation, to fear). Galvanic skin response is used as a marker of psychological arousal and as an estimate of emotional state to be used as a control signal in the training of the machine learning algorithm. This algorithm creates a non-linear time series of musical features for sound synthesis \"on-the-fly\", using a perceptually informed musical feature similarity model. We find an interaction between familiarity and perceived emotional response. We also report on subsequent psychometric evaluation of the generated material, and consider how these - and similar techniques - might be useful for a range of functional music generation tasks, for example, in nonlinear sound-tracking such as that found in interactive media or video games."

        "Author": "Niels K Andersen",
        "Abstract": "For people living with an ostomy, development of peristomal skin complications (PSCs) is the most common post-operative challenge. A visual sign of PSCs is discoloration (redness) of the peristomal skin often resulting from leakage of ostomy output under the baseplate. If left unattended, a mild skin condition may progress into a severe disorder; consequently, it is important to monitor discoloration and leakage patterns closely. The Ostomy Skin Tool is current state-of-the-art for evaluation of peristomal skin, but it relies on patients visiting their healthcare professional regularly. To enable close monitoring of peristomal skin over time, an automated strategy not relying on scheduled consultations is required. Several medical fields have implemented automated image analysis based on artificial intelligence, and these deep learning algorithms have become increasingly recognized as a valuable tool in healthcare. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to develop deep learning algorithms which could provide automated, consistent, and objective assessments of changes in peristomal skin discoloration and leakage patterns. A total of 614 peristomal skin images were used for development of the discoloration model, which predicted the area of the discolored peristomal skin with an accuracy of 95% alongside precision and recall scores of 79.6 and 75.0%, respectively. The algorithm predicting leakage patterns was developed based on 954 product images, and leakage area was determined with 98.8% accuracy, 75.0% precision, and 71.5% recall. Combined, these data for the first time demonstrate implementation of artificial intelligence for automated assessment of changes in peristomal skin discoloration and leakage patterns."

        "Author": "Wentao Wang",
        "Abstract": "Purpose: Treatment planning for pancreas stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a difficult and time-consuming task. In this study, we aim to develop a novel deep learning framework to generate clinical-quality plans by direct prediction of fluence maps from patient anatomy using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Materials and Methods: Our proposed framework utilizes two CNNs to predict intensity-modulated radiation therapy fluence maps and generate deliverable plans: (1) Field-dose CNN predicts field-dose distributions in the region of interest using planning images and structure contours; (2) a fluence map CNN predicts the final fluence map per beam using the predicted field dose projected onto the beam's eye view. The predicted fluence maps were subsequently imported into the treatment planning system for leaf sequencing and final dose calculation (model-predicted plans). One hundred patients previously treated with pancreas SBRT were included in this retrospective study, and they were split into 85 training cases and 15 test cases. For each network, 10% of training data were randomly selected for model validation. Nine-beam benchmark plans with standardized target prescription and organ-at-risk constraints were planned by experienced clinical physicists and used as the gold standard to train the model. Model-predicted plans were compared with benchmark plans in terms of dosimetric endpoints, fluence map deliverability, and total monitor units. Results: The average time for fluence-map prediction per patient was 7.1 s. Comparing model-predicted plans with benchmark plans, target mean dose, maximum dose (0.1 cc), and D95% absolute differences in percentages of prescription were 0.1, 3.9, and 2.1%, respectively; organ-at-risk mean dose and maximum dose (0.1 cc) absolute differences were 0.2 and 4.4%, respectively. The predicted plans had fluence map gamma indices (97.69 ± 0.96% vs. 98.14 ± 0.74%) and total monitor units (2,122 ± 281 vs. 2,265 ± 373) that were comparable to the benchmark plans. Conclusions: We develop a novel deep learning framework for pancreas SBRT planning, which predicts a fluence map for each beam and can, therefore, bypass the lengthy inverse optimization process. The proposed framework could potentially change the paradigm of treatment planning by harnessing the power of deep learning to generate clinically deliverable plans in seconds."

        "Abstract": "Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) employs knowledge models that often behave as a black-box to the majority of users and are not designed to improve the skill level of users. In this study, we aim to demonstrate the feasibility that AI can serve as an effective teaching aid to train individuals to develop optimal intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans. Methods and Materials: The training program is composed of a host of training cases and a tutoring system that consists of a front-end visualization module powered by knowledge models and a scoring system. The current tutoring system includes a beam angle prediction model and a dose-volume histogram (DVH) prediction model. The scoring system consists of physician chosen criteria for clinical plan evaluation as well as specially designed criteria for learning guidance. The training program includes six lung/mediastinum IMRT patients: one benchmark case and five training cases. A plan for the benchmark case is completed by each trainee entirely independently pre- and post-training. Five training cases cover a wide spectrum of complexity from easy (2), intermediate (1) to hard (2). Five trainees completed the training program with the help of one trainer. Plans designed by the trainees were evaluated by both the scoring system and a radiation oncologist to quantify planning quality. Results: For the benchmark case, trainees scored an average of 21.6% of the total max points pre-training and improved to an average of 51.8% post-training. In comparison, the benchmark case's clinical plans score an average of 54.1% of the total max points. Two of the five trainees' post-training plans on the benchmark case were rated as comparable to the clinically delivered plans by the physician and all five were noticeably improved by the physician's standards. The total training time for each trainee ranged between 9 and 12 h. Conclusion: This first attempt at a knowledge model based training program brought unexperienced planners to a level close to experienced planners in fewer than 2 days. The proposed tutoring system can serve as an important component in an AI ecosystem that will enable clinical practitioners to effectively and confidently use KBP."

        "Author": "Arash Keshavarzi Arshadi",
        "Abstract": "SARS-COV-2 has roused the scientific community with a call to action to combat the growing pandemic. At the time of this writing, there are as yet no novel antiviral agents or approved vaccines available for deployment as a frontline defense. Understanding the pathobiology of COVID-19 could aid scientists in their discovery of potent antivirals by elucidating unexplored viral pathways. One method for accomplishing this is the leveraging of computational methods to discover new candidate drugs and vaccines in silico. In the last decade, machine learning-based models, trained on specific biomolecules, have offered inexpensive and rapid implementation methods for the discovery of effective viral therapies. Given a target biomolecule, these models are capable of predicting inhibitor candidates in a structural-based manner. If enough data are presented to a model, it can aid the search for a drug or vaccine candidate by identifying patterns within the data. In this review, we focus on the recent advances of COVID-19 drug and vaccine development using artificial intelligence and the potential of intelligent training for the discovery of COVID-19 therapeutics. To facilitate applications of deep learning for SARS-COV-2, we highlight multiple molecular targets of COVID-19, inhibition of which may increase patient survival. Moreover, we present CoronaDB-AI, a dataset of compounds, peptides, and epitopes discovered either in silico or in vitro that can be potentially used for training models in order to extract COVID-19 treatment. The information and datasets provided in this review can be used to train deep learning-based models and accelerate the discovery of effective viral therapies."

        "Author": "Rodrigo F Cádiz",
        "Abstract": "Fuzzy logic is an artificial intelligence technique that has applications in many areas, due to its importance in handling uncertain inputs. Despite the great recent success of other branches of AI, such as deep neural networks, fuzzy logic is still a very powerful machine learning technique, based on expert reasoning, that can be of help in many areas of musical creativity, such as composing music, synthesizing sounds, gestural mappings in electronic instruments, parametric control of sound synthesis, audiovisual content generation or sonification. We propose that fuzzy logic is a very suitable framework for thinking and operating not only with sound and acoustic signals but also with symbolic representations of music. In this article, we discuss the application of fuzzy logic ideas to music, introduce the Fuzzy Logic Control Toolkit, a set of tools to use fuzzy logic inside the MaxMSP real-time sound synthesis environment, and show how some fuzzy logic concepts can be used and incorporated into fields, such as algorithmic composition, sound synthesis and parametric control of computer music. Finally, we discuss the composition of Incerta, an acousmatic multichannel composition as a concrete example of the application of fuzzy concepts to musical creation."

        "Author": "Mingxi Cheng",
        "Abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a fundamental role in the modern world, especially when used as an autonomous decision maker. One common concern nowadays is \"how trustworthy the AIs are.\" Human operators follow a strict educational curriculum and performance assessment that could be exploited to quantify how much we entrust them. To quantify the trust of AI decision makers, we must go beyond task accuracy especially when facing limited, incomplete, misleading, controversial or noisy datasets. Toward addressing these challenges, we describe DeepTrust, a Subjective Logic (SL) inspired framework that constructs a probabilistic logic description of an AI algorithm and takes into account the trustworthiness of both dataset and inner algorithmic workings. DeepTrust identifies proper multi-layered neural network (NN) topologies that have high projected trust probabilities, even when trained with untrusted data. We show that uncertain opinion of data is not always malicious while evaluating NN's opinion and trustworthiness, whereas the disbelief opinion hurts trust the most. Also trust probability does not necessarily correlate with accuracy. DeepTrust also provides a projected trust probability of NN's prediction, which is useful when the NN generates an over-confident output under problematic datasets. These findings open new analytical avenues for designing and improving the NN topology by optimizing opinion and trustworthiness, along with accuracy, in a multi-objective optimization formulation, subject to space and time constraints."

        "Author": "Erica L Troncoso",
        "Abstract": "The global vision for primary health care (PHC) is defined by regular access to quality care for comprehensive services throughout the course of life. However, this is not what typically happens, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where many people access the formal health system only for emergent needs. Yet, even episodic care is nearly impossible to attain due to infrastructure barriers, critical shortages of health care providers, and low-quality care. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) can help us revolutionize the current reality of health care into the vision of continuous health care that promotes individuals to maintain a constant healthy state. AI/ML can deliver precise recommendations to the individual, transforming patients from a passive receiver of health services into an active participant of their own care. By accounting for each individual, AI/ML can also ensure equitable coverage for entire populations with an ongoing data exchange between personal health, genomic data, public health, and environmental factors. The greatest challenge to enlisting AI/ML in the quest toward the PHC vision will be instilling a sense of responsibility with global citizens to recognize health data for the global good while prioritizing protected, individually owned data sets. Only when individuals start taking a collective approach to health data, shifting the mindset toward the goal of prevention, will the potential of AI/ML for PHC be realized. Until we overcome this challenge, the paradigm shift of the global community away from our ad hoc, reactive health system culture will not be achieved."

        "Abstract": "As the Covid-19 pandemic surges around the world, questions arise about the number of global cases at the pandemic's peak, the length of the pandemic before receding, and the timing of intervention strategies to significantly stop the spread of Covid-19. We have developed artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired methods for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics and evaluating interventions to curb the spread and impact of COVID-19. The developed methods were applied to the surveillance data of cumulative and new COVID-19 cases and deaths reported by WHO as of March 16th, 2020. Both the timing and the degree of intervention were evaluated. The average error of five-step ahead forecasting was 2.5%. The total peak number of cumulative cases, new cases, and the maximum number of cumulative cases in the world with complete intervention implemented 4 weeks later than the beginning date (March 16th, 2020) reached 75,249,909, 10,086,085, and 255,392,154, respectively. However, the total peak number of cumulative cases, new cases, and the maximum number of cumulative cases in the world with complete intervention after 1 week were reduced to 951,799, 108,853 and 1,530,276, respectively. Duration time of the COVID-19 spread was reduced from 356 days to 232 days between later and earlier interventions. We observed that delaying intervention for 1 month caused the maximum number of cumulative cases reduce by -166.89 times that of earlier complete intervention, and the number of deaths increased from 53,560 to 8,938,725. Earlier and complete intervention is necessary to stem the tide of COVID-19 infection."

        "Author": "Brian M de Silva",
        "Abstract": "Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are now being used to automate the discovery of physics principles and governing equations from measurement data alone. However, positing a universal physical law from data is challenging without simultaneously proposing an accompanying discrepancy model to account for the inevitable mismatch between theory and measurements. By revisiting the classic problem of modeling falling objects of different size and mass, we highlight a number of nuanced issues that must be addressed by modern data-driven methods for automated physics discovery. Specifically, we show that measurement noise and complex secondary physical mechanisms, like unsteady fluid drag forces, can obscure the underlying law of gravitation, leading to an erroneous model. We use the sparse identification of non-linear dynamics (SINDy) method to identify governing equations for real-world measurement data and simulated trajectories. Incorporating into SINDy the assumption that each falling object is governed by a similar physical law is shown to improve the robustness of the learned models, but discrepancies between the predictions and observations persist due to subtleties in drag dynamics. This work highlights the fact that the naive application of ML/AI will generally be insufficient to infer universal physical laws without further modification."

        "Author": "Jaya Krishna Mandivarapu",
        "Abstract": "Learning a set of tasks over time, also known as continual learning (CL), is one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence. While recent approaches achieve some degree of CL in deep neural networks, they either (1) store a new network (or an equivalent number of parameters) for each new task, (2) store training data from previous tasks, or (3) restrict the network's ability to learn new tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, Self-Net, that uses an autoencoder to learn a set of low-dimensional representations of the weights learned for different tasks. We demonstrate that these low-dimensional vectors can then be used to generate high-fidelity recollections of the original weights. Self-Net can incorporate new tasks over time with little retraining, minimal loss in performance for older tasks, and without storing prior training data. We show that our technique achieves over 10X storage compression in a continual fashion, and that it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on numerous datasets, including continual versions of MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Atari, and task-incremental CORe50. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use autoencoders to sequentially encode sets of network weights to enable continual learning."

        "Abstract": "Computational Creativity is a multidisciplinary field that tries to obtain creative behaviors from computers. One of its most prolific subfields is that of Music Generation (also called Algorithmic Composition or Musical Metacreation), that uses computational means to compose music. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of this research field, it is sometimes hard to define precise goals and to keep track of what problems can be considered solved by state-of-the-art systems and what instead needs further developments. With this survey, we try to give a complete introduction to those who wish to explore Computational Creativity and Music Generation. To do so, we first give a picture of the research on the definition and the evaluation of creativity, both human and computational, needed to understand how computational means can be used to obtain creative behaviors and its importance within Artificial Intelligence studies. We then review the state of the art of Music Generation Systems, by citing examples for all the main approaches to music generation, and by listing the open challenges that were identified by previous reviews on the subject. For each of these challenges, we cite works that have proposed solutions, describing what still needs to be done and some possible directions for further research."

        "Abstract": "Deep learning models stand for a new learning paradigm in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Recent breakthrough results in image analysis and speech recognition have generated a massive interest in this field because also applications in many other domains providing big data seem possible. On a downside, the mathematical and computational methodology underlying deep learning models is very challenging, especially for interdisciplinary scientists. For this reason, we present in this paper an introductory review of deep learning approaches including Deep Feedforward Neural Networks (D-FFNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Autoencoders (AEs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These models form the major core architectures of deep learning models currently used and should belong in any data scientist's toolbox. Importantly, those core architectural building blocks can be composed flexibly-in an almost Lego-like manner-to build new application-specific network architectures. Hence, a basic understanding of these network architectures is important to be prepared for future developments in AI."

Applications include evaluation of skin images for screening and diagnosis as well as clinical management including treatment and complication prediction. Objective: To summarize literature on ML applications to psoriasis evaluation and management and to discuss challenges and opportunities for future advances. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore for peer-reviewed publications published in English through December 1, 2019. Our search queries identified publications with any of the 10 computing-related keywords and \"psoriasis\" in the title and/or abstract. Results: Thirty-three studies were identified. Articles were organized by topic and synthesized as evaluation- or management-focused articles covering 5 content categories: (A) Evaluation using skin images: (1) identification and differential diagnosis of psoriasis lesions, (2) lesion segmentation, and (3) lesion severity and area scoring; (B) clinical management: (1) prediction of complications and (2) treatment. Conclusion: Machine learning has significant potential to aid psoriasis evaluation and management. Current topics popular in ML research on psoriasis are the evaluation of medical images, prediction of complications, and treatment discovery. For patients to derive the greatest benefit from ML advancements, it is helpful for dermatologists to have an understanding of ML and how it can effectively aid their assessments and decision-making."

        "Abstract": "Introduction: Diagnosing renal pathologies is important for performing treatments. However, classifying every glomerulus is difficult for clinicians; thus, a support system, such as a computer, is required. This paper describes the automatic classification of glomerular images using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Method: To generate appropriate labeled data, annotation criteria including 12 features (e.g., \"fibrous crescent\") were defined. The concordance among 5 clinicians was evaluated for 100 images using the kappa (κ) coefficient for each feature. Using the annotation criteria, 1 clinician annotated 10,102 images. We trained the CNNs to classify the features with an average κ ≥0.4 and evaluated their performance using the receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC). An error analysis was conducted and the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was also applied; it expresses the CNN's focusing point with a heat map when the CNN classifies the glomerular image for a feature. Results: The average κ coefficient of the features ranged from 0.28 to 0.50. The ROC-AUC of the CNNs for test data varied from 0.65 to 0.98. Among the features, \"capillary collapse\" and \"fibrous crescent\" had high ROC-AUC values of 0.98 and 0.91, respectively. The error analysis and the Grad-CAM visually showed that the CNN could not distinguish between 2 different features that had similar visual structures or that occurred simultaneously. Conclusion: The differences in the texture or frequency of the co-occurrence between the different features affected the CNN performance; thus, to improve the classification accuracy, methods such as segmentation are required."

        "Author": "Matthew J Dellinger",
        "Abstract": "It is well documented that fish consumption imparts both health risks and benefits. Furthermore, fish harvest and consumption are an essential part of Great Lakes Native American cultures. Quantitative models that compare risk and benefits to potential consumption scenarios can help guide future health research as well as consumption advice for potentially sensitive populations. This article presents fish consumption scenarios based on self-reported meal plans constructed by tribal members in eastern upper peninsula and northern lower Michigan Anishinaabe. Two risk-benefit models were applied to these scenarios to estimate the potential neurodevelopmental and cardiovascular risks (either increased or reduced risk) from dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs), methylmercury (MeHg), and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFA). All scenarios except maximum exposure estimates (i.e. 25th-75th percentile MeHg, DL-PCB, and n3-PUFA intakes) predicted reduced cardiovascular risk and improved neurodevelopmental outcomes. The greatest predicted benefits (adjusted for risks) occurred at the 75th percentile intake of MeHg, DL-PCB, and n3-PUFA scenarios: 5.0 visual recall memory (VRM) and 4.41 Intelligence Quotient (IQ) benefits, and 28% reduced risk of cardio-vascular disease. Scenarios based on maximum self-reported intake, however, predicted health detriments. These results suggest that most fish consumption scenarios as constructed in collaboration with Native American communities could impart health benefits despite the presence of contaminants. However, high-end consumption estimates warrant caution as well as the need for well-crafted advice. Potential benefits further underscore the value of reducing contamination burdens in Great Lakes fisheries. Future priorities of ongoing contamination monitoring and health research are discussed."

Methods: This is an observational and cross-sectional study to evaluate the presence of burnout in HCWs in academic tertiary care centres of North India in the COVID-19 era. At least 900 participants will be enrolled in this study from four leading premier government-funded/public-private centres of North India. Each study centre will be asked to recruit HCWs by approaching them through various listed ways for participation in the study. Interested participants after initial screening and meeting the eligibility criteria, will be asked to fill the questionnaire (having demographic and work related with Mini Z questionnaire) to assess burnout. The healthcare workers will include physicians at all levels of training, nursing staff and paramedical staff who are involved directly or indirectly in COVID-19 care. The analysis of the raw electrocardiogram (ECG) data and development of algorithm using convolutional neural networks (CNN) will be done by experts.

When a revolution happens, the consequences are not obvious straight away, and to date, there is no uniformly adapted framework to guide AI research to ensure a sustainable societal transition. To answer this need, here we analyze three key challenges to interdisciplinary AI research, and deliver three broad conclusions: 1) future development of AI should not only impact other scientific domains but should also take inspiration and benefit from other fields of science, 2) AI research must be accompanied by decision explainability, dataset bias transparency as well as development of evaluation methodologies and creation of regulatory agencies to ensure responsibility, and 3) AI education should receive more attention, efforts and innovation from the educational and scientific communities. Our analysis is of interest not only to AI practitioners but also to other researchers and the general public as it offers ways to guide the emerging collaborations and interactions toward the most fruitful outcomes."

        "Abstract": "Purpose: Our work introduces a highly accurate, safe, and sufficiently explicable machine-learning (artificial intelligence) model of intraocular lens power (IOL) translating into better post-surgical outcomes for patients with cataracts. We also demonstrate its improved predictive accuracy over previous formulas. Methods: We collected retrospective eye measurement data on 5,331 eyes from 3,276 patients across multiple centers who received a lens implantation during cataract surgery. The dependent measure is the post-operative manifest spherical equivalent error from intended and the independent variables are the patient- and eye-specific characteristics. This dataset was split so that one subset was for formula construction and the other for validating our new formula. Data excluded fellow eyes, so as not to confound the prediction with bilateral eyes. Results: Our formula is three times more precise than reported studies with a median absolute IOL error of 0.204 diopters (D). When converted to absolute predictive refraction errors on the cornea, the median error is 0.137 D which is close to the IOL manufacturer tolerance. These estimates are validated out-of-sample and thus are expected to reflect the future performance of our prediction formula, especially since our data were collected from a wide variety of patients, clinics, and manufacturers. Conclusion: The increased precision of IOL power calculations has the potential to optimize patient positive refractive outcomes. Our model also provides uncertainty plots that can be used in tandem with the clinician's expertise and previous formula output, further enhancing the safety. Translational relavance: Our new machine learning process has the potential to significantly improve patient IOL refractive outcomes safely."

        "Abstract": "Centralized biodiversity data aggregation is too often failing societal needs due to pervasive and systemic data quality deficiencies. We argue for a novel approach that embodies the spirit of the Web (\"small pieces loosely joined\") through the decentralized coordination of data across scientific languages and communities. The upfront cost of decentralization can be offset by the long-term benefit of achieving sustained expert engagement, higher-quality data products, and ultimately more societal impact for biodiversity data. Our decentralized approach encourages the emergence and evolution of multiple self-identifying communities of practice that are regionally, taxonomically, or institutionally localized. Each community is empowered to control the social and informational design and versioning of their local data infrastructures and signals. With no single aggregator to exert centralized control over biodiversity data, decentralization generates loosely connected networks of mid-level aggregators. Global coordination is nevertheless feasible through automatable data sharing agreements that enable efficient propagation and translation of biodiversity data across communities. The decentralized model also poses novel integration challenges, among which the explicit and continuous articulation of conflicting systematic classifications and phylogenies remain the most challenging. We discuss the development of available solutions, challenges, and outline next steps: the global effort of coordination should focus on developing shared languages for data signal translation, as opposed to homogenizing the data signal itself."

Research suggests that centralized approaches result in poor representation, and as AI is now integrated more in daily life, there is a need for efforts to improve on this. The AI research community has begun to explore managing data infrastructures more democratically, finding that decentralized networking allows for more transparency which can alleviate core ethical concerns, such as selection-bias. With this in mind, herein, we present a mini-survey framed around data representation and data infrastructures in AI. We outline four key considerations (auditing, benchmarking, confidence and trust, explainability and interpretability) as they pertain to data-driven AI, and propose that reflection of them, along with improved interdisciplinary discussion may aid the mitigation of data-based AI ethical concerns, and ultimately improve individual wellbeing when interacting with AI."

        "Abstract": "This article deals with the IT security of connectionist artificial intelligence (AI) applications, focusing on threats to integrity, one of the three IT security goals. Such threats are for instance most relevant in prominent AI computer vision applications. In order to present a holistic view on the IT security goal integrity, many additional aspects, such as interpretability, robustness and documentation are taken into account. A comprehensive list of threats and possible mitigations is presented by reviewing the state-of-the-art literature. AI-specific vulnerabilities, such as adversarial attacks and poisoning attacks are discussed in detail, together with key factors underlying them. Additionally and in contrast to former reviews, the whole AI life cycle is analyzed with respect to vulnerabilities, including the planning, data acquisition, training, evaluation and operation phases. The discussion of mitigations is likewise not restricted to the level of the AI system itself but rather advocates viewing AI systems in the context of their life cycles and their embeddings in larger IT infrastructures and hardware devices. Based on this and the observation that adaptive attackers may circumvent any single published AI-specific defense to date, the article concludes that single protective measures are not sufficient but rather multiple measures on different levels have to be combined to achieve a minimum level of IT security for AI applications."

Thus, prediction and on-time treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are of great importance for improving and maintaining patients' quality of life and avoiding the consequent socio-economical burden of amputation. In this study, we use Danish national registry data to understand the risk factors of developing diabetic foot ulcers and amputation among patients with diabetes. We analyze the data of 246,705 patients with diabetes to assess some of the main risk factors for developing DFU/amputation. We study the socioeconomic information and past medical history of the patients. Factors, such as low family disposable income, cardiovascular disorders, peripheral artery, neuropathy, and chronic renal complications are among the important risk factors. Mental disorders and depression, albeit not as pronounced, still pose higher risks in comparison to the group of people without these complications. We further use machine learning techniques to assess the practical usefulness of such risk factors for predicting foot ulcers and amputation. Finally, we outline the limitations of working with registry data sources and explain potentials for combining additional public and private data sources in future applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the prediction of diabetic foot ulcers and amputation."

        "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate whether a radiomics model can help to improve the performance of PI-RADS v2.1 in prostate cancer (PCa). Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 203 patients with pathologically confirmed PCa or non-PCa between March 2015 and December 2016. Patients were divided into a training set (n = 141) and a validation set (n = 62). The radiomics model (Rad-score) was developed based on multi-parametric MRI including T2 weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) imaging, and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) imaging. The combined model involving Rad-score and PI-RADS was compared with PI-RADS for the diagnosis of PCa by using the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. Results: A total of 112 (55.2%) patients had PCa, and 91 (44.8%) patients had benign lesions. For PCa versus non-PCa, the Rad-score had a significantly higher area under the ROC curve (AUC) [0.979 (95% CI, 0.940-0.996)] than PI-RADS [0.905 (0.844-0.948), P = 0.002] in the training set. However, the AUC between them was insignificant in the validation set [0.861 (0.749-0.936) vs. 0.845 (0.731-0.924), P = 0.825]. When Rad-score was added to PI-RADS, the performance of the PI-RADS was significantly improved for the PCa diagnosis (AUC = 0.989, P < 0.001 for the training set and AUC = 0.931, P = 0.038 for the validation set). Conclusions: The radiomics based on multi-parametric MRI can help to improve the diagnostic performance of PI-RADS v2.1 in PCa."

        "Author": "Wenjie Qu",
        "Abstract": "Background: The aim was to develop a personalized survival prediction deep learning model for adenosarcoma patients using the surveillance, epidemiology and end results (SEER) database. Methods: A total of 797 uterine adenosarcoma patients were enrolled in this study. Duplicated and useless variables were excluded, and 15 variables were selected for further analyses, including age, grade, positive lymph nodes or not, marital status, race, tumor extension, stage, and surgery or not. We created our deep survival learning (DSL) model to manipulate the data, which was randomly split into a training set (n = 519, 65%), validation set (n = 143, 18%) and testing set (n = 143, 18%). The Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model was also included comparatively. Finally, personalized survival curves were plotted for randomly selected patients. Results: The c-index for the CPH model was 0.726, and the Brier score was 0.17. For our deep survival learning model, we achieved a c-index of 0.774 and a Brier score of 0.14 in the external testing set. In addition, the limitations of the traditional staging system were revealed, and a personalized survival prediction system based on our risk scoring grouping was developed. Conclusions: Our study developed a deep neural network model for adenosarcoma. The performance of this model was superior to that of the traditional Cox proportional hazard model. In addition, a personalized survival prediction system was developed based on our deep survival learning model, which provided more accurate prognostic information for adenosarcoma patients."

        "Title": "Executive function in individuals with clinically significant weight loss via behavioral intervention",
        "Author": "Marissa A Gowey",
        "Abstract": "Background: Executive function (EF) is associated with obesity development and self-management. Individuals who demonstrate or self-report poorer EF performance tend to have poorer short-term outcomes in obesity treatment. There may be distinct behavioral self-management strategies and EF domains related to initial weight loss as compared to weight loss maintenance. Objective: To characterize EF in individuals who achieved clinically significant weight loss via behavioral intervention and examine potential differences in EF between those who maintained versus regained lost weight. Methods: Participants who previously achieved ≥5% weight loss via lifestyle intervention were included (N = 44). \"Maintainers\" (n = 16) maintained this minimum level of weight loss for ≥1 year. \"Regainers\" (n = 28) regained some or all initially lost weight. Performance-based EF, intelligence quotient, health literacy, depression, anxiety, binge eating, demographics, and medical/weight history were assessed using a cross-sectional design. Descriptive statistics and age-, gender-, education-adjusted reference ranges were used to characterize EF. Analyses of covariance were conducted to examine EF differences between maintainers and regainers. Results: The sample consisted primarily of females with obesity over age 50. Approximately half self-identified as African-American. Decision-making performance was better in maintainers than regainers (p = 0.003, partη2 = 0.19). There were no differences between maintainers and regainers in inhibitory control, verbal fluency, planning/organization, cognitive flexibility, or working memory (ps > 0.05, partη2s = 0.003-0.07). At least 75% of the sample demonstrated average-above average EF test performance, indicated by scaled scores ≥13 or t-scores > 60. Conclusions: Most individuals with obesity who achieved clinically significant weight loss via behavioral intervention had average to above average EF. Individuals who maintained (vs. regained) their lost weight performed better on tests of decision-making."

        "Author": "Denis Bratko",
        "Abstract": "The goal of this study was to explore the raters' agreement and the effect of raters' and targets' gender on self- and parental intelligence assessments in the sample of Croatian twins. Twins were asked to assess their own and their parents' overall intelligence, as well as specific abilities from the Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences. Data was analysed to explore: i) twins' agreement in parental assessments and behavioural genetic analysis of the overall intelligence estimates; ii) gender differences in self- assessments; and iii) raters' and targets' gender effects on parental assessments. The twins' mean correlation in their assessments of overall parental intelligence was .60. The differences between monozygotic and dizygotic twin correlations were nonsignificant for all of the estimated abilities, and model fitting analysis indicates that hypothesis about genetic effect on parental assessment of intelligence should be rejected. The hypotheses about males' higher self-assessments for overall intelligence and for the masculine types of abilities - logical-mathematical, body-kinesthetic and spatial abilities - were confirmed. For the feminine types of abilities - verbal/linguistic, inter- and intra- personal intelligences - there were no significant gender effects. Both target and rater effect were found for the parental estimates of intelligence. Fathers were estimated higher on overall intelligence, logical-mathematical, body-kinesthetic and spatial abilities, while mothers were estimated higher on interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence. The effect of the raters' gender was found for overall intelligence as well as for inter- and intra- personal intelligences, where males gave higher estimates of parental intelligences than females."

        "Title": "Immune Deregulation in Sepsis and Septic Shock: Reversing Immune Paralysis by Targeting PD-1/PD-L1 Pathway",
        "Author": "Yuki Nakamori",
        "Abstract": "Sepsis remains a major problem for human health worldwide, thereby manifesting high rates of morbidity and mortality. Sepsis, once understood as a monophasic sustained hyperinflammation, is currently recognized as a dysregulated host response to infection, with both hyperinflammation and immunoparalysis occurring simultaneously from the earliest stages of sepsis, involving multiple organ dysfunctions. Despite the recent progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology underlying sepsis, no specific treatment to restore immune dysregulation in sepsis has been validated in clinical trials. In recent years, treatment for immune checkpoints such as the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death ligand (PD-1/PD-L) pathway in tumor-infiltrating T-lymphocytes has been successful in the field of cancer immune therapy. As immune-paralysis in sepsis involves exhausted T-lymphocytes, future clinical applications of checkpoint inhibitors for sepsis are expected. In addition, the functions of PD-1/PD-L on innate lymphoid cells and the role of exosomal forms of PD-L1 warrant further research. Looking back on the history of repeatedly failed clinical trials of immune modulatory therapies for sepsis, sepsis must be recognized as a difficult disease entity for performing clinical trials. A major obstacle that could prevent effective clinical trials of drug candidates is the disease complexity and heterogeneities; clinically diagnosed sepsis could contain multiple sepsis subgroups that suffer different levels of hyper-inflammation and immune-suppression in distinct organs. Thus, the selection of appropriate more homogenous sepsis subgroup is the key for testing the clinical efficacy of experimental therapies targeting specific pathways in either hyperinflammation and/or immunoparalysis. An emerging technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) may help to identify an immune paralysis subgroup who would best be treated by PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitors."

        "Author": "Nathan Brooks",
        "Abstract": "Much contention and speculation exists regarding the emotional and social skills associated with psychopathic personality, including the idea of a predatory perception. The current study examined the relationship between psychopathic personality and social and emotional processing. The study utilised a quasi-experimental design along with self-report measures to examine psychopathy in a community sample (N = 115) of males and females. To examine psychopathy and social information processing, a series of Mixed Design ANOVA's were conducted to examine the effect of psychopathy on character recall. Psychopathy was found to significantly predict recall of the unsuccessful character, however, did not predict recall of character gender or emotion. Two hierarchical regressions analyses were conducted to examine emotional intelligence and empathy. Psychopathy was found to be a significant negative predictor of empathy, however, did not significantly predict emotional intelligence. Implications for the current study lie within advancing the empirical understanding on psychopathic personality and victim vulnerability."

        "Author": "Jordan Nunan",
        "Abstract": "Rapport is an integral part of interviewing, viewed as fundamental to the success of intelligence elicitation. One collection capability is human intelligence (HUMINT), the discipline charged with eliciting intelligence through interactions with human sources, such as covert human intelligence sources (CHIS). To date, research has yet to explore the perceptions and experiences of intelligence operatives responsible for gathering HUMINT within England and Wales. The present study consisted of structured interviews with police source handlers (N = 24). Rapport was perceived as essential, especially for maximising the opportunity for intelligence elicitation. Participants provided a range of rapport strategies while highlighting the importance of establishing, and maintaining, rapport. The majority of participants believed rapport could be trained to some degree. Thus, rapport was not viewed exclusively as a natural skill. However, participants commonly perceived some natural attributes are required to build rapport that can be refined and developed through training and experience."

        "Abstract": "Identification is a primary need of societies. It is even more central in law enforcement. In the history of crime, a dialectics takes place between felonious attempts at concealing, disguising, or forging identities and societal efforts at unmasking the impostures. Semiotics offers specialistic skills at studying the signs of societal detection and identification, including those of forensics and criminology. In human history, no sign more than the face is attached a value of personal identity. Yet, modern forensics realizes that the face can mislead and, inspired by eastern models (China, Japan, India), adopts fingerprinting. In the digital era, however, fingerprinting first goes digital, then it is increasingly replaced by facial recognition. The face is back in digital AI forensics, together with a tangle of sociocultural biases. Semiotics can play a key role in studying their surreptitious influence."

        "Author": "Adrianna Ratajska",
        "Abstract": "In 1944, Heider and Simmel reported that observers could perceive simple animated geometric shapes as characters with emotions, intentions, and other social attributes. This work has been cited over 3000 times and has had wide and ongoing influence on the study of social cognition and social intelligence. However, many researchers in this area have continued to use the original Heider and Simmel black-and-white video. We asked whether the original findings could be reproduced 75 years later by creating 32 new colored animated shape videos designed to depict various social plots and testing whether they can evoke similar spontaneous social attributions. Participants (N = 66) viewed our videos and were asked to write narratives which we coded for indicia of different types of social attributions. Consistent with Heider and Simmel, we found that participants spontaneously attributed social meaning to the videos. We observed that responses to our videos were also similar to responses to the original video reported by Klin (2000), despite being only 13-23 s and portraying a broader range of social plots. Participants varied in how many social attributions they made in response, and the videos varied in how much they elicited such responses. Our set of animated shape videos is freely available online for all researchers to use and forms the basis of a multiple-choice assessment of social intelligence (Brown et al., 2019)."

        "Author": "Leon Hubbard",
        "Abstract": "Background: Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is a major contributor to poor outcomes, yet its causes are poorly understood. Some rare copy number variants (CNVs) are associated with schizophrenia risk and affect cognition in healthy populations, but their contribution to cognitive impairment in schizophrenia has not been investigated. We examined the effect of 12 schizophrenia CNVs on cognition in those with schizophrenia. Methods: General cognitive ability was measured using the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia composite z score in 875 patients with schizophrenia and in a replication sample of 519 patients with schizophrenia using Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Full Scale IQ. Using linear regression, we tested for association between cognition and schizophrenia CNV status, covarying for age and sex. In addition, we tested whether CNVs hitting genes in schizophrenia-enriched gene sets (loss-of-function intolerant and synaptic gene sets) were associated with cognitive impairment. Results: A total of 23 schizophrenia CNV carriers were identified. Schizophrenia CNV carriers had lower general cognitive ability than nonschizophrenia CNV carriers in discovery (β = -0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.31 to -0.01) and replication samples (β = -0.91, 95% CI = -1.71 to -0.11) and after meta-analysis (β = -0.76, 95% CI = -1.26 to -0.25, p = .003). CNVs hitting loss-of-function intolerant genes were associated with lower cognition (β = -0.15, 95% CI = -0.29 to -0.001, p = .048). Conclusions: In those with schizophrenia, cognitive ability in schizophrenia CNV carriers is 0.5-1.0 standard deviations below non-CNV carriers, which may have implications for clinical assessment and management. We also demonstrate that rare CNVs hitting genes intolerant to loss-of-function variation lead to more severe cognitive impairment, above and beyond the effect of known schizophrenia CNVs."

        "Abstract": "Background: This study aims to construct and validate a model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can fulfil the automatic segmentation of clinical target volumes (CTVs) of breast cancer for radiotherapy. Methods: In this work, computed tomography (CT) scans of 110 patients who underwent modified radical mastectomies were collected. The CTV contours were confirmed by two experienced oncologists. A novel CNN was constructed to automatically delineate the CTV. Quantitative evaluation metrics were calculated, and a clinical evaluation was conducted to evaluate the performance of our model. Results: The mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of the proposed model was 0.90, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (95HD) was 5.65 mm. The evaluation results of the two clinicians showed that 99.3% of the chest wall CTV slices could be accepted by clinician A, and this number was 98.9% for clinician B. In addition, 9/10 of patients had all slices accepted by clinician A, while 7/10 could be accepted by clinician B. The score differences between the AI (artificial intelligence) group and the GT (ground truth) group showed no statistically significant difference for either clinician. However, the score differences in the AI group were significantly different between the two clinicians. The Kappa consistency index was 0.259. It took 3.45 s to delineate the chest wall CTV using the model. Conclusion: Our model could automatically generate the CTVs for breast cancer. AI-generated structures of the proposed model showed a trend that was comparable, or was even better, than those of human-generated structures. Additional multicentre evaluations should be performed for adequate validation before the model can be completely applied in clinical practice."

        "Author": "Angie N Ocampo",
        "Abstract": "Racial attitudes have long been studied for their salience to inter-group relations and the insight they provide into the nature of ethno-racial hierarchies. While research on racial attitudes among Latinos, now the largest minority group in the United States, has grown in recent decades, critical gaps remain. As such, this paper explores Latino immigrants' attitudes toward Whites, Blacks, and other Latinos across multiple dimensions, including perceived affluence, intelligence, cultural behaviors, and receptivity to contact. We examine cross-group and cross-dimension variation in attitudes in order to evaluate key theories in the literature on racial attitudes, including the effects of socio-demographic factors, social contact, perceived threat, and forms of insecurity. Overall, Latino attitudes do not neatly subscribe to White superiority across dimensions, as they perceive differences in intelligence to be more modest than those in affluence, and rate their own cultural behaviors above those of Whites. Increased contact is associated with more positive views toward Blacks, but more negative views toward Whites and to a lesser extent, other Latinos. Perceived threat results in lower evaluations of all groups, whereas greater insecurity results in negative attitudes toward Whites and Blacks, but appears to push Latinos closer to their own group. Overall, results suggest that among immigrant Latinos, greater integration and social contact reduce White supremacy, rather than simply improving attitudes towards all out-groups, but that the softening of anti-Black prejudice is undermined by perceived vulnerability to crime and anti-immigrant forces."

        "Abstract": "Effectiveness of computer vision techniques has been demonstrated through a number of applications, both within and outside healthcare. The operating room environment specifically is a setting with rich data sources compatible with computational approaches and high potential for direct patient benefit. The aim of this review is to summarize major topics in computer vision for surgical domains. The major capabilities of computer vision are described as an aid to surgical teams to improve performance and contribute to enhanced patient safety. Literature was identified through leading experts in the fields of surgery, computational analysis and modeling in medicine, and computer vision in healthcare. The literature supports the application of computer vision principles to surgery. Potential applications within surgery include operating room vigilance, endoscopic vigilance, and individual and team-wide behavioral analysis. To advance the field, we recommend collecting and publishing carefully annotated datasets. Doing so will enable the surgery community to collectively define well-specified common objectives for automated systems, spur academic research, mobilize industry, and provide benchmarks with which we can track progress. Leveraging computer vision approaches through interdisciplinary collaboration and advanced approaches to data acquisition, modeling, interpretation, and integration promises a powerful impact on patient safety, public health, and financial costs."

        "Abstract": "Introduction: Increasingly, the label \"data trust\" is being applied to repeatable mechanisms or approaches to sharing data in a timely, fair, safe, and equitable way. However, there is an absence of practical guidance regarding how to establish and operate a data trust. Aim and approach: In December 2019, the Canadian Institute for Health Information and the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence convened a working meeting of 19 people representing 15 Canadian organizations/initiatives involved in data sharing, most of which focus on public sector health data. The objective was to identify essential requirements for the establishment and operation of data trusts in the Canadian context. Preliminary requirements were discussed during the meeting and then refined as authors contributed to this manuscript. Results: Twelve minimum specification requirements (\"min specs\") for data trusts were identified. The foundational min spec is that data trusts must meet all legal requirements, including legal authority to collect, hold or share data. In addition, there was agreement that data trusts must have (i) an accountable governing body to ensure that the data trust achieves its stated purpose and is transparent, (ii) comprehensive data management including clear processes and qualified individuals responsible for the collection, storage, access, disclosure and use of data, (iii) training and accountability requirements for all data users and (iv) ongoing public and stakeholder engagement. Conclusions: Practical guidance for the establishment and operation of data trusts was articulated in the form of 12 min specs requirements. The 12 min specs are a starting point. Future work to refine and strengthen them with members of the public, companies, and additional research data stakeholders from within and outside of Canada, is recommended."

        "Author": "Liam J Caffery",
        "Abstract": "There is optimism that artificial intelligence (AI) will result in positive clinical outcomes, which is driving research and investment in the use of AI for skin disease. At present, AI for skin disease is embedded in research and development and not practiced widely in clinical dermatology. Clinical dermatology is also undergoing a technological transformation in terms of the development and adoption of standards that optimizes the quality use of imaging. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) is the international standard for medical imaging. DICOM is a continually evolving standard. There is considerable effort being invested in developing dermatology-specific extensions to the DICOM standard. The ability to encode relevant metadata and afford interoperability with the digital health ecosystem (e.g., image repositories, electronic medical records) has driven the initial impetus in the adoption of DICOM for dermatology. DICOM has a dedicated working group whose role is to develop a mechanism to support AI workflows and encode AI artifacts. DICOM can improve AI workflows by encoding derived objects (e.g., secondary images, visual explainability maps, AI algorithm output) and the efficient curation of multi-institutional datasets for machine learning training, testing, and validation. This can be achieved using DICOM mechanisms such as standardized image formats and metadata, metadata-based image retrieval, and de-identification protocols. DICOM can address several important technological and workflow challenges for the implementation of AI. However, many other technological, ethical, regulatory, medicolegal, and workforce barriers will need to be addressed before DICOM and AI can be used effectively in dermatology."

        "Abstract": "Introduction: Regarding the neurofeedback training process, previous studies indicate that 10%-50% of subjects cannot gain control over their brain activity even after repeated training sessions. This study is conducted to overcome this problem by investigating inter-individual differences in neurofeedback learning to propose some predictors for the trainability of subjects. Methods: Eight healthy female students took part in 8 (electroencephalography) EEG neurofeedback training sessions for enhancing EEG gamma power at the Oz channel. We studied participants' preexisting fluid intelligence and EEG frequency sub-bands' power during 2-min eyes-closed rest and a cognitive task as psychological and neurophysiological factors, concerning neurofeedback learning performance. We also assessed the self-reports of participants about mental strategies used by them during neurofeedback to identify the most effective successful strategies. Results: The results revealed that a significant percentage of individuals (25% in this study) cannot learn how to control their brain gamma activity using neurofeedback. Our findings suggest that fluid intelligence, gamma power during a cognitive task, and alpha power at rest can predict gamma-enhancing neurofeedback performance of individuals. Based on our study, neurofeedback learning is a form of implicit learning. We also found that learning without a user's mental efforts to find out successful mental strategies, in other words, unconscious learning, lead to more success in gamma-enhancing neurofeedback. Conclusion: Our results may improve gamma neurofeedback efficacy for further clinical usage and studies by giving insight about both non-trainable individuals and effective mental strategies."

        "Title": "Creating a Compassionate World: Addressing the Conflicts Between Sharing and Caring Versus Controlling and Holding Evolved Strategies",
        "Author": "Paul Gilbert",
        "Abstract": "For thousands of years, various spiritual traditions and social activists have appealed to humans to adopt compassionate ways of living to address the suffering of life. Yet, along with our potential for compassion and self-sacrifice, the last few thousand years of wars, slavery, tortures, and holocausts have shown humans can be extraordinarily selfish, callous, vicious, and cruel. While there has been considerable engagement with these issues, particularly in the area of moral psychology and ethics, this paper explores an evolutionary analysis relating to evolved resource-regulation strategies that can be called \"care and share\" versus \"control and hold.\" Control and hold are typical of primates that operate through intimidatory social hierarchies. Care and share are less common in non-human primates, but evolved radically in humans during our hunter-gatherer stage when our ancestors lived in relatively interdependent, small, mobile groups. In these groups, individualistic, self-focus, and self-promoting control and hold strategies (trying to secure and accumulate more than others) were shunned and shamed. These caring and sharing hunter-gatherer lifestyles also created the social contexts for the evolution of new forms of childcare and complex human competencies for language, reasoning, planning, empathy, and self-awareness. As a result of our new 'intelligence', our ancestors developed agriculture that reduced mobility, increased group size, resource availability and storage, and resource competition. These re-introduced competing for, rather than sharing of, resources and advantaged those who now pursue (often aggressively) control and hold strategies. Many of our most typical forms of oppressive and anti-compassionate behavior are the result of these strategies. Rather than (just) thinking about individuals competing with one another, we can also consider these different resource regulation strategies as competing within populations shaping psychophysiological patterns; both wealth and poverty change the brain. One of the challenges to creating a more compassionate society is to find ways to create the social and economic conditions that regulate control and hold strategies and promote care and share. No easy task."

        "Abstract": "In this paper, an artificial intelligence segmented dynamic video image based on the process of intensive cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease monitoring is deeply investigated, and a sparse automatic coding deep neural network with a four layers stack structure is designed to automatically extract the deep features of the segmented dynamic video image shot, and six categories of normal, atrial premature, ventricular premature, right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, and pacing are achieved through hierarchical training and optimization. Accurate recognition of heartbeats with an average accuracy of 99.5%. It provides technical assistance for the intelligent prediction of high-risk cardiovascular diseases like ventricular fibrillation. An intelligent prediction algorithm for sudden cardiac death based on the echolocation network was proposed. By designing an echolocation network with a multilayer serial structure, an intelligent distinction between sudden cardiac death signal and non-sudden death signal was realized, and the signal was predicted 5 min before sudden death occurred, with an average prediction accuracy of 94.32%. Using the self-learning capability of stack sparse auto-coding network, a large amount of label-free data is designed to train the stack sparse auto-coding deep neural network to automatically extract deep representations of plaque features. A small amount of labeled data then introduced to micro-train the entire network. Through the automatic analysis of the fiber cap thickness in the plaques, the automatic identification of thin fiber cap-like vulnerable plaques was achieved, and the average overlap of vulnerable regions reached 87%. The overall time for the automatic plaque and vulnerable plaque recognition algorithm was 0.54 s. It provides theoretical support for accurate diagnosis and endogenous analysis of high-risk cardiovascular diseases."

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have caused a paradigm shift in healthcare that can be used for decision support and forecasting by exploring medical data. Recent studies have shown that AI and ML can be used to fight COVID-19. The objective of this article is to summarize the recent AI- and ML-based studies that have addressed the pandemic. From an initial set of 634 articles, a total of 49 articles were finally selected through an inclusion-exclusion process. In this article, we have explored the objectives of the existing studies (i.e., the role of AI/ML in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic); the context of the studies (i.e., whether it was focused on a specific country-context or with a global perspective; the type and volume of the dataset; and the methodology, algorithms, and techniques adopted in the prediction or diagnosis processes). We have mapped the algorithms and techniques with the data type by highlighting their prediction/classification accuracy. From our analysis, we categorized the objectives of the studies into four groups: disease detection, epidemic forecasting, sustainable development, and disease diagnosis. We observed that most of these studies used deep learning algorithms on image-data, more specifically on chest X-rays and CT scans. We have identified six future research opportunities that we have summarized in this paper. Impact Statement: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning(ML) methods have been widely used to assist in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. A very few in-depth literature reviews have been conducted to synthesize the knowledge and identify future research agenda including a previously published review on data science for COVID-19 in this article. In this article, we synthesized reviewed recent literature that focuses on the usages and applications of AI and ML to fight against COVID-19. We have identified seven future research directions that would guide researchers to conduct future research. The most significant of these are: develop new treatment options, explore the contextual effect and variation in research outcomes, support the health care workforce, and explore the effect and variation in research outcomes based on different types of data."

The purposes of our study are (1) to explore the cartilage thickness in anatomical regions of the knee joint among a large collection of healthy knees, and (2) to investigate the relationship between the thinning pattern of the cartilages and the increasing ages. Methods: In this retrospective study, 2,481 healthy knees (subjects ranging from 15 to 64 years old, mean age: 35 ± 10 years) were recruited. With magnetic resonance images of knees acquired on a 3-T superconducting scanner, we automatically and precisely segmented the cartilage via deep learning and calculated the cartilage thickness in 14 anatomical regions. The thickness readings were compared using ANOVA by considering the factors of age, sex, and side. We further tracked the relationship between the thinning pattern of the cartilage thickness and the increasing ages by regression analysis. Results: The cartilage thickness was always thicker in the femur than corresponding regions in the tibia (p < 0.05). Regression analysis suggested cartilage thinning alongside ages in all regions (p < 0.05) except for medial and lateral anterior tibia in both females and males (p > 0.05). The thinning speed of men was faster than women in medial anterior and lateral anterior femur, yet slower in the medial patella (p < 0.05). Conclusion: We established the calculation method of cartilage thickness using big data and deep learning. We demonstrated that cartilage thickness differed across individual regions in the knee joint. Cartilage thinning alongside ages was identified, and the thinning pattern was consistent in the tibia while inconsistent in patellar and femoral between sexes. These findings provide a potential reference to detect cartilage anomaly."

        "Author": "Ling-Rui Li",
        "Abstract": "Thyroid cancers (TC) have increasingly been detected following advances in diagnostic methods. Risk stratification guided by refined information becomes a crucial step toward the goal of personalized medicine. The diagnosis of TC mainly relies on imaging analysis, but visual examination may not reveal much information and not enable comprehensive analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology used to extract and quantify key image information by simulating complex human functions. This latent, precise information contributes to stratify TC on the distinct risk and drives tailored management to transit from the surface (population-based) to a point (individual-based). In this review, we started with several challenges regarding personalized care in TC, for example, inconsistent rating ability of ultrasound physicians, uncertainty in cytopathological diagnosis, difficulty in discriminating follicular neoplasms, and inaccurate prognostication. We then analyzed and summarized the advances of AI to extract and analyze morphological, textural, and molecular features to reveal the ground truth of TC. Consequently, their combination with AI technology will make individual medical strategies possible."

        "Author": "Batuer Aikemu",
        "Abstract": "Background: Personalized and novel evidence-based clinical treatment strategy consulting for colorectal cancer has been available through various artificial intelligence (AI) supporting systems such as Watson for Oncology (WFO) from IBM. However, the potential effects of this supporting tool in cancer care have not been thoroughly explored in real-world studies. This research aims to investigate the concordance between treatment recommendations for colorectal cancer patients made by WFO and a multidisciplinary team (MDT) at a major comprehensive gastrointestinal cancer center. Methods: In this prospective study, both WFO and the blinded MDT's treatment recommendations were provided concurrently for enrolled colorectal cancers of stages II to IV between March 2017 and January 2018 at Shanghai Minimally Invasive Surgery Center. Concordance was achieved if the cancer team's decisions were listed in the \"recommended\" or \"for consideration\" classification in WFO. A review was carried out after 100 cases for all non-concordant patients to explain the inconsistency, and corresponding feedback was given to WFO's database. The concordance of the subsequent cases was analyzed to evaluate both the performance and learning ability of WFO. Results: Overall, 250 patients met the inclusion criteria and were recruited in the study. Eighty-one were diagnosed with colon cancer and 189 with rectal cancer. The concordances for colon cancer, rectal cancer, or overall were all 91%. The overall rates were 83, 94, and 88% in subgroups of stages II, III, and IV. When categorized by treatment strategy, concordances were 97, 93, 89, 87, and 100% for neoadjuvant, surgery, adjuvant, first line, and second line treatment groups, respectively. After analyzing the main factors causing discordance, relative updates were made in the database accordingly, which led to the concordance curve rising in most groups compared with the initial rates. Conclusion: Clinical recommendations made by WFO and the cancer team were highly matched for colorectal cancer. Patient age, cancer stage, and the consideration of previous therapy details had a significant influence on concordance. Addressing these perspectives will facilitate the use of the cancer decision-support systems to help oncologists achieve the promise of precision medicine."

        "Author": "Nilofar Noor",
        "Abstract": "Aim: To compare the oocyte yield using three-dimensional (3D) automated and two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound-based follicle tracking in women undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET). Settings and design: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Reproductive Medicine Unit of a teaching medical institute from January 2017 to December 2018. Materials and methods: A total of 130 patients undergoing IVF-ET were enrolled and randomized into two groups (65 patients in each group). In Group A, follicular tracking during controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) was done using 3D Sonography- based Automated Volume Count (SonoAVC), whereas in Group B, follicular tracking was done by manual ultrasonography (2D USG). The primary outcome measures were the number of oocytes retrieved (the total number and the number of mature oocytes). Secondary outcomes were fertilization rate, cleavage rate, total number of embryos and time taken to perform scans. Other outcome measures were clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and live birth rate (LBR). Statistical analysis used: Chi-square test, Student's t-test, Z-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Bland-Altman's plot. Results: The two groups were comparable with regard to assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes. Group B required more time for performing the scan (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Automated SonoAVC ultrasound can be used interchangeably with manual 2D USG for follicle tracking during COS giving comparable ART outcomes with the added advantage of saving time. Our study implies the promising results of applying artificial intelligence in follicular tracking during COS."

        "Author": "Yongjiu Zou",
        "Abstract": "The parallel evolution of wearable electronics, artificial intelligence, and fifth-generation wireless technology has created a technological paradigm with the potential to change our lives profoundly. Despite this, addressing limitations linked to continuous, sustainable, and pervasive powering of wearable electronics remains a bottleneck to overcome in order to maximize the exponential benefit that these technologies can bring once synergized. A recent groundbreaking discovery has demonstrated that by using the coupling effect of contact electrification and electrostatic induction, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) can efficiently convert irregular and low-frequency passive biomechanical energy from body movements into electrical energy, providing an infinite and sustainable power source for wearable electronics. A number of human motions have been exploited to properly and efficiently harness this energy potential, including human ambulation. Shoes are an indispensable component of daily wearing and can be leveraged as an excellent platform to exploit such kinetic energy. In this article, the latest representative achievements of TENG-based smart electricity-generating shoes are comprehensively reviewed. We summarize ways in which not only can biomechanical energy be scavenged via ambulatory motion, but also biomonitoring of health parameters via tracking of rhythm and strength of pace can be implemented to aid in theranostic fields. This work provides a systematical review of the rational structural design, practical applications, scenario analysis, and performance evaluation of TENG-based smart shoes for wearable electricity generation. In addition, the perspective for future development of smart electricity-generation shoes as a sustainable and pervasive energy solution towards the upcoming era of the Internet of Things is discussed."

        "Author": "Madelena Stauss",
        "Abstract": "The use of telehealth to support, enhance or substitute traditional methods of delivering healthcare is becoming increasingly common in many specialties, such as stroke care, radiology and oncology. There is reason to believe that this approach remains underutilized within nephrology, which is somewhat surprising given the fact that nephrologists have always driven technological change in developing dialysis technology. Despite the obvious benefits that telehealth may provide, robust evidence remains lacking and many of the studies are anecdotal, limited to small numbers or without conclusive proof of benefit. More worryingly, quite a few studies report unexpected obstacles, pitfalls or patient dissatisfaction. However, with increasing global threats such as climate change and infectious disease, a change in approach to delivery of healthcare is needed. The current pandemic with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has prompted the renal community to embrace telehealth to an unprecedented extent and at speed. In that sense the pandemic has already served as a disruptor, changed clinical practice and shown immense transformative potential. Here, we provide an update on current evidence and use of telehealth within various areas of nephrology globally, including the fields of dialysis, inpatient care, virtual consultation and patient empowerment. We also provide a brief primer on the use of artificial intelligence in this context and speculate about future implications. We also highlight legal aspects and pitfalls and discuss the 'digital divide' as a key concept that healthcare providers need to be mindful of when providing telemedicine-based approaches. Finally, we briefly discuss the immediate use of telenephrology at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope to provide clinical nephrologists with an overview of what is currently available, as well as a glimpse into what may be expected in the future."

        "Author": "Aslı Bozdağ",
        "Abstract": "With the increase in population and industrialization, air pollution has become one of the global problems nowadays. Therefore, air pollutant parameters should be measured at regular intervals, and the necessary measures should be taken by evaluating the results of measurements. In order to prevent air pollution, pollutant parameters must be evaluated within the framework of a model. Recently, in order to obtain objective and more sensitive results with regard to air pollution nowadays, studies, which use machine learning algorithms in artificial intelligence technologies, have been carried out. In this study, PM10 concentrations, which are obtained from 7 stations in Ankara province in Turkey, were trained with machine learning algorithms (LASSO, SVR, RF, kNN, xGBoost, ANN). The PM10 concentrations of the years 2009-2017 of 6 stations in Ankara were given as input, and the PM10 concentrations of the seventh station for the year 2018 were predicted. The model development stage was repeated for each station, and the performance and error rates of the algorithms were determined by comparing the results produced by the algorithms with the actual results. The best results were provided with ANN (R2 = 0.58, RMSE = 20.8, MAE = 14.4). The spatial distribution of the estimated concentration results was provided through Geographic Information System (GIS), and spatial strategies for improving air pollution over land use were established."

        "Abstract": "Background and purpose: To develop an artificial intelligence-based full-process solution for rectal cancer radiotherapy. Materials and methods: A full-process solution that integrates autosegmentation and automatic treatment planning was developed under a single deep-learning framework. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to generate segmentations of the target and the organs at risk (OAR) as well as dose distribution. A script in Pinnacle that simulates the treatment planning process was used to execute plan optimization. A total of 172 rectal cancer patients were used for model training, and 18 patients were used for model validation. Another 40 rectal cancer patients were used for an end-to-end evaluation for both autosegmentation and treatment planning. The PTV and OAR segmentation was compared with manual segmentation. The planning results was evaluated by both objective and subjective assessment. Results: The total time for full-process planning without contour modification was 7 min, and an additional 15 min may require for contour modification and re-optimization. The PTV DICE similarity coefficient was greater than 0.85 for all 40 patients in the evaluation dataset while the DICE indices of the OARs also indicated good performance. There were no significant differences between the auto plans and manual plans. The physician accepted 80% of the auto plans without any further operation. Conclusion: We developed a deep learning-based automatic solution for rectal cancer treatment that can improve the efficiency of treatment planning."

For this purpose, on the basis of 3D (three-dimensional) data sets of 175 MRONJ patients, the outline of the necrosis was marked with the software iPlan 3.0.5 (BrainLAB AG) thus determining the respective volume. The correlation of this volume with other 31 collected parameters was analyzed retrospectively. There was a significant correlation between the defect volume on the one hand, and the MRONJ stage, the number of performed operations, and the therapy invasiveness on the other hand. Furthermore, it could be shown that in one third of the cases no defects could be recognized in the 2D imaging by panoramic radiograph, while in the 3D data sets defects already had been demarcated. On the basis of these data, a computer-aided tool based on the principles of AI was developed and validated, which might allow the automated calculation of the 3D defect extension and classification of the MRONJ cases into a ranking system. In conclusion, preparation of a 3D image can be recommended for reliably making the diagnosis \"MRONJ.\" Moreover, knowledge of the exact defect volume serves as a decision-making aid with regard to the choice of therapy, ensures intraoperative certitude, and allows an assessment of the prognosis."

        "Author": "Florencia Clément",
        "Abstract": "Introduction: Practice guidelines cannot recommend establishing a diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) without performing growth hormone stimulation tests (GHST) in children with risk factors, due to the lack of sufficient evidence. Objective: Our goal was to generate an evidence-based prediction rule to diagnose GHD in children with growth failure and clinically identifiable risk factors. Methods: We studied a cohort of children with growth failure to build the prediction model, and a second, independent cohort to validate the prediction rule. To this end, we assessed the existence of: pituitary dysgenesis, midline abnormalities, (supra)sellar tumor/surgery, CNS infection, traumatic brain injury, cranial radiotherapy, chemotherapy, genetic GHD, pituitary hormone deficiencies, and neonatal hypoglycemia, cholestasis, or hypogenitalism. Selection of variables for model building was performed using artificial intelligence protocols. Specificity of the prediction rule was the main outcome measure in the validation set. Results: In the first cohort (n=770), the resulting prediction rule stated that a patient would have GHD if (s)he had: pituitary dysgenesis, or two or more anterior pituitary deficiencies, or one anterior pituitary deficiency plus: neonatal hypoglycemia or hypogenitalism, or diabetes insipidus, or midline abnormalities, or (supra)sellar tumor/surgery, or cranial radiotherapy ≥18 Gy. In the validation cohort (n=161), the specificity of the prediction rule was 99.2% (95% CI: 95.6-100%). Conclusions: This clinical rule predicts the existence of GHD with high specificity in children with growth disorders and clinically identifiable risk factors, thus providing compelling evidence to recommend that GHD can be safely diagnosed without recurring to GHST in neonates and children with growth failure and specific comorbidities."

        "Author": "John B Williamson",
        "Abstract": "Background: Cerebral metabolites are associated with different physiological processes in brain aging. Cortical and limbic structures play important roles in cognitive aging; however, the relationship between these structures and age remains unclear with respect to physiological underpinnings. Regional differences in metabolite levels may be related to different structural and cognitive changes in aging. Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy were obtained from 117 cognitively healthy older adults. Limbic and other key structural volumes were measured. Concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and choline-containing compounds (Cho) were measured in frontal and parietal regions. Neuropsychological testing was performed including measures of crystallized and fluid intelligence and memory. Results: NAA in the frontal voxel was associated with limbic and cortical volumes, whereas Cho in parietal cortex was negatively associated with hippocampal and other regional volumes. Hippocampal volume was associated with forgetting, independent of age. Further, parietal Cho and hippocampal volume contributed independent variance to age corrected discrepancy between fluid and crystallized abilities. Conclusion: These findings suggest that physiological changes with age in the frontal and parietal cortices may be linked to structural changes in other connected brain regions. These changes are differentially associated with cognitive performance, suggesting potentially divergent mechanisms."

        "Abstract": "Objective: The aim of the research is to identify specific of AI in healthcare, its nature, and specifics and to establish complexities of AI implementation in healthcare and to propose ways to eliminate them. Patients and methods: Materials and methods: This study was conducted during June-October of 2020. Through a broad literature review, analysis of EU, USA regulation acts, scientific researches and opinions of progressive-minded people in this sphere this paper provide a guide to understanding the essence of AI in healthcare and specifics of its regulation. It is based on dialectical, comparative, analytic, synthetic and comprehensive methods. Results: Results: One of the first broad definitions of AI sounded like \"Artificial Intelligence is the study of ideas which enable computers to do the things that make people seem intelligent ... The central goals of Artificial Intelligence are to make computers more useful and to understand the principles which make intelligence possible.\" There are two approaches to name this technology - \"Artificial intelligence\" and \"Augmented Intelligence.\" We prefer to use a more common category of \"Artificial intelligence\" rather than \"Augmented Intelligence\" because the last one, from our point of view, leaves much space for \"human supervision\" meaning, and that will limit the sense of AI while it will undoubtedly develop in future. AI in current practice is interpreted in three forms, they are: AI as a simple electronic tool without any level of autonomy (like electronic assistant, \"calculator\"), AI as an entity with some level of autonomy, but under human control, and AI as an entity with broad autonomy, substituting human's activity wholly or partly, and we have to admit that the first one cannot be considered as AI at all in current conditions of science development. Description of AI often tends to operate with big technological products like DeepMind (by Google), Watson Health (by IBM), Healthcare's Edison (by General Electric), but in fact, a lot of smaller technologies also use AI in the healthcare field - smartphone applications, wearable health devices and other examples of the Internet of Things. At the current stage of development AI in medical practice is existing in three technical forms: software, hardware, and mixed forms using three main scientific-statistical approaches - flowchart method, database method, and decision-making method. All of them are useable, but they are differently suiting for AI implementation. The main issues of AI implementation in healthcare are connected with the nature of technology in itself, complexities of legal support in terms of safety and efficiency, privacy, ethical and liability concerns. Conclusion: Conclusion: The conducted analysis makes it possible to admit a number of pros and cons in the field of AI using in healthcare. Undoubtedly this is a promising area with a lot of gaps and grey zones to fill in. Furthermore, the main challenge is not on technology itself, which is rapidly growing, evolving, and uncovering new areas of its use, but rather on the legal framework that is clearly lacking appropriate regulations and some political, ethical, and financial transformations. Thus, the core questions regarding is this technology by its nature is suitable for healthcare at all? Is the current legislative framework looking appropriate to regulate AI in terms of safety, efficiency, premarket, and postmarked monitoring? How the model of liability with connection to AI technology using in healthcare should be constructed? How to ensure privacy without the restriction of AI technology use? Should intellectual privacy rights prevail over public health concerns? Many questions to address in order to move in line with technology development and to get the benefits of its practical implementation."

        "Author": "Karlijn Sporrel",
        "Abstract": "Introduction: Many adults do not reach the recommended physical activity (PA) guidelines, which can lead to serious health problems. A promising method to increase PA is the use of smartphone PA applications. However, despite the development and evaluation of multiple PA apps, it remains unclear how to develop and design engaging and effective PA apps. Furthermore, little is known on ways to harness the potential of artificial intelligence for developing personalized apps. In this paper, we describe the design and development of the Playful data-driven Active Urban Living (PAUL): a personalized PA application. Methods: The two-phased development process of the PAUL apps rests on principles from the behavior change model; the Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share (IDEAS) framework; and the behavioral intervention technology (BIT) model. During the first phase, we explored whether location-specific information on performing PA in the built environment is an enhancement to a PA app. During the second phase, the other modules of the app were developed. To this end, we first build the theoretical foundation for the PAUL intervention by performing a literature study. Next, a focus group study was performed to translate the theoretical foundations and the needs and wishes in a set of user requirements. Since the participants indicated the need for reminders at a for-them-relevant moment, we developed a self-learning module for the timing of the reminders. To initialize this module, a data-mining study was performed with historical running data to determine good situations for running. Results: The results of these studies informed the design of a personalized mobile health (mHealth) application for running, walking, and performing strength exercises. The app is implemented as a set of modules based on the persuasive strategies \"monitoring of behavior,\" \"feedback,\" \"goal setting,\" \"reminders,\" \"rewards,\" and \"providing instruction.\" An architecture was set up consisting of a smartphone app for the user, a back-end server for storage and adaptivity, and a research portal to provide access to the research team. Conclusions: The interdisciplinary research encompassing psychology, human movement sciences, computer science, and artificial intelligence has led to a theoretically and empirically driven leisure time PA application. In the current phase, the feasibility of the PAUL app is being assessed."

        "Abstract": "Radiology historically has been a leader of digital transformation in healthcare. The introduction of digital imaging systems, picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), and teleradiology transformed radiology services over the past 30 years. Radiology is again at the crossroad for the next generation of transformation, possibly evolving as a one-stop integrated diagnostic service. Artificial intelligence and machine learning promise to offer radiology new powerful new digital tools to facilitate the next transformation. The radiology community has been developing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools based on machine learning (ML) over the past 20 years. Among various AI techniques, deep-learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) and its variants have been widely used in medical image pattern recognition. Since the 1990s, many CAD tools and products have been developed. However, clinical adoption has been slow due to a lack of substantial clinical advantages, difficulties integrating into existing workflow, and uncertain business models. This paper proposes three pathways for AI's role in radiology beyond current CNN based capabilities 1) improve the performance of CAD, 2) improve the productivity of radiology service by AI-assisted workflow, and 3) develop radiomics that integrate the data from radiology, pathology, and genomics to facilitate the emergence of a new integrated diagnostic service."

        "Abstract": "Currently, preoperative diagnosis and differentiation of renal clear cell carcinoma and other subtypes remain a serious challenge for doctors. The liquid biopsy technique and artificial intelligence have inspired the pursuit of distinguishing clear cell renal cell carcinoma using clinically available test data. In this work, a method called liq_ccRCC based on the integration of clinical blood and urine indices through machine learning approaches was successfully designed to achieve this goal. Clinically available biochemical blood data and urine indices were collected from 306 patients with renal cell carcinoma. Finally, the integration of 18 top-ranked clinical liquid indices (13 blood samples and 5 urine samples) was proven to be able to distinguish renal clear cell carcinoma from other subtypes of renal carcinoma by cross-valuation with an AUC of 0.9372. The successful introduction of this identification method suggests that subtype differentiation of renal cell carcinoma can be accomplished based on clinical liquid test data, which is noninvasive and easy to perform. It has huge potential to be developed as a promising innovation strategy for preoperative subtype differentiation of renal cell carcinoma with the advantages of convenience and real-time testing. liq_ccRCC is available online for the free test of readers at http://lishuyan.lzu.edu.cn/liq_ccRCC."

        "Abstract": "Purpose of review: The present review attempts to provide a comprehensive and critical overview of the neurocognitive mechanisms of gambling disorder (GD), problematic pornography use (PPU) and binge-eating disorder (BED), focusing specifically on decision-making processes. Recent findings: GD, PPU and BED have been associated with decision-making impairments both under risk and ambiguity. Features such as intelligence, emotions, social variables, cognitive distortions, comorbidities, or arousal may condition decision-making processes in these individuals. Summary: Impairments in decision-making seem to be a shared transdiagnostic feature of these disorders We also hypothesized the EG relative to the NEG group would demonstrate weaker relationships between problem-gambling severity and health/functioning measures (e.g., substance use) and gambling behaviors (e.g., more time spent gambling) given that EG would account for some of the variance in the relationships between ARPG and these measures. However, there is varying support for the degree to which different features may affect decision-making. Therefore, the study of decision-making processes can provide crucial evidence for understanding addictions and other disorders with addiction-like symptomatology."

        "Author": "Jennifer Hobbs",
        "Abstract": "Natural flowering affects fruit development and quality, and impacts the harvest of specialty plants like pineapple. Pineapple growers use chemicals to induce flowering so that most plants within a field produce fruit of high quality that is ready to harvest at the same time. Since pineapple is hand-harvested, the ability to harvest all of the fruit of a field in a single pass is critical to reduce field losses, costs, and waste, and to maximize efficiency. Traditionally, due to high planting densities, pineapple growers have been limited to gathering crop intelligence through manual inspection around the edges of the field, giving them only a limited view of their crop's status. Through the advances in remote sensing and computer vision, we can enable the regular inspection of the field and automated inflorescence counting enabling growers to optimize their management practices. Our work uses a deep learning-based density estimation approach to count the number of flowering pineapple plants in a field with a test MAE of 11.5 and MAPD of 6.37%. Notably, the computational complexity of this method does not depend on the number of plants present and therefore efficiently scale to easily detect over a 1.6 million flowering plants in a field. We further embed this approach in an active learning framework for continual learning and model improvement."

        "Title": "Developing an Instrument for Assessing Self-Efficacy in Data Mining and Analysis",
        "Author": "Yu-Min Wang",
        "Abstract": "With the continuous progress and penetration of automated data collection technology, enterprises and organizations are facing the problem of information overload. The demand for expertise in data mining and analysis is increasing. Self-efficacy is a pivotal construct that is significantly related to willingness and ability to perform a particular task. Thus, the objective of this study is to develop an instrument for assessing self-efficacy in data mining and analysis. An initial measurement list was developed based on the skills and abilities about executing data mining and analysis, and expert recommendations. A useful sample of 103 university students completed the online survey questionnaire. A 19-item four-factor model was extracted by exploratory factor analysis. Using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling technique (PLS-SEM), the model was cross-examined. The instrument showed satisfactory reliability and validity. The proposed instrument will be of value to researchers and practitioners in evaluating an individual's abilities and readiness in executing data mining and analysis."

        "Author": "Ismael Muela",
        "Abstract": "Background: Distorted gambling-related cognitions are tightly related to gambling problems, and are one of the main targets of treatment for disordered gambling, but their etiology remains uncertain. Although folk wisdom and some theoretical approaches have linked them to lower domain-general reasoning abilities, evidence regarding that relationship remains unconvincing. Method: In the present cross-sectional study, the relationship between probabilistic/abstract reasoning, as measured by the Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT), and the Matrices Test, respectively, and the five dimensions of the Gambling-Related Cognitions Scale (GRCS), was tested in a sample of 77 patients with gambling disorder and 58 individuals without gambling problems. Results and interpretation: Neither BNT nor matrices scores were significantly related to gambling-related cognitions, according to frequentist (MANCOVA/ANCOVA) analyses, performed both considering and disregarding group (patients, non-patients) in the models. Correlation Bayesian analyses (bidirectional BF10) largely supported the null hypothesis, i.e., the absence of relationships between the measures of interest. This pattern or results reinforces the idea that distorted cognitions do not originate in a general lack of understanding of probability or low fluid intelligence, but probably result from motivated reasoning."

        "Title": "Diversified Talent Cultivation Mechanism of Early Childhood Physical Education Under the Full-Practice Concept - Oriented by Preschooler Mental Health and Intelligent Teaching",
        "Author": "Nina Wang",
        "Abstract": "In order to improve early childhood physical education, in this study, the talent cultivation mechanism for undergraduates was explored under the \"full-practice\" concept, oriented by preschooler mental health. First, from the perspective of preschooler psychology, the mechanisms of ability training and talent cultivation for undergraduates majoring in early childhood education were explored under the \"full-practice\" concept. Considering that the physical, psychological, and intellectual development of preschoolers shall follow the rules of physical education, and current early childhood education mainly focuses on intelligence education in China, early childhood physical education was analyzed further in this study. By investigating the undergraduate majors of early childhood education in Henan University, this study first summarized the current problems in early childhood education systems in universities. Secondly, combined with the form of physical education in kindergartens, strategies for talent cultivation and curriculum setting of early childhood physical education majors in colleges and universities were proposed. Finally, from the perspective of innovation and diversification of training forms, the cultivation of early childhood educators' physical education ability was analyzed at multiple levels and multiple objectives, and the integrated training system of early childhood education talents was constructed. The results show that, among all the courses for early childhood education major, compulsory courses account for 81.2% and optional courses account for 18.8%. In addition, a survey on undergraduates' attitudes toward the curriculum of their major demonstrates that 81.2% of the undergraduates thought that the range and content of practical courses should be increased, indicating that undergraduates majoring in early childhood education are dissatisfied with the current curriculum system, and they have an increased demand for practical courses. Correspondingly, it is vital to build and improve on the early childhood physical education. In terms of its talent cultivation, the \"full-practice\" concept helps combine theory with practice to improve the effectiveness of education and teaching, pushing forward the reform of the education system. Meanwhile, data- and intelligence-oriented teaching will become the new direction of modern sports development, as well as an important link for tracking and monitoring children's sports teaching in China. Through the continuous introduction of wearable artificial intelligence (AI) products, real-time monitoring of children's physical conditions can be realized, which helps improve the effectiveness of early childhood physical education."

        "Title": "Artificial Intelligence Is Stupid and Causal Reasoning Will Not Fix It",
        "Author": "J Mark Bishop",
        "Abstract": "Artificial Neural Networks have reached \"grandmaster\" and even \"super-human\" performance across a variety of games, from those involving perfect information, such as Go, to those involving imperfect information, such as \"Starcraft\". Such technological developments from artificial intelligence (AI) labs have ushered concomitant applications across the world of business, where an \"AI\" brand-tag is quickly becoming ubiquitous. A corollary of such widespread commercial deployment is that when AI gets things wrong-an autonomous vehicle crashes, a chatbot exhibits \"racist\" behavior, automated credit-scoring processes \"discriminate\" on gender, etc.-there are often significant financial, legal, and brand consequences, and the incident becomes major news. As Judea Pearl sees it, the underlying reason for such mistakes is that \"... all the impressive achievements of deep learning amount to just curve fitting.\" The key, as Pearl suggests, is to replace \"reasoning by association\" with \"causal reasoning\" -the ability to infer causes from observed phenomena. It is a point that was echoed by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis in a recent piece for the New York Times: \"we need to stop building computer systems that merely get better and better at detecting statistical patterns in data sets-often using an approach known as 'Deep Learning'-and start building computer systems that from the moment of their assembly innately grasp three basic concepts: time, space, and causality.\" In this paper, foregrounding what in 1949 Gilbert Ryle termed \"a category mistake\", I will offer an alternative explanation for AI errors; it is not so much that AI machinery cannot \"grasp\" causality, but that AI machinery (qua computation) cannot understand anything at all."

        "Title": "Sex Differences in Autism Spectrum Disorder: An Investigation on Core Symptoms and Psychiatric Comorbidity in Preschoolers",
        "Author": "Margherita Prosperi",
        "Abstract": "Findings regarding sex differences in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as far as core symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities (PC) are concerned, are inconsistent, inconclusive, or conflicting among studies. The lower prevalence of ASD in females than in males and the age and intelligence quotient (IQ) heterogeneity among samples made it difficult to investigate these differences. This case-control study tries to deepen the impact of sex differences on core symptoms of autism and PC in 214 preschoolers with ASD (mean age, 45.26) without impairment in non-verbal IQ (nvIQ ≥70). A total of 107 ASD females (mean age, 44.51 ± 13.79 months) were matched one by one with 107 males (mean age, 46.01 ± 13.42 months) for chronological age (±6 months) and nvIQ (±6 points). We used the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule 2 (ADOS-2) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 1.5-5 to explore autism severity and PC. The results highlight that ASD females did not significantly differ from ASD males regarding the severity of autism. Statistically significant lower levels of emotionally reactive (p = 0.005, η2 = 0.04), anxious-depressed (p = 0.001, η 2 = 0.05), internalizing problems (p = 0.04, η 2 = 0.02), and DSM-Oriented Scales anxiety problems (p = 0.02, η 2 = 0.04) in ASD females than in ASD males were also detected. Our findings of no difference in the autism severity and lower internalizing problems in females than males with ASD extend the knowledge of autism in females during preschool years. Compared to other similar studies on this topic, we can state that these results are not supported by differences in nvIQ between sexes nor by the presence of cognitive impairment. It confirms the need for clinicians to consider sex differences when describing autism psychopathology."

        "Title": "Public psychology and the Cold War brainwashing scare",
        "Author": "Charlie Williams",
        "Abstract": "In 1950, a new word 'brainwashing' entered the English language. Though its meaning was always ambiguous and continuously evolving, it captured various concerns about the future uses of psychology in warfare and domestic life and the potential for new technologies to control and manipulate human minds. Recent scholarship on what historians have called the 'Cold War brainwashing scare' has tended to treat brainwashing as a Cold War paranoia or fantasy that not only was never to be, but was never really supported by scientific research. Drawing on recent scholarship and my own research, this paper examines some of the interactions between experts and popular discourses on brainwashing. For many experts, the Cold War brainwashing scare offered an opportunity to engage the public with contemporary psychological theory and research. But it was by no means a discussion over which they had complete control. It will be argued that the popular debate about brainwashing was not only a question of dealing with scientific 'facts', but existed in a more diverse imaginary concerned as much with present realities, as it was with future possibilities. Much in the same way that stories about artificial intelligence are reported today, discussions of techniques of brainwashing were often accompanied by speculation both wild and grounded about how new technology may be used in the future and by whom. This paper covers three examples: Korean War military psychiatrists, the popular theories of William Sargant and the field of experimental research known broadly as sensory deprivation. It concludes with some observations about current concerns about psychological manipulation in the digital age and the role psychology expertise plays in navigating these concerns."

        "Author": "Changnian Han",
        "Abstract": "We developed a novel data-driven Artificial Intelligence-enhanced Adaptive Time Stepping algorithm (AI-ATS) that can adapt timestep sizes to underlying biophysical dynamics. We demonstrated its values in solving a complex biophysical problem, at multiple spatiotemporal scales, that describes platelet dynamics in shear blood flow. In order to achieve a significant speedup of this computationally demanding problem, we integrated a framework of novel AI algorithms into the solution of the platelet dynamics equations. Our framework involves recurrent neural network-based autoencoders by the Long Short-Term Memory and the Gated Recurrent Units as the first step for memorizing the dynamic states in long-term dependencies for the input time series, followed by two fully-connected neural networks to optimize timestep sizes and step jumps. The computational efficiency of our AI-ATS is underscored by assessing the accuracy and speed of a multiscale simulation of the platelet with the standard time stepping algorithm (STS). By adapting the timestep size, our AI-ATS guides the omission of multiple redundant time steps without sacrificing significant accuracy of the dynamics. Compared to the STS, our AI-ATS achieved a reduction of 40% unnecessary calculations while bounding the errors of mechanical and thermodynamic properties to 3%."

        "Author": "Neha Taneja",
        "Abstract": "Introduction: Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to understand and manage our own feelings and of others. It has emerged as one of the vital elements of success and interpersonal relations in everyday life. There are individual differences of EI depending on characteristics and behaviors of an individual, which determines their personality. Aims and objectives: The present study assesses the EI and personality traits of medical students and determines the relationship of EI with personality traits of the medical students. Materials and methods: This was a cross-sectional study and was conducted among students of a government medical college, located in New Delhi. A total of 210 participants were included in the study. After obtaining written informed consent from all participants, a questionnaire consisting of demographic information, Ten-Item Personality Inventory and Schutte EI Scale, was administered. The means and proportions were calculated. Chi-square test and Pearson's correlation test were used to test significance. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The mean (standard deviation) age of the study participants was 21.54 (±1.98) years. The majority (65.7%) of the students were male. 51% of the students had moderate EI, and high EI was seen in 49% of the students. A positive and significant relationship between personality traits and EI was found in the study. Conclusion: Personality traits and EI are related to one another and could influence student academic achievement. Since EI influences academic performance so personality trait assessment and empathic perceptions exploration can facilitate to aid the academic performance of the students."

        "Author": "Lin Shui",
        "Abstract": "With the rapid development of new technologies, including artificial intelligence and genome sequencing, radiogenomics has emerged as a state-of-the-art science in the field of individualized medicine. Radiogenomics combines a large volume of quantitative data extracted from medical images with individual genomic phenotypes and constructs a prediction model through deep learning to stratify patients, guide therapeutic strategies, and evaluate clinical outcomes. Recent studies of various types of tumors demonstrate the predictive value of radiogenomics. And some of the issues in the radiogenomic analysis and the solutions from prior works are presented. Although the workflow criteria and international agreed guidelines for statistical methods need to be confirmed, radiogenomics represents a repeatable and cost-effective approach for the detection of continuous changes and is a promising surrogate for invasive interventions. Therefore, radiogenomics could facilitate computer-aided diagnosis, treatment, and prediction of the prognosis in patients with tumors in the routine clinical setting. Here, we summarize the integrated process of radiogenomics and introduce the crucial strategies and statistical algorithms involved in current studies."

        "Abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) nowadays can match human performance in challenging complex tasks, but it remains unknown whether DCNNs achieve human-like performance through human-like processes. Here we applied a reverse-correlation method to make explicit representations of DCNNs and humans when performing face gender classification. We found that humans and a typical DCNN, VGG-Face, used similar critical information for this task, which mainly resided at low spatial frequencies. Importantly, the prior task experience, which the VGG-Face was pre-trained to process faces at the subordinate level (i.e., identification) as humans do, seemed necessary for such representational similarity, because AlexNet, a DCNN pre-trained to process objects at the basic level (i.e., categorization), succeeded in gender classification but relied on a completely different representation. In sum, although DCNNs and humans rely on different sets of hardware to process faces, they can use a similar and implementation-independent representation to achieve the same computation goal."

        "Abstract": "Objectives: We investigated hippocampal-sparing lesionectomy (HSL) outcomes in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and the significance of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) detected by hippocampography in HSL. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data from patients who underwent HSL for lesional TLE. Patients were included when MRI confirmed (i) a lesion limited to the temporal lobe with normal hippocampi preoperatively and (ii) hippocampal integrity postoperatively. Factors possibly related to outcomes were collected. Intraoperative hippocampography was reviewed, and spikes, ripples, and fast ripples were marked. Seizure outcomes were tracked ≥ 2 years. Postoperative neuropsychological tests were performed and analyzed. Results: We included 67 patients (35 males/32 females, median age at surgery 28 years, 57 seizure-free). Complete resection was significantly associated with being seizure-free without aura, an outcome achieved by 32 (69.6%) patients with complete resection vs 1 (12.5%) with incomplete resection (p = 0.004). Spikes/ripples/fast ripples appeared frequently in the hippocampus, occurring in 86.4%/82.4%/75.0% of cases before resection and 76.7%/78.1%/63.0% after resection. The presence and rate were unconnected to seizure outcome. Postoperative neuropsychological outcomes in intelligence and visual memory improved overall. Conclusions: HSL in lesional TLE can produce satisfactory seizure and cognitive outcomes. Intraoperative hippocampography-guided resection of apparently normal hippocampi should be performed cautiously and might not be necessary. Significance: This study provided evidence in decision making for patients with lesional TLE with a radiologically normal hippocampus."

        "Author": "Gisella Baglio",
        "Abstract": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) are associated with an increased risk of cerebral, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes, and vulnerability to develop a Borderline Intellectual Functioning (BIF). BIF is characterized by an intelligence quotient (IQ) in the range 70-85, poor executive functioning, difficulties in emotion processing, and motor competencies. All these difficulties can lead to mental and/or neurodevelopmental disorders that require long-term care. Accordingly, we developed an intensive and multidomain rehabilitation program for children with ACE and BIF, termed the Movement Cognition and Narration of emotions Treatment (MCNT1.0). The efficacy of MCNT1.0 on cognitive and social functioning was demonstrated with a previously reported randomized controlled trial (RCT). To extend the impact of the treatment also to the motor domain a new version, called MCNT2.0, was implemented. The present study aims to verify the feasibility of MCNT2.0 and its effects on the motor domain. A quasi-experimental approach was used in which a group of 18 children with ACE and BIF were consecutively recruited and participated in the MCNT 2.0 program. Participants were compared with the MCNT1.0 group as an active comparator, using the dataset of the RCT. The two groups received a full evaluation comprising: the Wechsler Intelligent Scale for Children-IV (WISC-IV), the Movement-ABC (M-ABC), the Test of Gross Motor Development (TGMD), the Social Skills from Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scale-II (VABS-II) and the Child Behavior Check List 6-18 (CBCL). An ANCOVA was carried out on changes in the scale scores from baseline with age and baseline score as covariates. Results showed a mean adherence to treatment of 0.85 (sd = 0.07), with no differences between groups in IQ, and Social Skills changes, while greater improvements for motor abilities were shown in the MCNT 2.0 group: M-ABC (p = 0.002), and TGMD (p = 0.002). Finally, greater improvement in the CBCL scale was observed in the MCNT 1.0 group (p = 0.002). Results indicate that due to its positive effects on cognitive, social participation and motor domains, MCNT2.0 may represent a protective factor against maladaptive outcomes of children with ACE and BIF."

This systematic review aimed to report on the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) applications designed for endodontic diagnosis, decision-making, and prediction of prognosis. Materials and methods: Studies reporting on AI applications in endodontics were identified from the electronic databases such as PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science, for original research articles published from January 1, 2000, to June 1, 2020. A total of 10 studies that met our eligibility criteria were further analyzed for qualitative data. QUADAS-2 was applied for synthesis of the quality of the studies included. Results: A wide range of AI applications have been implemented in endodontics. The neural networks employed were mostly based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) in their neural architectures. These AI models have been used for locating apical foramen, retreatment predictions, prediction of periapical pathologies, detection and diagnosis of vertical root fractures, and assessment of root morphologies. Conclusion: These studies suggest that the neural networks performed similar to the experienced professionals in terms of accuracy and precision. In some studies, these models have even outperformed the specialists. Clinical significance: These models can be of greater assistance as an expert opinion for less experienced and nonspecialists."

        "Abstract": "\"A ship in the harbour is safe, but that is not what ships are built for,\" observed that sage 19th century philosopher William Shedd. In other words, technology of high potential is of little value if the potential is not exploited. As the shape of 2020 is increasingly defined by the coronavirus pandemic, digitalisation is like a ship loaded with technology that has a huge capacity for transforming mankind's combat against infectious disease. But it is still moored safely in harbour. Instead of sailing bravely into battle, it remains at the dockside, cowering from the storm beyond the breakwaters. Engineers and fitters constantly fine-tune it, and its officers and deckhands perfect their operating procedures, but that promise is unfulfilled, restrained by the hesitancy and indecision of officialdom. Out there, the seas of the pandemic are turbulent and uncharted, and it is impossible to know in advance everything of the other dangers that may lurk beyond those cloudy horizons. However, the more noble course is for orders to be given to complete the preparations, to cast off and set sail, and to join other vessels crewed by valiant healthcare workers and tireless researchers, already deeply engaged in a rescue mission for the whole of the human race. It is the destiny of digitalisation to navigate those oceans alongside other members of that task force, and the hour of destiny has arrived. This article focuses on the potential enablers and recommendation to maximise learnings during the era of COVID-19."

        "Author": "Giovanni Coticchio",
        "Abstract": "Research question: Can artificial intelligence and advanced image analysis extract and harness novel information derived from cytoplasmic movements of the early human embryo to predict development to blastocyst? Design: In a proof-of-principle study, 230 human preimplantation embryos were retrospectively assessed using an artificial neural network. After intracytoplasmic sperm injection, embryos underwent time-lapse monitoring for 44 h. For comparison, standard embryo assessment of each embryo by a single embryologist was carried out to predict development to blastocyst stage based on a single picture frame taken at 42 h of development. In the experimental approach, in embryos that developed to blastocyst or destined to arrest, cytoplasm movement velocity was recorded by time-lapse monitoring during the first 44 h of culture and analysed with a Particle Image Velocimetry algorithm to extract quantitative information. Three main artificial intelligence approaches, the k-Nearest Neighbour, the Long-Short Term Memory Neural Network and the hybrid ensemble classifier were used to classify the embryos. Results: Blind operator assessment classified each embryo in terms of ability to develop to blastocyst, with 75.4% accuracy, 76.5% sensitivity, 74.3% specificity, 74.3% precision and 75.4% F1 score. Integration of results from artificial intelligence models with the blind operator classification, resulted in 82.6% accuracy, 79.4% sensitivity, 85.7% specificity, 84.4% precision and 81.8% F1 score. Conclusions: The present study suggests the possibility of predicting human blastocyst development at early cleavage stages by detection of cytoplasm movement velocity and artificial intelligence analysis. This indicates the importance of the dynamics of the cytoplasm as a novel and valuable source of data to assess embryo viability."

The machine learning (ML) algorithm possesses unique advantages in the evaluation of large datasets. We investigated the utility of ML algorithms for developing an artificial intelligence (AI) autoverification system to support laboratory testing. The accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm model were also validated. Methods: Testing data, including 52 testing items with demographic information, were extracted from the laboratory information system and Roche Cobas® IT 3000 from June 1, 2018 to August 30, 2019. Two rounds of modeling were conducted to train different ML algorithms and test their abilities to distinguish invalid reports. Algorithms with the top three best performances were selected to form the finalized ensemble model. Double-blind testing between experienced laboratory personnel and the AI autoverification system was conducted, and the passing rate and false-negative rate (FNR) were documented. The working efficiency and workload reduction were also analyzed. Results: The final AI system showed a 89.60% passing rate and 0.95 per mille FNR, in double-blind testing. The AI system lowered the number of invalid reports by approximately 80% compared to those evaluated by a rule-based engine, and therefore enhanced the working efficiency and reduced the workload in the biochemistry laboratory. Conclusions: We confirmed the feasibility of the ML algorithm for autoverification with high accuracy and efficiency."

        "Abstract": "Purpose: To develop and validate a deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithm for detecting abnormalities in fundus images from non-mydriatic fundus photography examinations. Methods: A total of 1295 fundus images were collected to develop and validate a DTL algorithm for detecting abnormal fundus images. After removing 366 poor images, the DTL model was developed using 929 (370 normal and 559 abnormal) fundus images. Data preprocessing was performed to normalize the images. The inception-ResNet-v2 architecture was applied to achieve transfer learning. We tested our model using a subset of the publicly available Messidor dataset (using 366 images) and evaluated the testing performance of the DTL model for detecting abnormal fundus images. Results: In the internal validation dataset (n = 273 images), the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity of DTL for correctly classified fundus images were 0.997%, 97.41%, 97.07%, and 96.82%, respectively. For the test dataset (n = 273 images), the AUC, sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity of the DTL for correctly classifying fundus images were 0.926%, 88.17%, 87.18%, and 86.67%, respectively. Conclusion: DTL showed high sensitivity and specificity for detecting abnormal fundus-related diseases. Further research is necessary to improve this method and evaluate the applicability of DTL in community health-care centers."

The study aimed at improving executive functioning and visuo-spatial skills with an evidence-based training focused on working memory in children with pSD. The intervention study followed a stepped wedge design. 19 children with pSD (11 female and 8 male; age range: 4;1-13;1 years), mild to moderate upper limb impairment and Verbal Intelligence Quotient (VIQ) >80 participated to the study. The children were trained with a home-based adaptive working memory training (CogMed®) over a 5-week period. The primary outcome measure was the CogMed Improvement index; pre- and post-test explorative neuropsychological assessment was conducted with a subset of tests from the NEPSY-II battery. Working memory training in children with pSD significantly improved trained working memory abilities (CogMed indices) as well as non-trained skills, such as visuo-spatial skills, inhibition of automatic responses and phonological processing. The results suggest that standard rehabilitation schedules for children with pSD should be integrated with trainings on executive functions."

        "Title": "Revisited: Pigeons Have Much Cognitive Behavior in Common With Humans",
        "Author": "Thomas R Zentall",
        "Abstract": "The hypothesis proposed by Macphail (1987) is that differences in intelligent behavior thought to distinguish different species were likely attributed to differences in the context of the tasks being used. Once one corrects for differences in sensory input, motor output, and incentive, it is likely that all vertebrate animals have comparable intellectual abilities. In the present article I suggest a number of tests of this hypothesis with pigeons. In each case, the evidence suggests that either there is evidence for the cognitive behavior, or the pigeons suffer from biases similar to those of humans. Thus, Macphail's hypothesis offers a challenge to researchers to find the appropriate conditions to bring out in the animal the cognitive ability being tested."

        "Author": "Lei Meng",
        "Abstract": "To improve the personalized service of cultural tourism, anticipatory calculation has become an essential technology in the content design of intelligence navigation system. Culture tourism, as a form of leisure activity, is being favored by an increasing number of people, which calls for further improvements in the cultural consumption experience. An important component of cultural tourism is for tourists to experience intangible cultural heritage projects with local characteristics. However, from the perspective of user needs and the content adaptive system, there are few suitable intelligent navigation and user demand anticipatory systems for intangible cultural heritage content. Purple clay culture is one of the first batches of national intangible cultural heritage protection projects in China. Therefore, taking purple clay culture exhibition as an example, this paper attempts to analyze the personalized information demand of tourism consumption experience in intangible cultural heritage communication activities with affective computing and meaning-driven innovative design method, by taking the content design in the navigation system as the research object. This paper uses the theory of planned behavior to calculate the relationship between tourists' attitude, experience behavior, and display information demand. The findings indicate two issues. First, tourists' demand for the entertainment and leisure attributes of intangible cultural heritage is greater than the demand for educational function attributes. Second, the meaning elements of information can change tourists' beliefs in intangible cultural heritage and affect their attitude and behavior toward such heritage. According to the research results, strengthening the meaning elements of specific group information can improve people's cultural identity and tourism satisfaction. The research results provide the basis for the content design direction of future museum intelligent navigation systems."

        "Author": "Dorota Daniela Szczygiel",
        "Abstract": "This study contributes to the constantly accumulating evidence on the effects of customer incivility (CI) on service employee exhaustion. Previous research has demonstrated that surface acting (SA) acts as a mediating variable in the relationship between CI and exhaustion. This study extended prior findings in two ways. The results of Study 1 (315 retail sales employees, 62.2% female) demonstrated that SA mediates the positive relationship between CI and exhaustion while controlling for employees' trait positive and negative affectivity (NA). The results of Study 2 (292 customer service representatives, 51% female) supported a moderated mediation model demonstrating that trait emotional intelligence (EI) buffers the direct and indirect (through SA) effects of CI on exhaustion. Specifically, it was found that employees exposed to many uncivil customer behaviors but high in trait EI reported using less SA and, thus, experienced fewer exhaustion symptoms than their low in trait EI counterparts. These results highlight EI as an important personal resource that mitigates the adverse effects of CI on service employees' exhaustion, and suggest that organizations should consider implementing EI training programmes for their frontline service employees."

        "Author": "Stéphane Mouchabac",
        "Abstract": "The patient's decision-making abilities are often altered in psychiatric disorders. The legal framework of psychiatric advance directives (PADs) has been made to provide care to patients in these situations while respecting their free and informed consent. The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) within Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) may result in improvements for complex decisions that are often made in situations covered by PADs. Still, it raises theoretical and ethical issues this paper aims to address. First, it goes through every level of possible intervention of AI in the PAD drafting process, beginning with what data sources it could access and if its data processing competencies should be limited, then treating of the opportune moments it should be used and its place in the contractual relationship between each party (patient, caregivers, and trusted person). Second, it focuses on ethical principles and how these principles, whether they are medical principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice) applied to AI or AI principles (loyalty and vigilance) applied to medicine, should be taken into account in the future of the PAD drafting process. Some general guidelines are proposed in conclusion: AI must remain a decision support system as a partner of each party of the PAD contract; patients should be able to choose a personalized type of AI intervention or no AI intervention at all; they should stay informed, i.e., understand the functioning and relevance of AI thanks to educational programs; finally, a committee should be created for ensuring the principle of vigilance by auditing these new tools in terms of successes, failures, security, and relevance."

        "Abstract": "Deficiencies of many nutrients in pregnancy have adverse effects on fetal brain development with consequent impaired cognitive function in childhood. However, it is unclear whether deficiencies of vitamin B12 prenatally are harmful to the developing fetus. We therefore used the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to test the hypothesis that cognitive outcomes in childhood are reduced if their mothers consumed a diet low in vitamin B12 during pregnancy. A detailed exposome analysis was used to identify 9 factors independently associated with low vitamin B12 intake. These were taken into account in each of 26 outcome analyses. Results showed that the children of women with the lowest 10% intake of B12 were at increased risk of poor vocabulary at 24 months, reduced ability at combining words at 38 months, poor speech intelligibility at 6 years, poor mathematics comprehension at school years 4 and 6 (ages 8-9 and 10-11 years), and poor results on the national mathematics tests (age 13). There were no such significant adjusted associations for reading or spelling abilities, or for verbal or full-scale IQ (Intelligence Quotient) at 8 or at 15. Thus, we have confirmed that there are adverse effects on the child's development if the pregnant woman has a low intake of vitamin B12, and we have shown that these are specific to certain speech and mathematical abilities."

        "Author": "Naveen L Pereira",
        "Abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by heterogeneity in susceptibility to the disease and severity of illness. Understanding inter-individual variation has important implications for not only allocation of resources but also targeting patients for escalation of care, inclusion in clinical trials, and individualized medical therapy including vaccination. In addition to geographic location and social vulnerability, there are clear biological differences such as age, sex, race, presence of comorbidities, underlying genetic variation, and differential immune response that contribute to variability in disease manifestation. These differences may have implications for precision medicine. Specific examples include the observation that androgens regulate the expression of the enzyme transmembrane protease, serine 2 which facilitates severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral entry into the cell; therefore, androgen deprivation therapy is being explored as a treatment option in males infected with COVID-19. An immunophenotyping study of COVID-19 patients has shown that a subset develop T cytopenia which has prompted a clinical trial that is testing the efficacy of interleukin-7 in these patients. Predicting which COVID-19 patients will develop progressive disease that will require hospitalization has important implications for clinical trials that target outpatients. Enrollment of patients at low risk for progression of disease and hospitalization would likely not result in such therapy demonstrating efficacy. There are efforts to use artificial intelligence to integrate digital data from smartwatch applications or digital monitoring systems and biological data to enable identification of the high risk COVID-19 patient. The ultimate goal of precision medicine using such modern technology is to recognize individual differences to improve health for all."

        "Abstract": "Background: Over the next 25 years, the global prevalence of diabetes is expected to grow to affect 700 million individuals. Consequently, an unprecedented number of patients will be at risk for vision loss from diabetic eye disease. This demand will almost certainly exceed the supply of eye care professionals to individually evaluate each patient on an annual basis, signaling the need for 21st century tools to assist our profession in meeting this challenge. Methods: Review of available literature on artificial intelligence (AI) as applied to diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection and predictionResults: The field of AI has seen exponential growth in evaluating fundus photographs for DR. AI systems employ machine learning and artificial neural networks to teach themselves how to grade DR from libraries of tens of thousands of images and may be able to predict future DR progression based on baseline fundus photographs. Conclusions: AI algorithms are highly promising for the purposes of DR detection and will likely be able to reliably predict DR worsening in the future. A deeper understanding of these systems and how they interpret images is critical as they transition from the bench into the clinic."

Thus, designers have typically considered these embodiments to be broadly interchangeable, and the choice of embodiment primarily depends on the practical demands of an application. This paper makes the case that virtual and physical embodiments elicit fundamentally different \"frames of mind\" in the users of the technology and follow different metaphors for interaction, resulting in diverging expectations, forms of engagement, and eventually interaction outcomes. It illustrates these differences through the lens of five key mechanisms: \"situativity, interactivity, agency, proxemics, and believability\". It also outlines the design implications of the two frames of mind, arguing for different domains of interaction serving as appropriate context for virtual and physical embodiments."

        "Abstract": "Background: It is not only important for counseling purposes and for healthcare management. This study investigates the prediction accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach and a linear model. The heuristic expecting 1 day of stay per percentage of total body surface area (TBSA) serves as the performance benchmark. Methods: The study is based on pediatric burn patient's data sets from an international burn registry (N = 8,542). Mean absolute error and standard error are calculated for each prediction model (rule of thumb, linear regression, and random forest). Factors contributing to a prolonged stay and the relationship between TBSA and the residual error are analyzed. Results: The random forest-based approach and the linear model are statistically superior to the rule of thumb (p < 0.001, resp. p = 0.009). The residual error rises as TBSA increases for all methods. Factors associated with a prolonged LOS are particularly TBSA, depth of burn, and inhalation trauma. Conclusion: Applying AI-based algorithms to data from large international registries constitutes a promising tool for the purpose of prediction in medicine in the future; however, certain prerequisites concerning the underlying data sets and certain shortcomings must be considered."

        "Author": "Sergey A Shuvaev",
        "Abstract": "Animals rely on internal motivational states to make decisions. The role of motivational salience in decision making is in early stages of mathematical understanding. Here, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that relies on neural networks to learn optimal ongoing behavior for dynamically changing motivation values. First, we show that neural networks implementing Q-learning with motivational salience can navigate in environment with dynamic rewards without adjustments in synaptic strengths when the needs of an agent shift. In this setting, our networks may display elements of addictive behaviors. Second, we use a similar framework in hierarchical manager-agent system to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm with motivation that both infers motivational states and behaves. Finally, we show that, when trained in the Pavlovian conditioning setting, the responses of the neurons in our model resemble previously published neuronal recordings in the ventral pallidum, a basal ganglia structure involved in motivated behaviors. We conclude that motivation allows Q-learning networks to quickly adapt their behavior to conditions when expected reward is modulated by agent's dynamic needs. Our approach addresses the algorithmic rationale of motivation and makes a step toward better interpretability of behavioral data via inference of motivational dynamics in the brain."

        "Author": "Agata Blasiak",
        "Abstract": "The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) led to multiple drug repurposing clinical trials that have yielded largely uncertain outcomes. To overcome this challenge, we used IDentif.AI, a platform that pairs experimental validation with artificial intelligence (AI) and digital drug development to rapidly pinpoint unpredictable drug interactions and optimize infectious disease combination therapy design with clinically relevant dosages. IDentif.AI was paired with a 12-drug candidate therapy set representing over 530,000 drug combinations against the SARS-CoV-2 live virus collected from a patient sample. IDentif.AI pinpointed the optimal combination as remdesivir, ritonavir, and lopinavir, which was experimentally validated to mediate a 6.5-fold enhanced efficacy over remdesivir alone. Additionally, it showed hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to be relatively ineffective. The study was completed within 2 weeks, with a three-order of magnitude reduction in the number of tests needed. IDentif.AI independently mirrored clinical trial outcomes to date without any data from these trials. The robustness of this digital drug development approach paired with in vitro experimentation and AI-driven optimization suggests that IDentif.AI may be clinically actionable toward current and future outbreaks."

        "Author": "Joanna Piekarska",
        "Abstract": "The aim of the current study was to examine the explanatory power of personality traits, emotional abilities, trait emotional intelligence, self-efficacy, and self-esteem in predicting perceived stress in adolescents. The data were collected from 406 high school students, aged 18-22 years (Mage = 18.47, SD = 0.64). Perceived stress was assessed with the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Personality traits were measured with the Eysenck Personality Short Scale (EPQ-R-S), emotional abilities were assessed with two performance tests, the Emotional Intelligence Scale - Faces (SIE-T), and the Emotion Understanding Test (TRE), and trait emotional intelligence was measured with a selfreport questionnaire (the Schutte Emotional Intelligence Scale, SEIS). The Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) were also used. Results indicate that the strongest determinant of perceived stress in adolescents was high neuroticism. Perceived stress was also determined by low self-efficacy and self-esteem, as well as high extraversion and psychoticism. Women reported higher perceived stress than men. There also were differences in the determinants of perceived stress between graduate and nongraduate students. The obtained results suggest that the development of high self-esteem and high self-efficacy may contribute to perceptions of lower stress in adolescents and may be especially valuable for neurotic individuals and for women, who are more exposed to stress."

        "Author": "Rocio Guil",
        "Abstract": "Nowadays, students are experiencing difficult and stressful situations due to the Global Pandemic Alert. This changing world can evoke negative emotions that have been traditionally linked to higher anxiety. Researches have been focused on the positive outcomes of trait emotional intelligence (TEI) preventing psychological disorders. However, the possibility that TEI might have a dark side has been neglected. Hence, this study aimed to explore the mediating effect of the three dimensions of TEI in the relationship between negative affect and anxiety symptoms among college students. Participants of this research were 467 undergraduates who completed an online self-reported questionnaire including the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson et al., 1988), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger et al., 1970), and Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24, Salovey et al., 1995). The global serial mediation model showed that the total amount of variance explained by the global model was 30.8% (R 2 = 0.31). Negative affectivity and age accounted for the 15.1% of state anxiety variance (R 2 = 0.15; c: B = 0.63, p < 0.001) while 15.7% of the variance of state anxiety was attributed to the direct or indirect effect of the three dimensions of TEI (R 2 = 0.16). Five indirect effects presented statistical significance (95% BootCI). The contrast analyses between mediators showed that three indirect effects had higher statistical weigh; the ability of negative affect to increase state anxiety through (i) emotional attention; (ii) emotional clarity, and (iii) serially through emotional clarity and mood repair. Our results indicated that students' negative emotions lead to higher emotional attention which in turn may enhance state anxiety in two ways: by a direct effect of emotional attention on state anxiety and by a serial effect through emotional clarity. Moreover, when negative affect is associated with lower emotional clarity, anxiety symptoms may also arise. However, when attention and clarity are connected, the negative effect is reversed into a positive one, decreasing state anxiety."

        "Abstract": "Since first being tracked in China in late 2019, the effects of the COVID-19 coronavirus have shaped global patterns of morbidity and mortality, as well as exposed the strengths and limitations of health care systems and social safety nets. Without question, reporting of its impact has been bolstered in large part through near real-time daily mapping of cases and fatalities. Though these maps serve as an effective political and social tool in communicating disease impact, most visualizations largely over-emphasize their usefulness for tracking disease progression and appropriate responses. Messy and inconsistent health data are a big part of this problem, as is a paucity of high-resolution spatial data to monitor health outcomes. Another issue is that the ease of producing out-of-the box products largely out paces the response to the core challenges inherent in the poor quality of most geo-referenced data. Adopting a GIScience approach, and in particular, making use of location-based intelligence tools, can improve the shortcomings in data reporting and more accurately reveal how COVID-19 will have a long-term impact on global health."

        "Author": "Faisal Mehmood Butt",
        "Abstract": "An efficient management and better scheduling by the power companies are of great significance for accurate electrical load forecasting. There exists a high level of uncertainties in the load time series, which is challenging to make the accurate short-term load forecast (STLF), medium-term load forecast (MTLF), and long-term load forecast (LTLF). To extract the local trends and to capture the same patterns of short, and medium forecasting time series, we proposed long short-term memory (LSTM), Multilayer perceptron, and convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the relationship in the time series. These models are proposed to improve the forecasting accuracy. The models were tested based on the real-world case by conducting detailed experiments to validate their stability and practicality. The performance was measured in terms of squared error, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To predict the next 24 hours ahead load forecasting, the lowest prediction error was obtained using LSTM with R2 (0.5160), MLP with MAPE (4.97), MAE (104.33) and RMSE (133.92). To predict the next 72 hours ahead of load forecasting, the lowest prediction error was obtained using LSTM with R2 (0.7153), MPL with MAPE (7.04), MAE (125.92), RMSE (188.33). Likewise, to predict the next one week ahead load forecasting, the lowest error was obtained using CNN with R2 (0.7616), MLP with MAPE (6.162), MAE (103.156), RMSE (150.81). Moreover, to predict the next one-month load forecasting, the lowest prediction error was obtained using CNN with R2 (0.820), MLP with MAPE (5.18), LSTM with MAE (75.12) and RMSE (109.197). The results reveal that proposed methods achieved better and stable performance for predicting the short, and medium-term load forecasting. The findings of the STLF indicate that the proposed model can be better implemented for local system planning and dispatch, while it will be more efficient for MTLF in better scheduling and maintenance operations."

        "Author": "Philipp Lohmann",
        "Abstract": "Radiomics allows the extraction of quantitative features from medical images such as CT, MRI, or PET, thereby providing additional, potentially relevant diagnostic information for clinical decision-making. Because the computation of these features is performed highly automated on medical images acquired during routine follow-up, radiomics offers this information at low cost. Further, the radiomics features can be used alone or combined with other clinical or histomolecular parameters to generate predictive or prognostic mathematical models. These models can then be applied for various important diagnostic indications in neuro-oncology, for example, to noninvasively predict relevant biomarkers in glioma patients, to differentiate between treatment-related changes and local brain tumor relapse, or to predict treatment response. In recent years, amino acid PET has become an important diagnostic tool in patients with brain tumors. Therefore, the number of studies in patients with brain tumors investigating the potential of PET radiomics or combined PET/MRI radiomics is steadily increasing. This review summarizes current research regarding feature-based PET as well as combined PET/MRI radiomics in neuro-oncology."

        "Author": "Christopher Predel",
        "Abstract": "Background: Atrial fibrillation is the most common persistent arrhythmia. It is associated with increased mortality and morbidity such as stroke. The early detection of atrial fibrillation can significantly reduce the risk of stroke through preventive anticoagulation. Smartwatches offer the opportunity to screen for atrial fibrillation in the general population. This paper aims to analyze the ethical challenges associated with screening for atrial fibrillation using smartwatches. Methods: This is an ethical analysis. The methodology is based on the principle-orientated approach of Beauchamp and Childress. The principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and autonomy have to be guaranteed given the influence of private companies, privacy protection, liability and doctor-patient-relationship. The work is based on a systematic literature research. Results: There is currently no evidence that screening for atrial fibrillation with smartwatches improves the outcome and reduces the number of adverse events. The high number of false-positive results can lead to harm. The principle of non-maleficence is violated. The over-reliance on and the lack of adequate education by smartwatches can worsen the doctor-patient relationship. However, the relationship can also be improved by the proactive participation of the patient, which leads to greater autonomy, compliance and in the end beneficence. Since smartwatches are consumer goods, there is a risk for greater disparities in the poor and rich population. There is also a risk of discrimination against ethnic minorities due to underrepresentation in training data and study cohorts. The principle of justice is violated. The storage of sensitive medical data by private companies also raises many ethical and legal concerns. Conclusion: This analysis has shown that the use of smartwatches to detect atrial fibrillation is currently in an ethical perspective problematic. The lack of evidence and the high number of false-positive results can lead to harm. As smartwatches provide only little information about the possible consequences, informed consent cannot be assumed. Ethical implementation could be archived if doctors provide smartwatches to patients who have been shown to benefit from them. The implementation and education should be managed by the doctor."

Methods: In this parallel randomized controlled trial, participants were randomly assigned to either the stress management group (n=40; relaxation breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery) or in the Pythagorean Self awareness group (n=41). Self-reported validated measures were used to evaluate perceived stress, health locus of control, anxiety and depression. Results: All groups were found with significantly better cognitive speed and verbal memory at the end of the follow-up. Taking into account the group by time interaction coefficients, PSAT was found significantly superior to standard SM with regards to depression, emotional intelligence, lifestyle and personal control and verbal memory suggesting that verbal memory improvement through time should be mostly attributed to PSAT. On the other hand, the cognitive speed improvement during follow-up should be attributed to both interventions. Conclusions: These findings provide important insight into the role of stress management. Future studies should focus on randomized, controlled trials with larger samples and longer follow-up times."

        "Abstract": "The main objective of this paper is to further improve the current time-series prediction (forecasting) algorithms based on hybrids between machine learning and nature-inspired algorithms. After the recent COVID-19 outbreak, almost all countries were forced to impose strict measures and regulations in order to control the virus spread. Predicting the number of new cases is crucial when evaluating which measures should be implemented. The improved forecasting approach was then used to predict the number of the COVID-19 cases. The proposed prediction model represents a hybridized approach between machine learning, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and enhanced beetle antennae search swarm intelligence metaheuristics. The enhanced beetle antennae search is utilized to determine the parameters of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and to improve the overall performance of the prediction model. First, an enhanced beetle antennae search algorithm has been implemented that overcomes deficiencies of its original version. The enhanced algorithm was tested and validated against a wider set of benchmark functions and proved that it substantially outperforms original implementation. Afterwards, the proposed hybrid method for COVID-19 cases prediction was then evaluated using the World Health Organization's official data on the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The proposed method has been compared against several existing state-of-the-art approaches that were tested on the same datasets. The proposed CESBAS-ANFIS achieved R 2 score of 0.9763, which is relatively high when compared to the R 2 value of 0.9645, achieved by FPASSA-ANFIS. To further evaluate the robustness of the proposed method, it has also been validated against two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in China and the USA. Simulation results and the comparative analysis show that the proposed hybrid method managed to outscore other sophisticated approaches that were tested on the same datasets and proved to be a useful tool for time-series prediction."

        "Abstract": "Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is occurred with increasing incidence and heterogeneous pathogenesis. Although clinical strategies are accumulated for PCa prevention, there is still a lack of sensitive biomarkers for the holistic management in PCa occurrence and progression. Based on systems biology and artificial intelligence, translational informatics provides new perspectives for PCa biomarker prioritization and carcinogenic survey. Methods: In this study, gene expression and miRNA-mRNA association data were integrated to construct conditional networks specific to PCa occurrence and progression, respectively. Based on network modeling, hub miRNAs with significantly strong single-line regulatory power were topologically identified and those shared by the condition-specific network systems were chosen as candidate biomarkers for computational validation and functional enrichment analysis. Results: Nine miRNAs, i.e., hsa-miR-1-3p, hsa-miR-125b-5p, hsa-miR-145-5p, hsa-miR-182-5p, hsa-miR-198, hsa-miR-22-3p, hsa-miR-24-3p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, and hsa-miR-499a-5p, were prioritized as key players for PCa management. Most of these miRNAs achieved high AUC values (AUC > 0.70) in differentiating different prostate samples. Among them, seven of the miRNAs have been previously reported as PCa biomarkers, which indicated the performance of the proposed model. The remaining hsa-miR-22-3p and hsa-miR-499a-5p could serve as novel candidates for PCa predicting and monitoring. In particular, key miRNA-mRNA regulations were extracted for pathogenetic understanding. Here hsa-miR-145-5p was selected as the case and hsa-miR-145-5p/NDRG2/AR and hsa-miR-145-5p/KLF5/AR axis were found to be putative mechanisms during PCa evolution. In addition, Wnt signaling, prostate cancer, microRNAs in cancer etc. were significantly enriched by the identified miRNAs-mRNAs, demonstrating the functional role of the identified miRNAs in PCa genesis. Conclusion: Biomarker miRNAs together with the associated miRNA-mRNA relations were computationally identified and analyzed for PCa management and carcinogenic deciphering. Further experimental and clinical validations using low-throughput techniques and human samples are expected for future translational studies."

        "Author": "Rahul Tyagi",
        "Abstract": "Background: Neuropsychological profile of Indian Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) subjects remains unidentified and needs to be evaluated. Methods: A total of 69 DMD and 66 controls were subjected to detailed intelligence and neuropsychological assessment. The factor indexes were derived from various components of Malin's Intelligence Scale for Indian Children (MISIC) and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Results: Poor verbal and visual memory profiles were demonstrated by DMDs, which include RAVLT-immediate recall (IR) (p = 0.042), RAVLT-delayed recall (DR) (p = 0.009), Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test (RCFT)-IR (p = 0.001), and RCFT-DR (p = 0.001). RAVLT-memory efficiency index demonstrated poor verbal memory efficiency (p = 0.008). Significant differences in the functioning of working memory axis [RAVLT T1 (p = 0.015), recency T1 (p = 0.004), Digit Span Backward (p = 0.103)] were observed along with reduced performance in visuomotor coordination, visuospatial, and visual recognition abilities. Block designing efficiency index and attention fraction showed a normal performance in DMD kids. Conclusion: Working memory deficits were found to be the crucial element of cognitive functioning in DMD cases. Working memory interventions may be beneficial to improve the neuropsychological profile in DMD."

        "Author": "Maurizio Sessa",
        "Abstract": "Aim: To summarize the evidence on the performance of artificial intelligence vs. traditional pharmacoepidemiological techniques. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE (01/1950 to 05/2019) was searched to identify observational studies, meta-analyses, and clinical trials using artificial intelligence techniques having a drug as the exposure or the outcome of the study. Only studies with an available full text in the English language were evaluated. Results: In all, 72 original articles and five reviews were identified via Ovid MEDLINE of which 19 (26.4%) compared the performance of artificial intelligence techniques with traditional pharmacoepidemiological methods. In total, 44 comparisons have been performed in articles that aimed at 1) predicting the needed dosage given the patient's characteristics (31.8%), 2) predicting the clinical response following a pharmacological treatment (29.5%), 3) predicting the occurrence/severity of adverse drug reactions (20.5%), 4) predicting the propensity score (9.1%), 5) identifying subpopulation more at risk of drug inefficacy (4.5%), 6) predicting drug consumption (2.3%), and 7) predicting drug-induced lengths of stay in hospital (2.3%). In 22 out of 44 (50.0%) comparisons, artificial intelligence performed better than traditional pharmacoepidemiological techniques. Random forest (seven out of 11 comparisons; 63.6%) and artificial neural network (six out of 10 comparisons; 60.0%) were the techniques that in most of the comparisons outperformed traditional pharmacoepidemiological methods. Conclusion: Only a small fraction of articles compared the performance of artificial intelligence techniques with traditional pharmacoepidemiological methods and not all artificial intelligence techniques have been compared in a Pharmacoepidemiological setting. However, in 50% of comparisons, artificial intelligence performed better than pharmacoepidemiological techniques."

        "Abstract": "Neuromarketing has gained attention to bridge the gap between conventional marketing studies and electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) research. It determines what customers actually want through preference prediction. The performance of EEG-based preference detection systems depends on a suitable selection of feature extraction techniques and machine learning algorithms. In this study, We examined preference detection of neuromarketing dataset using different feature combinations of EEG indices and different algorithms for feature extraction and classification. For EEG feature extraction, we employed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and power spectral density (PSD), which were utilized to measure the EEG-based preference indices that enhance the accuracy of preference detection. Moreover, we compared deep learning with other traditional classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). We also studied the effect of preference indicators on the performance of classification algorithms. Through rigorous offline analysis, we investigated the computational intelligence for preference detection and classification. The performance of the proposed deep neural network (DNN) outperforms KNN and SVM in accuracy, precision, and recall; however, RF achieved results similar to those of the DNN for the same dataset."

        "Abstract": "Background: Emotional intelligence (EI) is potentially associated with higher academic performance. However, no study from the Gulf region has previously assessed if EI affects academic success and academic performance in medical students. Objectives: To examine the relationship between EI and academic success and academic performance in a sample of Saudi Arabian medical students. Methods: This cross-sectional, questionnaire study included all 4th-6th year medical students enrolled at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in the academic year 2017-18. Eligible students were invited to complete the self-administered Schutte Self-Report Emotional Intelligence Test and the Academic Success Inventory for College Students (ASICS) along with a questionnaire eliciting demographic information between January and April 2018. Academic achievement was assessed based on each student's self-reported grade point average in the most recent examination. Results: Of 377 eligible students, 296 (78%) completed the questionnaires. A significant association was identified between overall EI and ASICS scores (r = 0.197; P < 0.001). EI scores were constant in males and females and the year of study. No statistically significant association was observed between EI and academic success across gender and academic years (P > 0.05 for all values). However, in terms of external motivation and career decidedness by level of study, final-year students had higher scores compared with students in the other two study years (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: This study offers primary data on the impact of EI scores on academic success in medical education, and it identified several factors associated with EI and academic success. The findings of this study suggest that EI and academic success are linked, and that both are vital for increasing academic performance."

        "Author": "Talha Burak Alakus",
        "Abstract": "The SARS-CoV2 virus, which causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) has become a pandemic and has expanded all over the world. Because of increasing number of cases day by day, it takes time to interpret the laboratory findings thus the limitations in terms of both treatment and findings are emerged. Due to such limitations, the need for clinical decisions making system with predictive algorithms has arisen. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying the diseases. In this study, we perform clinical predictive models that estimate, using deep learning and laboratory data, which patients are likely to receive a COVID-19 disease. To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, precision, F1-score, recall, AUC, and accuracy scores calculated. Models were tested with 18 laboratory findings from 600 patients and validated with 10 fold cross-validation and train-test split approaches. The experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify patients that have COVID-19 disease at an accuracy of 86.66%, F1-score of 91.89%, precision of 86.75%, recall of 99.42%, and AUC of 62.50%. It is observed that predictive models trained on laboratory findings could be used to predict COVID-19 infection, and can be helpful for medical experts to prioritize the resources correctly. Our models (available at (https://github.com/burakalakuss/COVID-19-Clinical)) can be employed to assists medical experts in validating their initial laboratory findings, and can also be used for clinical prediction studies."

        "Author": "Yue Yuan",
        "Abstract": "As a preventive measure during the COVID-19 epidemic, we have had to stay at home for a long time. The lifestyle of adolescents has undergone severe changes. Almost every school started online education for the first time. Some adolescents have shown low resilience when faced with these changes. Most previous research has focused on mindfulness training and resilience by using cross-sectional or two-point tracking designs. However, little is known about the developmental trajectories of the impact of mindfulness training on resilience, particularly during this epidemic. Therefore, this study aims to explore how the developmental trajectories of resilience are impacted by mindfulness training. After administering the CD-RISC, we recruited 90 students with low levels of resilience in intervention group. Finally, 84 adolescents provided data at each assessment. At the same time, we selected 90 students in the control group. Paired sample t-test was used to compare every factor defined above by time. The result showed that mindfulness training increased students' resilience and emotional intelligence in experiment group. Then in the experiment group, latent growth modeling was used to (1) examine initial levels and changes in resilience over time and (2) predict initial levels and growth in resilience based on emotional intelligence. The findings of this study are as follows: during a mindfulness training intervention, (1) individual resilience tends to increase, and rate of increase grows gradually; there are also significant individual differences in the initial level and development speed; (2) individual emotional intelligence can promote the growth of resilience. With the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, more and more attention is paid to the mental health of students. The research in this article shows that mindfulness training program should be given increasing consideration in the future."

Drawing from a sample of 385 permanent Athenian residents, the study explores the decision-making attributes driving their accommodation purchasing preferences in times of increased uncertainty. The complex dynamics are investigated using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis. A complementary analysis evaluates the size effect of the examined conditions using Necessary Condition Analysis. In total, four solutions are generated concerning: (i) health and safety; (ii) the price-quality nexus; (iii) risk aspects; and (iv) quality related health and safety. The study contributes towards the initiation of the theoretical discourse on the foundations of the exploration of tourists' accommodation choice triggers and dilemmas in times of pandemics. The results inform market intelligence with regard to accommodation-related customer priorities, perceptions and intentions during the pandemic which lay several important managerial implications for the accommodation industry."

        "Abstract": "Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming more prominent in the tourism industry. Nowadays, consumers are faced with multiple options involving both human and robot interactions. A series of experimental studies were implemented. Four experiments demonstrated that consumers had a more positive attitude toward robot-staffed (vs. human-staffed) hotels when COVID-19 was salient. The results were different from previous studies, which were conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the moderating role of perceived threat in consumers' preference for robot-staffed hotels was significant, the respondents' preference was attributed to the global health crisis. This research provides a number of theoretical and managerial implications by improving the understanding of technology acceptance during a health crisis."

        "Author": "Giada Bianchetti",
        "Abstract": "Autofluorescence microscopy is a promising label-free approach to characterize NADH and FAD metabolites in live cells, with potential applications in clinical practice. Although spectrally resolved lifetime imaging techniques can acquire multiparametric information about the biophysical and biochemical state of the metabolites, these data are evaluated at the whole-cell level, thus providing only limited insights in the activation of metabolic networks at the microscale. To overcome this issue, here we introduce an artificial intelligence-based analysis that, leveraging the multiparametric content of spectrally resolved lifetime images, allows to detect and classify, through an unsupervised learning approach, metabolic clusters, which are regions having almost uniform metabolic properties. This method contextually detects the cellular mitochondrial turnover and the metabolic activation state of intracellular compartments at the pixel level, described by two functions: the cytosolic activation state (CAF) and the mitochondrial activation state (MAF). This method was applied to investigate metabolic changes elicited in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 by specific inhibitors of glycolysis and electron transport chain, and by the deregulation of a specific mitochondrial enzyme (ACO2) leading to defective aerobic metabolism associated with tumor growth. In this model, mitochondrial fraction undergoes to a 13% increase upon ACO2 overexpression and the MAF function changes abruptly by altering the metabolic state of about the 25% of the mitochondrial pixels."

        "Abstract": "Due to the unprecedented public health crisis caused by COVID-19, our first contribution to the newly launching journal, Advances in Biomarker Sciences and Technology, has abruptly diverted to focus on the current pandemic. As the number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise steadily around the world, the common goal of healthcare providers, scientists, and government officials worldwide has been to identify the best way to detect the novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, and to treat the viral infection - COVID-19. Accurate detection, timely diagnosis, effective treatment, and future prevention are the vital keys to management of COVID-19, and can help curb the viral spread. Traditionally, biomarkers play a pivotal role in the early detection of disease etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. To assist myriad ongoing investigations and innovations, we developed this current article to overview known and emerging biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 detection, COVID-19 diagnostics, treatment and prognosis, and ongoing work to identify and develop more biomarkers for new drugs and vaccines. Moreover, biomarkers of socio-psychological stress, the high-technology quest for new virtual drug screening, and digital applications are described."

        "Abstract": "Precision medicine informatics is a field of research that incorporates learning systems that generate new knowledge to improve individualized treatments using integrated data sets and models. Given the ever-increasing volumes of data that are relevant to patient care, artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines need to be a central component of such research to speed discovery. Applying AI methodology to complex multidisciplinary information retrieval can support efforts to discover bridging concepts within collaborating communities. This dovetails with precision medicine research, given the information rich multi-omic data that are used in precision medicine analysis pipelines. In this perspective article we define a prototype AI pipeline to facilitate discovering research connections between bioinformatics and clinical researchers. We propose building knowledge representations that are iteratively improved through AI and human-informed learning feedback loops supported through crowdsourcing. To illustrate this, we will explore the specific use case of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a growing health care problem. We will examine AI pipeline construction and utilization in relation to bench-to-bedside bridging concepts with interconnecting knowledge representations applicable to bioinformatics researchers and clinicians."

It is widely touted to become an integral part of routine endoscopies, considering the bulk of data handled by endoscopists and the complex nature of critical analyses performed. However, the application of AI in endoscopy in resource-constrained settings remains fraught with problems. We conducted an extensive literature review using the PubMed database on articles covering the application of AI in endoscopy and the difficulties encountered in resource-constrained settings. We have tried to summarize in the present review the potential problems that may hinder the application of AI in such settings. Hopefully, this review will enable endoscopists and health policymakers to ponder over these issues before trying to extrapolate the advancements of AI in technically advanced settings to those having constraints at multiple levels.

        "Abstract": "Forensic DNA Phenotyping (FDP) is an established but evolving field of DNA testing. It provides intelligence regarding the appearance (externally visible characteristics), biogeographical ancestry and age of an unknown donor and, although not necessarily a requirement for its casework application, has been previously used as a method of last resort in New South Wales (NSW) Police Force investigations. FDP can further assist law enforcement agencies by re-prioritising an existing pool of suspects or generating a new pool of suspects. In recent years, this capability has become ubiquitous with a wide range of service providers offering their expertise to law enforcement and the public. With the increase in the number of providers offering FDP and its potential to direct and target law enforcement resources, a thorough assessment of the applicability of these services was undertaken. Six service providers of FDP were assessed for suitability for NSW Police Force casework based on prediction accuracy, clarity of reporting, limitations of testing, cost and turnaround times. From these assessment criteria, a service provider for the prediction of biogeographical ancestry, hair and eye colour was deemed suitable for use in NSW Police Force casework. Importantly, the study highlighted the need for standardisation of terminology and reporting in this evolving field, and the requirement for interpretation by biologists with specialist expertise to translate the scientific data to intelligence for police investigators."

        "Author": "Mohsen Yoosefzadeh-Najafabadi",
        "Abstract": "Recent substantial advances in high-throughput field phenotyping have provided plant breeders with affordable and efficient tools for evaluating a large number of genotypes for important agronomic traits at early growth stages. Nevertheless, the implementation of large datasets generated by high-throughput phenotyping tools such as hyperspectral reflectance in cultivar development programs is still challenging due to the essential need for intensive knowledge in computational and statistical analyses. In this study, the robustness of three common machine learning (ML) algorithms, multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF), were evaluated for predicting soybean (Glycine max) seed yield using hyperspectral reflectance. For this aim, the hyperspectral reflectance data for the whole spectra ranged from 395 to 1005 nm, which were collected at the R4 and R5 growth stages on 250 soybean genotypes grown in four environments. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) approach was performed to reduce the dimensionality of the hyperspectral reflectance data and select variables with the largest importance values. The results indicated that R5 is more informative stage for measuring hyperspectral reflectance to predict seed yields. The 395 nm reflectance band was also identified as the high ranked band in predicting the soybean seed yield. By considering either full or selected variables as the input variables, the ML algorithms were evaluated individually and combined-version using the ensemble-stacking (E-S) method to predict the soybean yield. The RF algorithm had the highest performance with a value of 84% yield classification accuracy among all the individual tested algorithms. Therefore, by selecting RF as the metaClassifier for E-S method, the prediction accuracy increased to 0.93, using all variables, and 0.87, using selected variables showing the success of using E-S as one of the ensemble techniques. This study demonstrated that soybean breeders could implement E-S algorithm using either the full or selected spectra reflectance to select the high-yielding soybean genotypes, among a large number of genotypes, at early growth stages."

        "Author": "Adrien Laversanne-Finot",
        "Abstract": "Finding algorithms that allow agents to discover a wide variety of skills efficiently and autonomously, remains a challenge of Artificial Intelligence. Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEPs) have been shown to enable real world robots to learn repertoires of policies producing a wide range of diverse effects. They work by enabling agents to autonomously sample goals that they then try to achieve. In practice, this strategy leads to an efficient exploration of complex environments with high-dimensional continuous actions. Until recently, it was necessary to provide the agents with an engineered goal space containing relevant features of the environment. In this article we show that the goal space can be learned using deep representation learning algorithms, effectively reducing the burden of designing goal spaces. Our results pave the way to autonomous learning agents that are able to autonomously build a representation of the world and use this representation to explore the world efficiently. We present experiments in two environments using population-based IMGEPs. The first experiments are performed on a simple, yet challenging, simulated environment. Then, another set of experiments tests the applicability of those principles on a real-world robotic setup, where a 6-joint robotic arm learns to manipulate a ball inside an arena, by choosing goals in a space learned from its past experience."

        "Author": "Andrew A S Soltan",
        "Abstract": "Background: The early clinical course of COVID-19 can be difficult to distinguish from other illnesses driving presentation to hospital. However, viral-specific PCR testing has limited sensitivity and results can take up to 72 h for operational reasons. We aimed to develop and validate two early-detection models for COVID-19, screening for the disease among patients attending the emergency department and the subset being admitted to hospital, using routinely collected health-care data (laboratory tests, blood gas measurements, and vital signs). These data are typically available within the first hour of presentation to hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries, within the existing laboratory infrastructure. Methods: We trained linear and non-linear machine learning classifiers to distinguish patients with COVID-19 from pre-pandemic controls, using electronic health record data for patients presenting to the emergency department and admitted across a group of four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK (Oxford University Hospitals). Data extracted included presentation blood tests, blood gas testing, vital signs, and results of PCR testing for respiratory viruses. Adult patients (>18 years) presenting to hospital before Dec 1, 2019 (before the first COVID-19 outbreak), were included in the COVID-19-negative cohort; those presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2019, and April 19, 2020, with PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were included in the COVID-19-positive cohort. Patients who were subsequently admitted to hospital were included in their respective COVID-19-negative or COVID-19-positive admissions cohorts. Models were calibrated to sensitivities of 70%, 80%, and 90% during training, and performance was initially assessed on a held-out test set generated by an 80:20 split stratified by patients with COVID-19 and balanced equally with pre-pandemic controls. To simulate real-world performance at different stages of an epidemic, we generated test sets with varying prevalences of COVID-19 and assessed predictive values for our models. We prospectively validated our 80% sensitivity models for all patients presenting or admitted to the Oxford University Hospitals between April 20 and May 6, 2020, comparing model predictions with PCR test results. Findings: We assessed 155 689 adult patients presenting to hospital between Dec 1, 2017, and April 19, 2020. 114 957 patients were included in the COVID-negative cohort and 437 in the COVID-positive cohort, for a full study population of 115 394 patients, with 72 310 admitted to hospital. With a sensitive configuration of 80%, our emergency department (ED) model achieved 77·4% sensitivity and 95·7% specificity (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0·939) for COVID-19 among all patients attending hospital, and the admissions model achieved 77·4% sensitivity and 94·8% specificity (AUROC 0·940) for the subset of patients admitted to hospital. Both models achieved high negative predictive values (NPV; >98·5%) across a range of prevalences (≤5%). We prospectively validated our models for all patients presenting and admitted to Oxford University Hospitals in a 2-week test period. The ED model (3326 patients) achieved 92·3% accuracy (NPV 97·6%, AUROC 0·881), and the admissions model (1715 patients) achieved 92·5% accuracy (97·7%, 0·871) in comparison with PCR results. Sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in negative PCR results improved apparent accuracy (ED model 95·1%, admissions model 94·1%) and NPV (ED model 99·0%, admissions model 98·5%). Interpretation: Our models performed effectively as a screening test for COVID-19, excluding the illness with high-confidence by use of clinical data routinely available within 1 h of presentation to hospital. Our approach is rapidly scalable, fitting within the existing laboratory testing infrastructure and standard of care of hospitals in high-income and middle-income countries.

        "Author": "Robert Seifert",
        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence and machine learning based approaches are increasingly finding their way into various areas of nuclear medicine imaging. With the technical development of new methods and the expansion to new fields of application, this trend is likely to become even more pronounced in future. Possible means of application range from automated image reading and classification to correlation with clinical outcomes and to technological applications in image processing and reconstruction. In the context of tumor imaging, that is, predominantly FDG or PSMA PET imaging but also bone scintigraphy, artificial intelligence approaches can be used to quantify the whole-body tumor volume, for the segmentation and classification of pathological foci or to facilitate the diagnosis of micro-metastases. More advanced applications aim at the correlation of image features that are derived by artificial intelligence with clinical endpoints, for example, whole-body tumor volume with overall survival. In nuclear medicine imaging of benign diseases, artificial intelligence methods are predominantly used for automated and/or facilitated image classification and clinical decision making. Automated feature selection, segmentation and classification of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy can help in identifying patients that would benefit from intervention and to forecast clinical prognosis. Automated reporting of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease might be extended to early diagnosis-being of special interest, if targeted treatment options might become available. Technological approaches include artificial intelligence-based attenuation correction of PET images, image reconstruction or anatomical landmarking. Attenuation correction is of special interest for avoiding the need of a coregistered CT scan, in the process of image reconstruction artefacts might be reduced, or ultra low-dose PET images might be denoised. The development of accurate ultra low-dose PET imaging might broaden the method's applicability, for example, toward oncologic PET screening. Most artificial intelligence approaches in nuclear medicine imaging are still in early stages of development, further improvements are necessary for broad clinical applications. In this review, we describe the current trends in the context fields of body oncology, cardiac imaging, and neuroimaging while an additional section puts emphasis on technological trends. Our aim is not only to describe currently available methods, but also to place a special focus on the description of possible future developments."

        "Author": "Lise Wei",
        "Abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) are nuclear diagnostic imaging modalities that are routinely deployed for cancer staging and monitoring. They hold the advantage of detecting disease related biochemical and physiologic abnormalities in advance of anatomical changes, thus widely used for staging of disease progression, identification of the treatment gross tumor volume, monitoring of disease, as well as prediction of outcomes and personalization of treatment regimens. Among the arsenal of different functional imaging modalities, nuclear imaging has benefited from early adoption of quantitative image analysis starting from simple standard uptake value normalization to more advanced extraction of complex imaging uptake patterns; thanks to application of sophisticated image processing and machine learning algorithms. In this review, we discuss the application of image processing and machine/deep learning techniques to PET/CT imaging with special focus on the oncological radiotherapy domain as a case study and draw examples from our work and others to highlight current status and future potentials."

        "Author": "Marie Manon Krebs Krarup",
        "Abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death around the world although early diagnosis remains vital to enabling access to curative treatment options. This article briefly describes the current role of imaging, in particular 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) PET/CT, in lung cancer and specifically the role of artificial intelligence with CT followed by a detailed review of the published studies applying artificial intelligence (ie, machine learning and deep learning), on FDG PET or combined PET/CT images with the purpose of early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules, and characterization of lung tumors and mediastinal lymph nodes. A comprehensive search was performed on Pubmed, Embase, and clinical trial databases. The studies were analyzed with a modified version of the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) and Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) statement. The search resulted in 361 studies; of these 29 were included; all retrospective; none were clinical trials. Twenty-two records evaluated standard machine learning (ML) methods on imaging features (ie, support vector machine), and 7 studies evaluated new ML methods (ie, deep learning) applied directly on PET or PET/CT images. The studies mainly reported positive results regarding the use of ML methods for diagnosing pulmonary nodules, characterizing lung tumors and mediastinal lymph nodes. However, 22 of the 29 studies were lacking a relevant comparator and/or lacking independent testing of the model. Application of ML methods with feature and image input from PET/CT for diagnosing and characterizing lung cancer is a relatively young area of research with great promise. Nevertheless, current published studies are often under-powered and lacking a clinically relevant comparator and/or independent testing."

        "Title": "Artificial Intelligence for Optimization and Interpretation of PET/CT and PET/MR Images",
        "Author": "Greg Zaharchuk",
        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently attracted much attention for its potential use in healthcare applications. The use of AI to improve and extract more information out of medical images, given their parallels with natural images and the immense progress in the area of computer vision, has been at the forefront of these advances. This is due to a convergence of factors, including the increasing numbers of scans performed, the availability of open source AI tools, and decreases in the costs of hardware required to implement these technologies. In this article, we review the progress in the use of AI toward optimizing PET/CT and PET/MRI studies. These two methods, which combine molecular information with structural and (in the case of MRI) functional imaging, are extremely valuable for a wide range of clinical indications. They are also tremendously data-rich modalities and as such are highly amenable to data-driven technologies such as AI. The first half of the article will focus on methods to improve PET reconstruction and image quality, which has multiple benefits including faster image acquisition, image reconstruction, and lower or even \"zero\" radiation dose imaging. It will also address the value of AI-driven methods to perform MR-based attenuation correction. The second half will address how some of these advances can be used to perform to optimize diagnosis from the acquired images, with examples given for whole-body oncology, cardiology, and neurology indications. Overall, it is likely that the use of AI will markedly improve both the quality and safety of PET/CT and PET/MRI as well as enhance our ability to interpret the scans and follow lesions over time. This will hopefully lead to expanded clinical use cases for these valuable technologies leading to better patient care."

        "Abstract": "This short review aims at providing the readers with an update on the current status, as well as future perspectives in the quickly evolving field of radiomics applied to the field of PET/CT imaging. Numerous pitfalls have been identified in study design, data acquisition, segmentation, features calculation and modeling by the radiomics community, and these are often the same issues across all image modalities and clinical applications, however some of these are specific to PET/CT (and SPECT/CT) imaging and therefore the present paper focuses on those. In most cases, recommendations and potential methodological solutions do exist and should therefore be followed to improve the overall quality and reproducibility of published studies. In terms of future evolutions, the techniques from the larger field of artificial intelligence (AI), including those relying on deep neural networks (also known as deep learning) have already shown impressive potential to provide solutions, especially in terms of automation, but also to maybe fully replace the tools the radiomics community has been using until now in order to build the usual radiomics workflow. Some important challenges remain to be addressed before the full impact of AI may be realized but overall the field has made striking advances over the last few years and it is expected advances will continue at a rapid pace."

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) in nuclear medicine has gained significant traction and promises to be a disruptive, but innovative, technology. Recent developments in artificial neural networks, machine learning, and deep learning have ignited debate with respect to ethical and legal challenges associated with the use of AI in healthcare and medicine. While AI in nuclear medicine has the potential to improve workflow and productivity, and enhance clinical and research capabilities, there remains a professional responsibility to the profession and to patients: ethical, social, and legal. Enthusiasm to embrace new technology should not displace responsibilities for the ethical, social, and legal application of technology. This is especially true in relation to data usage, the algorithms applied, and how algorithms are used in practice. Governance of software and algorithms used for detection (segmentation) and/or diagnosis (classification) of disease using medical images requires rigorous evidence-based regulation. A number of frameworks have been developed for ethical application of AI generally in society and in radiology. For nuclear medicine, consideration needs to be given to beneficence, nonmaleficence, fairness and justice, safety, reliability, data security, privacy and confidentiality, mitigation of bias, transparency, explainability, and autonomy. AI is merely a tool, how it is utilised is a human choice. There is potential for AI applications to enhance clinical and research practice in nuclear medicine and concurrently produce deeper, more meaningful interactions between the physicians and the patient. Nonetheless ethical, legal, and social challenges demand careful attention and formulation of standards/guidelines for nuclear medicine."

        "Author": "Geoffrey Currie",
        "Abstract": "The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in nuclear medicine has occurred over the last 50 years but more recent developments in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have driven new capabilities of AI in nuclear medicine. In nuclear medicine, the artificial neural network (ANN) is the backbone of ML and DL. The inputs may be radiomic features that have been extracted from the image files or, if using a convolutional neural network (CNN), may be the images themselves. AI in nuclear medicine re-engineers and re-imagines clinical and research capabilities. An understanding of the principles of AI, ML and DL contextualised to nuclear medicine allows richer engagement in clinical and research applications, and capacity for problem solving where required. Simple applications of ML include quality assurance, risk assessment, business analytics and rudimentary classifications. More complex applications of DL for detection, localisation, classification, segmentation, quantitation and radiomic feature extraction using CNNs can be applied to general nuclear medicine, SPECT, PET, CT and MRI. There are also applications of ANNs and ML that allow small datasets (and larger ones) to be analysed in parallel to conventional statistical analysis. AI has assimilated into the clinical and research practice of nuclear medicine with little disruption. The emergence of ML and DL applications, however, has produced a seismic significant shift in the clinical and research landscape that demands at least rudimentary understanding of the principles of AI, ANNs and CNNs among nuclear medicine professionals."

        "Title": "Predicting thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 ICU patients using machine learning",
        "Author": "Davy van de Sande",
        "Abstract": "Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge for intensive care units (ICU) in part due to the failure to identify risks for patients early and the inability to render an accurate prognosis. Previous reports suggest a strong association between hypercoagulability and poor outcome. Factors related to hemostasis may, therefore, serve as tools to improve the management of COVID-19 patients. Aim: The purpose of this report is to develop a model to determine whether it is possible to early identify COVID-19 patients at risk for thromboembolic complications (TCs). Methods: We analyzed electronic health record data of 108 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the adult ICU of the Erasmus University Medical Center between February 27 and May 20, 2020. By training a decision tree classifier on 66% of the available data, a model for the prediction of TCs was developed. Results: The median (interquartile range) age was 62 (53-70) years and 73% were male. Forty-three patients (40%) developed a TC during their ICU stay. Mortality was higher for patients in the TCs group compared to the control group (26% vs. 8%, P=0.03). Lactate dehydrogenase, standardized bicarbonate, albumin, and leukocytes were identified by the Decision Tree classifier as the most powerful predictors for TCs 2 days before the onset of the TC, with a sensitivity of 73% and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.7 on the test dataset. Conclusions: Clinically relevant TCs frequently occur in critically ill COVID-19 patients. These can successfully be predicted using a decision tree model. Although this model could be of special importance to aid clinical decision making, its generalizability and clinical impact should be determined in a larger population. Relevance for patients: Recently, severe TCs were observed in COVID-19 patients with progressive respiratory failure warranting ICU treatment. Timely identification of patients at risk of developing TCs is critical inasmuch as it would enable clinicians to initiate potentially salvaging therapeutic anticoagulation."

        "Title": "Machine Gaze: Self-Identification Through Play With a computer Vision-Based Projection and Robotics System",
        "Author": "Ray Lc",
        "Abstract": "Children begin to develop self-awareness when they associate images and abilities with themselves. Such \"construction of self\" continues throughout adult life as we constantly cycle through different forms of self-awareness, seeking, to redefine ourselves. Modern technologies like screens and artificial intelligence threaten to alter our development of self-awareness, because children and adults are exposed to machines, tele-presences, and displays that increasingly become part of human identity. We use avatars, invent digital lives, and augment ourselves with digital imprints that depart from reality, making the development of self-identification adjust to digital technologies that blur the boundary between us and our devices. To empower children and adults to see themselves and artificially intelligent machines as separately aware entities, we created the persona of a salvaged supermarket security camera refurbished and enhanced with the power of computer vision to detect human faces, and project them on a large-scale 3D face sculpture. The surveillance camera system moves its head to point to human faces at times, but at other times, humans have to get its attention by moving to its vicinity, creating a dynamic where audiences attempt to see their own faces on the sculpture by gazing into the machine's eye. We found that audiences began attaining an understanding of machines that interpret our faces as separate from our identities, with their own agendas and agencies that show by the way they serendipitously interact with us. The machine-projected images of us are their own interpretation rather than our own, distancing us from our digital analogs. In the accompanying workshop, participants learn about how computer vision works by putting on disguises in order to escape from an algorithm detecting them as the same person by analyzing their faces. Participants learn that their own agency affects how machines interpret them, gaining an appreciation for the way their own identities and machines' awareness of them can be separate entities that can be manipulated for play. Together the installation and workshop empower children and adults to think beyond identification with digital technology to recognize the machine's own interpretive abilities that lie separate from human being's own self-awareness."

        "Author": "Iman Sharifi",
        "Abstract": "In this paper, a new scheme for multi-lateral remote rehabilitation is proposed. There exist one therapist, one patient, and several trainees, who are participating in the process of telerehabilitation (TR) in this scheme. This kind of strategy helps the therapist to facilitate the neurorehabilitation remotely. Thus, the patients can stay in their homes, resulting in safer and less expensive costs. Meanwhile, several trainees in medical education centers can be trained by participating partially in the rehabilitation process. The trainees participate in a \"hands-on\" manner; so, they feel like they are rehabilitating the patient directly. For implementing such a scheme, a novel theoretical method is proposed using the power of multi-agent systems (MAS) theory into the multi-lateral teleoperation, based on the self-intelligence in the MAS. In the previous related works, changing the number of participants in the multi-lateral teleoperation tasks required redesigning the controllers; while, in this paper using both of the decentralized control and the self-intelligence of the MAS, avoids the need for redesigning the controller in the proposed structure. Moreover, in this research, uncertainties in the operators' dynamics, as well as time-varying delays in the communication channels, are taken into account. It is shown that the proposed structure has two tuning matrices (L and D) that can be used for different scenarios of multi-lateral teleoperation. By choosing proper tuning matrices, many related works about the multi-lateral teleoperation/telerehabilitation process can be implemented. In the final section of the paper, several scenarios were introduced to achieve \"Simultaneous Training and Therapy\" in TR and are implemented with the proposed structure. The results confirmed the stability and performance of the proposed framework."

        "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) have developed rapidly in the past few years, as both the Internet and \"things\" have evolved significantly. \"Things\" now range from simple Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices to smart wireless sensors, intelligent wireless sensors and actuators, robotic things, and autonomous vehicles operating in consumer, business, and industrial environments. The emergence of \"intelligent things\" (static or mobile) in collaborative autonomous fleets requires new architectures, connectivity paradigms, trustworthiness frameworks, and platforms for the integration of applications across different business and industrial domains. These new applications accelerate the development of autonomous system design paradigms and the proliferation of the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT). In IoRT, collaborative robotic things can communicate with other things, learn autonomously, interact safely with the environment, humans and other things, and gain qualities like self-maintenance, self-awareness, self-healing, and fail-operational behavior. IoRT applications can make use of the individual, collaborative, and collective intelligence of robotic things, as well as information from the infrastructure and operating context to plan, implement and accomplish tasks under different environmental conditions and uncertainties. The continuous, real-time interaction with the environment makes perception, location, communication, cognition, computation, connectivity, propulsion, and integration of federated IoRT and digital platforms important components of new-generation IoRT applications. This paper reviews the taxonomy of the IoRT, emphasizing the IoRT intelligent connectivity, architectures, interoperability, and trustworthiness framework, and surveys the technologies that enable the application of the IoRT across different domains to perform missions more efficiently, productively, and completely. The aim is to provide a novel perspective on the IoRT that involves communication among robotic things and humans and highlights the convergence of several technologies and interactions between different taxonomies used in the literature."

        "Author": "Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires",
        "Abstract": "Robotic agents should be able to learn from sub-symbolic sensor data and, at the same time, be able to reason about objects and communicate with humans on a symbolic level. This raises the question of how to overcome the gap between symbolic and sub-symbolic artificial intelligence. We propose a semantic world modeling approach based on bottom-up object anchoring using an object-centered representation of the world. Perceptual anchoring processes continuous perceptual sensor data and maintains a correspondence to a symbolic representation. We extend the definitions of anchoring to handle multi-modal probability distributions and we couple the resulting symbol anchoring system to a probabilistic logic reasoner for performing inference. Furthermore, we use statistical relational learning to enable the anchoring framework to learn symbolic knowledge in the form of a set of probabilistic logic rules of the world from noisy and sub-symbolic sensor input. The resulting framework, which combines perceptual anchoring and statistical relational learning, is able to maintain a semantic world model of all the objects that have been perceived over time, while still exploiting the expressiveness of logical rules to reason about the state of objects which are not directly observed through sensory input data. To validate our approach we demonstrate, on the one hand, the ability of our system to perform probabilistic reasoning over multi-modal probability distributions, and on the other hand, the learning of probabilistic logical rules from anchored objects produced by perceptual observations. The learned logical rules are, subsequently, used to assess our proposed probabilistic anchoring procedure. We demonstrate our system in a setting involving object interactions where object occlusions arise and where probabilistic inference is needed to correctly anchor objects."

        "Author": "Gabriel Ramos-Fernandez",
        "Abstract": "Recent work suggests that collective computation of social structure can minimize uncertainty about the social and physical environment, facilitating adaptation. We explore these ideas by studying how fission-fusion social structure arises in spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) groups, exploring whether monkeys use social knowledge to collectively compute subgroup size distributions adaptive for foraging in variable environments. We assess whether individual decisions to stay in or leave subgroups are conditioned on strategies based on the presence or absence of others. We search for this evidence in a time series of subgroup membership. We find that individuals have multiple strategies, suggesting that the social knowledge of different individuals is important. These stay-leave strategies provide microscopic inputs to a stochastic model of collective computation encoded in a family of circuits. Each circuit represents an hypothesis for how collectives combine strategies to make decisions, and how these produce various subgroup size distributions. By running these circuits forward in simulation we generate new subgroup size distributions and measure how well they match food abundance in the environment using transfer entropies. We find that spider monkeys decide to stay or go using information from multiple individuals and that they can collectively compute a distribution of subgroup size that makes efficient use of ephemeral sources of nutrition. We are able to artificially tune circuits with subgroup size distributions that are a better fit to the environment than the observed. This suggests that a combination of measurement error, constraint, and adaptive lag are diminishing the power of collective computation in this system. These results are relevant for a more general understanding of the emergence of ordered states in multi-scale social systems with adaptive properties-both natural and engineered."

        "Title": "Human Movement Representation on Multivariate Time Series for Recognition of Professional Gestures and Forecasting Their Trajectories",
        "Author": "Sotiris Manitsaris",
        "Abstract": "Human-centered artificial intelligence is increasingly deployed in professional workplaces in Industry 4.0 to address various challenges related to the collaboration between the operators and the machines, the augmentation of their capabilities, or the improvement of the quality of their work and life in general. Intelligent systems and autonomous machines need to continuously recognize and follow the professional actions and gestures of the operators in order to collaborate with them and anticipate their trajectories for avoiding potential collisions and accidents. Nevertheless, the recognition of patterns of professional gestures is a very challenging task for both research and the industry. There are various types of human movements that the intelligent systems need to perceive, for example, gestural commands to machines and professional actions with or without the use of tools. Moreover, the interclass and intraclass spatiotemporal variances together with the very limited access to annotated human motion data constitute a major research challenge. In this paper, we introduce the Gesture Operational Model, which describes how gestures are performed based on assumptions that focus on the dynamic association of body entities, their synergies, and their serial and non-serial mediations, as well as their transitioning over time from one state to another. Then, the assumptions of the Gesture Operational Model are translated into a simultaneous equation system for each body entity through State-Space modeling. The coefficients of the equation are computed using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation method. The simulation of the model generates a confidence-bounding box for every entity that describes the tolerance of its spatial variance over time. The contribution of our approach is demonstrated for both recognizing gestures and forecasting human motion trajectories. In recognition, it is combined with continuous Hidden Markov Models to boost the recognition accuracy when the likelihoods are not confident. In forecasting, a motion trajectory can be estimated by taking as minimum input two observations only. The performance of the algorithm has been evaluated using four industrial datasets that contain gestures and actions from a TV assembly line, the glassblowing industry, the gestural commands to Automated Guided Vehicles as well as the Human-Robot Collaboration in the automotive assembly lines. The hybrid approach State-Space and HMMs outperforms standard continuous HMMs and a 3DCNN-based end-to-end deep architecture."

One of the reasons appears to be the unmatched performance achieved by such systems. This has resulted in an enormous hope on such techniques and often these are viewed as all-cure solutions. But most of these systems cannot explain why a particular decision is made (black box) and sometimes miserably fail in cases where other systems would not. Consequently, in critical applications such as healthcare and defense practitioners do not like to trust such systems. Although an AI system is often designed taking inspiration from the brain, there is not much attempt to exploit cues from the brain in true sense. In our opinion, to realize intelligent systems with human like reasoning ability, we need to exploit knowledge from the brain science. Here we discuss a few findings in brain science that may help designing intelligent systems. We explain the relevance of transparency, explainability, learning from a few examples, and the trustworthiness of an AI system. We also discuss a few ways that may help to achieve these attributes in a learning system."

        "Abstract": "Bioinspired and biomimetic soft machines rely on functions and working principles that have been abstracted from biology but that have evolved over 3.5 billion years. So far, few examples from the huge pool of natural models have been examined and transferred to technical applications. Like living organisms, subsequent generations of soft machines will autonomously respond, sense, and adapt to the environment. Plants as concept generators remain relatively unexplored in biomimetic approaches to robotics and related technologies, despite being able to grow, and continuously adapt in response to environmental stimuli. In this research review, we highlight recent developments in plant-inspired soft machine systems based on movement principles. We focus on inspirations taken from fast active movements in the carnivorous Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) and compare current developments in artificial Venus flytraps with their biological role model. The advantages and disadvantages of current systems are also analyzed and discussed, and a new state-of-the-art autonomous system is derived. Incorporation of the basic structural and functional principles of the Venus flytrap into novel autonomous applications in the field of robotics not only will inspire further plant-inspired biomimetic developments but might also advance contemporary plant-inspired robots, leading to fully autonomous systems utilizing bioinspired working concepts."

We built DE NIRO to perform a wide variety of manipulation behaviors, with a focus on pick-and-place tasks. DE NIRO is designed to be used in a domestic environment, especially in support of caregivers working with the elderly. Given this design focus, DE NIRO can interact naturally, reliably, and safely with humans, autonomously navigate through environments on command, intelligently retrieve or move target objects, and avoid collisions efficiently. We describe DE NIRO's hardware and software, including an extensive vision sensor suite of 2D and 3D LIDARs, a depth camera, and a 360-degree camera rig; two types of custom grippers; and a custom-built exoskeleton called DE VITO. We demonstrate DE NIRO's manipulation capabilities in three illustrative challenges: First, we have DE NIRO perform a fetch-an-object challenge. Next, we add more cognition to DE NIRO's object recognition and grasping abilities, confronting it with small objects of unknown shape. Finally, we extend DE NIRO's capabilities into dual-arm manipulation of larger objects. We put particular emphasis on the features that enable DE NIRO to interact safely and naturally with humans. Our contribution is in sharing how a humanoid robot with complex capabilities can be designed and built quickly with off-the-shelf hardware and open-source software.

        "Author": "David St-Onge",
        "Abstract": "Many applications benefit from the use of multiple robots, but their scalability and applicability are fundamentally limited when relying on a central control station. Getting beyond the centralized approach can increase the complexity of the embedded software, the sensitivity to the network topology, and render the deployment on physical devices tedious and error-prone. This work introduces a software-based solution to cope with these challenges on commercial hardware. We bring together our previous work on Buzz, the swarm-oriented programming language, and the many contributions of the Robotic Operating System (ROS) community into a reliable workflow, from rapid prototyping of decentralized behaviors up to robust field deployment. The Buzz programming language is a hardware independent, domain-specific (swarm-oriented), and composable language. From simulation to the field, a Buzz script can stay unmodified and almost seamlessly applicable to all units of a heterogeneous robotic team. We present the software structure of our solution, and the swarm-oriented paradigms it encompasses. While the design of a new behavior can be achieved on a lightweight simulator, we show how our security mechanisms enhance field deployment robustness. In addition, developers can update their scripts in the field using a safe software release mechanism. Integrating Buzz in ROS, adding safety mechanisms and granting field updates are core contributions essential to swarm robotics deployment: from simulation to the field. We show the applicability of our work with the implementation of two practical decentralized scenarios: a robust generic task allocation strategy and an optimized area coverage algorithm. Both behaviors are explained and tested with simulations, then experimented with heterogeneous ground-and-air robotic teams."

        "Abstract": "In swarm robotics multiple robots collectively solve problems by forming advantageous structures and behaviors similar to the ones observed in natural systems, such as swarms of bees, birds, or fish. However, the step to industrial applications has not yet been made successfully. Literature is light on real-world swarm applications that apply actual swarm algorithms. Typically, only parts of swarm algorithms are used which we refer to as basic swarm behaviors. In this paper we collect and categorize these behaviors into spatial organization, navigation, decision making, and miscellaneous. This taxonomy is then applied to categorize a number of existing swarm robotic applications from research and industrial domains. Along with the classification, we give a comprehensive overview of research platforms that can be used for testing and evaluating swarm behavior, systems that are already on the market, and projects that target a specific market. Results from this survey show that swarm robotic applications are still rare today. Many industrial projects still rely on centralized control, and even though a solution with multiple robots is employed, the principal idea of swarm robotics of distributed decision making is neglected. We identified mainly following reasons: First of all, swarm behavior emerging from local interactions is hard to predict and a proof of its eligibility for applications in an industrial context is difficult to provide. Second, current communication architectures often do not match requirements for swarm communication, which often leads to a system with a centralized communication infrastructure. Finally, testing swarms for real industrial applications is an issue, since deployment in a productive environment is typically too risky and simulations of a target system may not be sufficiently accurate. In contrast, the research platforms present a means for transforming swarm robotics solutions from theory to prototype industrial systems."

        "Author": "Zhichao Yang",
        "Abstract": "One of the fundamental goals of artificial intelligence is to build computer-based expert systems. Inferring clinical diagnoses to generate a clinical assessment during a patient encounter is a crucial step towards building a medical diagnostic system. Previous works were mainly based on either medical domain-specific knowledge, or patients' prior diagnoses and clinical encounters. In this paper, we propose a novel model for automated clinical assessment generation (MCAG). MCAG is built on an innovative graph neural network, where rich clinical knowledge is incorporated into an end-to-end corpus-learning system. Our evaluation results against physician generated gold standard show that MCAG significantly improves the BLEU and rouge score compared with competitive baseline models. Further, physicians' evaluation showed that MCAG could generate high-quality assessments."

        "Abstract": "Classical conditioning plays a critical role in the learning process of biological brains, and many computational models have been built to reproduce the related classical experiments. However, these models can reproduce and explain only a limited range of typical phenomena in classical conditioning. Based on existing biological findings concerning classical conditioning, we build a brain-inspired classical conditioning (BICC) model. Compared with other computational models, our BICC model can reproduce as many as 15 classical experiments, explaining a broader set of findings than other models have, and offers better computational explainability for both the experimental phenomena and the biological mechanisms of classical conditioning. Finally, we validate our theoretical model on a humanoid robot in three classical conditioning experiments (acquisition, extinction, and reacquisition) and a speed generalization experiment, and the results show that our model is computationally feasible as a foundation for brain-inspired robot classical conditioning."

However, this is not to discredit CAD's ability but to further encourage the adoption of artificial intelligence-based algorithms into the toolset of radiologists. Methods: This study will use Hologic (Marlborough, MA, USA) and General Electric (Boston, MA, USA) CAD read images provided by patients found to be Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 6 from 2019 to 2020. In addition, patient information will be pulled from our institution's emergency medical record to confirm the findings seen in the pathologist report and the radiology read. Results: Data from a total of 24 female breast cancer patients from January 31st 2019 to April 31st 2020, was gathered from our institution's emergency medical record with restrictions in patient numbers due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Within our patient population, CAD imaging was shown to be statistically significant in misidentifying breast cancer, while radiologist interpretation still proves to be the most effective tool. Conclusion: Despite a low sample size due to COVID-19, this study found that CAD did have significant difficulty in differentiating benign vs. malignant lesions. CAD should not be ignored, but it is not specific enough. Although CAD often marks cancer, it also marks several areas that are not cancer. CAD is currently best used as an additional tool for the radiologist."

        "Abstract": "Healthcare information systems can reduce the expenses of treatment, foresee episodes of pestilences, help stay away from preventable illnesses, and improve personal life satisfaction. As of late, considerable volumes of heterogeneous and differing medicinal services data are being produced from different sources covering clinic records of patients, lab results, and wearable devices, making it hard for conventional data processing to handle and manage this amount of data. Confronted with the difficulties and challenges facing the process of managing healthcare big data such as volume, velocity, and variety, healthcare information systems need to use new methods and techniques for managing and processing such data to extract useful information and knowledge. In the recent few years, a large number of organizations and companies have shown enthusiasm for using semantic web technologies with healthcare big data to convert data into knowledge and intelligence. In this paper, we review the state of the art on the semantic web for the healthcare industry. Based on our literature review, we will discuss how different techniques, standards, and points of view created by the semantic web community can participate in addressing the challenges related to healthcare big data."

        "Author": "Nasrin Ostvar",
        "Abstract": "In recent years, ensemble classification methods have been widely investigated in both industry and literature in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The main advantage of this approach is to benefit from a set of classifiers instead of using a single classifier with the aim of improving the prediction performance, such as accuracy. Selecting the base classifiers and the method for combining them are the most challenging issues in the ensemble classifiers. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous dynamic ensemble classifier (HDEC) which uses multiple classification algorithms. The main advantage of using heterogeneous algorithms is increasing the diversity among the base classifiers as it is a key point for an ensemble system to be successful. In this method, we first train many classifiers with the original data. Then, they are separated based on their strength in recognizing either positive or negative instances. For doing this, we consider the true positive rate and true negative rate, respectively. In the next step, the classifiers are categorized into two groups according to their efficiency in the mentioned measures. Finally, the outputs of the two groups are compared with each other to generate the final prediction. For evaluating the proposed approach, it has been applied to 12 datasets from the UCI and LIBSVM repositories and calculated two popular prediction performance metrics, including accuracy and geometric mean. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed approach in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods."

        "Author": "John H H Song",
        "Abstract": "Metacognition, the cognition about cognition, is closely linked to intelligence and therefore understanding the metacognitive processes underlying intelligence test performance, specifically on Raven's Progressive Matrices, could help advance the knowledge about intelligence. The measurement of metacognition, is often done using domain-general offline questionnaires or domain-specific online think-aloud protocols. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between metacognitive awareness and intelligence via the design and use of a novel Meta-Cognitive Awareness Scale - Domain Specific (MCAS-DS) that encourages reflection of task strategy processes. This domain-specific scale was first constructed to measure participants' awareness of their own metacognition linked to Raven's Progressive Matrices (SPM). Following discriminatory index and Exploratory Factor Analysis, a 15-item scale was derived. Exploratory Factor Analysis showed five factors: Awareness of Engagement in Self-Monitoring, Awareness of Own Ability, Awareness of Responding Speed/Time, Awareness of Alternative Solutions and Awareness of Requisite Problem-Solving Resources. The intelligence level of ninety-eight adults was then estimated using Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices. Participants also completed the MCAS-DS, and further items that examined their test-taking behavior and Confidence level. Metacognitive awareness was positively correlated to standardized IQ scores derived from the SPM whilst Over-Confidence derived using the Confidence level measure was negatively correlated to SPM. Despite some limitations, this study shows promise for elucidating the relationship between metacognitive awareness and intelligence using the task-specific scale."

        "Author": "Joanna Halicka-Masłowska",
        "Abstract": "Objective: Self-harm acts are highly prevalent among adolescents with conduct disorder. It has been shown that low level of emotional intelligence (EI) might be related to a higher risk of self-injuries. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this association are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore whether psychopathological symptoms and selected psychological processes mediate the association between EI and self-harm risk in adolescents with conduct disorders. Method: Out of 162 adolescents with conduct disorder approached for participation, 136 individuals (aged 14.8 ± 1.2 years, 56.6% females) were enrolled and completed the questionnaires evaluating the level of EI, depression, anxiety, impulsiveness, empathy, venturesomeness, self-esteem, and disgust. Results: Individuals with a lifetime history of self-injuries had significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety and impulsivity as well as significantly lower levels of EI and self-esteem. Higher levels of EI were associated with significantly higher levels of self-esteem, venturesomeness and empathy as well as significantly lower levels of depression, anxiety and impulsivity. Further analysis revealed that trait and state anxiety as well as self-esteem were complete mediators of the association between EI and self-harm risk. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that anxiety and self-esteem might mediate the association between EI and a risk of self-injuries in adolescents with conduct disorder. However, a cross-sectional design of this study limits conclusions on the direction of causality. Longitudinal studies are needed to test validity of our model."

        "Author": "Liangxu Xie",
        "Abstract": "The accurate predicting of physical properties and bioactivity of drug molecules in deep learning depends on how molecules are represented. Many types of molecular descriptors have been developed for quantitative structure-activity/property relationships quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSPR). However, each molecular descriptor is optimized for a specific application with encoding preference. Considering that standalone featurization methods may only cover parts of information of the chemical molecules, we proposed to build the conjoint fingerprint by combining two supplementary fingerprints. The impact of conjoint fingerprint and each standalone fingerprint on predicting performance was systematically evaluated in predicting the logarithm of the partition coefficient (logP) and binding affinity of protein-ligand by using machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) methods, including random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), long short-term memory network (LSTM), and deep neural network (DNN). The results demonstrated that the conjoint fingerprint yielded improved predictive performance, even outperforming the consensus model using two standalone fingerprints among four out of five examined methods. Given that the conjoint fingerprint scheme shows easy extensibility and high applicability, we expect that the proposed conjoint scheme would create new opportunities for continuously improving predictive performance of deep learning by harnessing the complementarity of various types of fingerprints."

        "Author": "Abdullahi Garba Usman",
        "Abstract": "Isoquercitrin is a flavonoid chemical compound that can be extracted from different plant species such as Mangifera indica (mango), Rheum nobile , Annona squamosal , Camellia sinensis (tea), and coriander ( Coriandrum sativum L.). It possesses various biological activities such as the prevention of thromboembolism and has anticancer, antiinflammatory, and antifatigue activities. Therefore, there is a critical need to elucidate and predict the qualitative and quantitative properties of this phytochemical compound using the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. In this paper, three different nonlinear models including artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector machine (SVM),in addition to a classical linear model [multilinear regression analysis (MLR)], were used for the prediction of the retention time (tR) and peak area (PA) for isoquercitrin using HPLC. The simulation uses concentration of the standard, composition of the mobile phases (MP-A and MP-B), and pH as the corresponding input variables. The performance efficiency of the models was evaluated using relative mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), determination coefficient (DC), and correlation coefficient (CC). The obtained results demonstrated that all four models are capable of predicting the qualitative and quantitative properties of the bioactive compound. A predictive comparison of the models showed that M3 had the highest prediction accuracy among the three models. Further evaluation of the results showed that ANFIS-M3 outperformed the other models and serves as the best model for the prediction of PA. On the other hand, ANN-M3proved its merit and emerged as the best model for tR simulation. The overall predictive accuracy of the best models showed them to be reliable tools for both qualitative and quantitative determination."

        "Abstract": "Retention index in gas chromatographic analyses is an essential tool for appropriate analyte identification. Currently, many libraries providing retention indices for a huge number of compounds on distinct stationary phase chemistries are available. However, situation could be complicated in the case of unknown unknowns not present in such libraries. The importance of identification of these compounds have risen together with a rapidly expanding interest in non-targeted analyses in the last decade. Therefore, precise in silico computation/prediction of retention indices based on a suggested molecular structure will be highly appreciated in such situations. On this basis, a predictive model based on deep learning was developed and presented in this paper. It is designed for user-friendly and accurate prediction of retention indices of compounds in gas chromatography with the semi-standard non-polar stationary phase. Simplified Molecular Input Entry System (SMILES) is used as the model's input. Architecture of the model consists of 2D-convolutional layers, together with batch normalization, max pooling, dropout, and three residual connections. The model reaches median absolute error of prediction of the retention index for validation and test set at 16.4 and 16.0 units, respectively. Median percentage error is lower than or equal to 0.81% in the case of all mentioned data sets. Finally, the DeepReI model is presented in R package, and is available on https://github.com/TomasVrzal/DeepReI together with a user-friendly graphical user interface."

        "Abstract": "Although patient intelligence may be an important determinant of the degree to which individuals may comprehend, comply with, and ultimately benefit from trauma-focused treatment, no prior studies have examined the impact of patient intelligence on benefit from psychotherapies for PTSD. We investigated the degree to which educational achievement, often used as a proxy for intelligence, and estimated full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) scores themselves moderated treatment outcomes for two effective psychotherapies for PTSD: Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Written Exposure Therapy (WET). Participants, 126 treatment-seeking adults with PTSD (52% male; mean age = 43.9, SD = 14.6), were equally randomized to CPT and WET; PTSD symptom severity was measured at baseline and 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, and 60-weeks following the first treatment session. Multilevel models revealed that participants with higher FSIQ scores experienced significantly greater PTSD symptom reduction through the 24-week assessment in CPT but not WET; this effect did not persist through the 60-week assessment. Educational achievement did not moderate symptom change through either 24- or 60-weeks. Individuals with higher FSIQ who are treated with CPT may experience greater symptom improvement in the early stages of recovery."

        "Abstract": "Background: As the prevalence of hip osteoarthritis increases, the number of total hip arthroplasty (THA) procedures performed is also projected to increase. Accurately risk-stratifying patients who undergo THA would be of great utility, given the significant cost and morbidity associated with developing perioperative complications. We aim to develop a novel machine learning (ML)-based ensemble algorithm for the prediction of major complications after THA, as well as compare its performance against standard benchmark ML methods. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of 89,986 adults who underwent primary THA at any California-licensed hospital between 2015 and 2017. The primary outcome was major complications (eg infection, venous thromboembolism, cardiac complication, pulmonary complication). We developed a model predicting complication risk using AutoPrognosis, an automated ML framework that configures the optimally performing ensemble of ML-based prognostic models. We compared our model with logistic regression and standard benchmark ML models, assessing discrimination and calibration. Results: There were 545 patients who had major complications (0.61%). Our novel algorithm was well-calibrated and improved risk prediction compared to logistic regression, as well as outperformed the other four standard benchmark ML algorithms. The variables most important for AutoPrognosis (eg malnutrition, dementia, cancer) differ from those that are most important for logistic regression (eg chronic atherosclerosis, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Conclusion: We report a novel ensemble ML algorithm for the prediction of major complications after THA. It demonstrates superior risk prediction compared to logistic regression and other standard ML benchmark algorithms. By providing accurate prognostic information, this algorithm may facilitate more informed preoperative shared decision-making."

Traditional epidemiological tools are being significantly complemented by recent innovations especially using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. AI-based model systems could improve pattern recognition of disease spread in populations and predictions of outbreaks in different geographical locations. A variable and a minimal amount of data are available for the signs and symptoms of Covid-19, allowing a composite of maximum likelihood algorithms to be employed to enhance the accuracy of disease diagnosis and to identify potential drugs. AI-based forecasting and predictions are expected to complement traditional approaches by helping public health officials to select better response and preparedness measures against Covid-19 cases. AI-based approaches have helped address the key issues but a significant impact on the global healthcare industry is yet to be achieved. The capability of AI to address the challenges may make it a key player in the operation of healthcare systems in future.

        "Abstract": "Drying characteristics of stevia leaves were investigated in an infrared (IR)-assisted continuous-flow hybrid solar dryer. Drying experiments were conducted at the inlet air temperatures of 30, 40, and 50°C, air inlet velocities of 7, 8, and 9 m/s, and IR lamp input powers of 0, 150, and 300 W. The results indicated that inlet air temperature and IR lamp input power had significant effect on drying time (p < .05). A comparative study was performed among mathematical, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy System (ANFIS) models for predicting the experimental moisture ratio (MR) of stevia leaves during the drying process. The ANN model was the most accurate MR predictor with coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and chi-squared error (χ2) values of 0.9995, 0.0005, and 0.0056, respectively, on test dataset. These values of the ANFIS model on test dataset were 0.9936, 0.0243, and 0.0202, respectively. Among the mathematical models, the Midilli model was the best-fitted model to experimental MR values in most of the drying conditions. It was concluded that artificial intelligence modeling is an effective approach for accurate prediction of the drying kinetics of stevia leaves in the continuous-flow IR-assisted hybrid solar dryer."

        "Abstract": "Genomic selection (GS) is transforming the field of plant breeding and implementing models that improve prediction accuracy for complex traits is needed. Analytical methods for complex datasets traditionally used in other disciplines represent an opportunity for improving prediction accuracy in GS. Deep learning (DL) is a branch of machine learning (ML) which focuses on densely connected networks using artificial neural networks for training the models. The objective of this research was to evaluate the potential of DL models in the Washington State University spring wheat breeding program. We compared the performance of two DL algorithms, namely multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN), with ridge regression best linear unbiased predictor (rrBLUP), a commonly used GS model. The dataset consisted of 650 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a spring wheat nested association mapping (NAM) population planted from 2014-2016 growing seasons. We predicted five different quantitative traits with varying genetic architecture using cross-validations (CVs), independent validations, and different sets of SNP markers. Hyperparameters were optimized for DL models by lowering the root mean square in the training set, avoiding model overfitting using dropout and regularization. DL models gave 0 to 5% higher prediction accuracy than rrBLUP model under both cross and independent validations for all five traits used in this study. Furthermore, MLP produces 5% higher prediction accuracy than CNN for grain yield and grain protein content. Altogether, DL approaches obtained better prediction accuracy for each trait, and should be incorporated into a plant breeder's toolkit for use in large scale breeding programs."

        "Abstract": "Intelligent humanoid robots (IHRs) are becoming likely to be integrated into nursing practice. However, a proper integration of IHRs requires a detailed description and explanation of their essential capabilities, particularly regarding their competencies in replicating and portraying emotive functions such as empathy. Existing humanoid robots can exhibit rudimentary forms of empathy; as these machines slowly become commonplace in healthcare settings, they will be expected to express empathy as a natural function, rather than merely to portray artificial empathy as a replication of human empathy. This article works with a twofold purpose: firstly, to consider the impact of artificial empathy in nursing and, secondly, to describe the influence of Affective Developmental Robotics (ADR) in anticipation of the empathic behaviour presented by artificial humanoid robots. The ADR has demonstrated that it can be one means by which humanoid nurse robots can achieve expressions of more relatable artificial empathy. This will be one of the vital models for intelligent humanoid robots currently in nurse robot development for the healthcare industry. A discussion of IHRs demonstrating artificial empathy is critical to nursing practice today, particularly in healthcare settings dense with technology."

Tens of thousands of people are injured in Australia every year and may experience significant disability. Associated economic costs are substantial. There is little literature on the health service utilization patterns of MVA patients. To fill this gap, this study has been designed to investigate temporal patterns of psychology and physiotherapy service utilization following transport-related injuries. Method: De-identified compensation data was provided by the Australian Transport Accident Commission. Utilization of physiotherapy and psychology services was analysed. The datasets contained 788 psychology and 3115 physiotherapy claimants and 22,522 and 118,453 episodes of service utilization, respectively. 582 claimants used both services, and their data were preprocessed to generate multidimensional time series. Time series clustering was applied using a mixture of hidden Markov models to identify the main distinct patterns of service utilization. Combinations of hidden states and clusters were evaluated and optimized using the Bayesian information criterion and interpretability. Cluster membership was further investigated using static covariates and multinomial logistic regression, and classified using high-performing classifiers (extreme gradient boosting machine, random forest and support vector machine) with 5-fold cross-validation. Results: Four clusters of claimants were obtained from the clustering of the time series of service utilization. Service volumes and costs increased progressively from clusters 1 to 4. Membership of cluster 1 was positively associated with nerve damage and negatively associated with severe ABI and spinal injuries. Cluster 3 was positively associated with severe ABI, brain/head injury and psychiatric injury. Cluster 4 was positively associated with internal injuries. The classifiers were capable of classifying cluster membership with moderate to strong performance (AUC: 0.62-0.96). Conclusion: The available time series of post-accident psychology and physiotherapy service utilization were coalesced into four clusters that were clearly distinct in terms of patterns of utilization. In addition, pre-treatment covariates allowed prediction of a claimant's post-accident service utilization with reasonable accuracy. Such results can be useful for a range of decision-making processes, including the design of interventions aimed at improving claimant care and recovery."

        "Title": "Cartesian genetic programming for diagnosis of Parkinson disease through handwriting analysis: Performance vs. interpretability issues",
        "Author": "A Parziale",
        "Abstract": "In the last decades, early disease identification through non-invasive and automatic methodologies has gathered increasing interest from the scientific community. Among others, Parkinson's disease (PD) has received special attention in that it is a severe and progressive neuro-degenerative disease. As a consequence, early diagnosis would provide more effective and prompt care strategies, that cloud successfully influence patients' life expectancy. However, the most performing systems implement the so called black-box approach, which do not provide explicit rules to reach a decision. This lack of interpretability, has hampered the acceptance of those systems by clinicians and their deployment on the field. In this context, we perform a thorough comparison of different machine learning (ML) techniques, whose classification results are characterized by different levels of interpretability. Such techniques were applied for automatically identify PD patients through the analysis of handwriting and drawing samples. Results analysis shows that white-box approaches, such as Cartesian Genetic Programming and Decision Tree, allow to reach a twofold goal: support the diagnosis of PD and obtain explicit classification models, on which only a subset of features (related to specific tasks) were identified and exploited for classification. Obtained classification models provide important insights for the design of non-invasive, inexpensive and easy to administer diagnostic protocols. Comparison of different ML approaches (in terms of both accuracy and interpretability) has been performed on the features extracted from the handwriting and drawing samples included in the publicly available PaHaW and NewHandPD datasets. The experimental findings show that the Cartesian Genetic Programming outperforms the white-box methods in accuracy and the black-box ones in interpretability."

        "Title": "Automated knowledge extraction from polymer literature using natural language processing",
        "Author": "Pranav Shetty",
        "Abstract": "Materials science literature has grown exponentially in recent years making it difficult for individuals to master all of this information. This constrains the formulation of new hypotheses that scientists can come up with. In this work, we explore whether materials science knowledge can be automatically inferred from textual information contained in journal papers. Using a data set of 0.5 million polymer papers, we show, using natural language processing methods that vector representations trained for every word in our corpus can indeed capture this knowledge in a completely unsupervised manner. We perform time-based studies through which we track popularity of various polymers for different applications and predict new polymers for novel applications based solely on the domain knowledge contained in our data set. Using co-relations detected automatically from literature in this manner thus, opens up a new paradigm for materials discovery."

        "Title": "Competing memristors for brain-inspired computing",
        "Author": "Seung Ju Kim",
        "Abstract": "The expeditious development of information technology has led to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). However, conventional computing systems are prone to volatility, high power consumption, and even delay between the processor and memory, which is referred to as the von Neumann bottleneck, in implementing AI. To address these issues, memristor-based neuromorphic computing systems inspired by the human brain have been proposed. A memristor can store numerous values by changing its resistance and emulate artificial synapses in brain-inspired computing. Here, we introduce six types of memristors classified according to their operation mechanisms: ionic migration, phase change, spin, ferroelectricity, intercalation, and ionic gating. We review how memristor-based neuromorphic computing can learn, infer, and even create, using various artificial neural networks. Finally, the challenges and perspectives in the competing memristor technology for neuromorphic computing systems are discussed."

        "Title": "Ensuring Business Continuity of Musculoskeletal Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Experience of a Tertiary Orthopaedic Surgery Department in Singapore",
        "Author": "Ming Han Lincoln Liow",
        "Abstract": "On February 8, 2020, Singapore raised its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level to Orange, indicating that coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) was a severe disease with high human transmissibility. Using lessons learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, the orthopaedic surgery department at Singapore General Hospital, a tertiary-level referral center, was prepared to handle this pandemic through business-continuity planning. The business that we are referring to is the \"business\" of orthopaedic surgery, encompassing clinical care, education, research, and administration. There is a lack of literature detailing business-continuity plans of surgical departments during pandemics, with new guidelines being developed. A large proportion of orthopaedic work, such as cases of fracture and infection, cannot be postponed. Even elective surgeries cannot be postponed indefinitely as it could result in detriment to the quality of life of patients. The aim of this article is to detail the business-continuity plans at our institution that allowed the delivery of essential musculoskeletal care through personnel segregation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies to ensure the provision of timely medical intelligence, the reduction of nonessential ambulatory visits and surgical procedures, ensuring the safety and morale of staff, and continuing education and research efforts were paramount. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, our posture needs to constantly evolve to meet new challenges that may come our way. Our existing business-continuity plan is not perfect and may not be applicable to smaller hospitals. There is conflict between envisioned normalcy, remaining economically viable as an orthopaedic department, and fulfilling training requirements, and educating the next generation of orthopaedic surgeons on the one hand and the need for segregation, workload reduction, virtual education, and social distancing on the other. Orthopaedic surgeons need to strike a balance between business continuity and adopting sustainable precautions against COVID-19. We hope that our experience will aid other orthopaedic surgery departments in adapting to this new norm, protecting their staff and patients, managing staff morale, and allowing the continuation of musculoskeletal care during the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "Title": "Predicting Air Superficial Velocity of Two-Phase Reactors Using ANFIS and CFD",
        "Author": "Meisam Babanezhad",
        "Abstract": "In predicting the turbulence property of gas (bubble) flow in the domain of continuous fluid and liquid, the integration of machine learning and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods reduces the overall computational time. This combination enables us to see the effective input parameters in the engineering process and the impact of operating conditions on final outputs, such as gas hold-up, heat and mass transfer, and the flow regime (uniform bubble distribution or nonuniform bubble properties). This paper uses the combination of machine learning and single-size calculation of the Eulerian method to estimate the gas flow distribution in the continuous liquid fluid. To present the machine-learning method besides the Eulerian method, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is used to train the CFD finding and then estimate the flow based on the machine-learning method. The gas velocity and turbulent eddy dissipation rate are trained throughout the bubble column reactor (BCR) for each CFD node, and the artificial BCR is predicted by the ANFIS method. This smart reactor can represent the artificial CFD of the BCR, resulting in the reduction of expensive numerical simulations. The results showed that the number of inputs could significantly change this method's accuracy, representing the intelligence of method in the learning data set. Additionally, the membership function specifications can impact the accuracy, particularly, when the process is trained with different inputs. The turbulent eddy dissipation rate can also be predicted by the ANFIS method with a similar model pattern for air superficial gas velocity."

        "Author": "Charlotte L Brouwer",
        "Abstract": "Background and purpose: The use of artificial intelligence (AI)/ machine learning (ML) applications in radiation oncology is emerging, however no clear guidelines on commissioning of ML-based applications exist. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the current use and needs to support implementation of ML-based applications in routine clinical practice. Materials and methods: A survey was conducted among medical physicists in radiation oncology, consisting of four parts: clinical applications (1), model training, acceptance and commissioning (2), quality assurance (QA) in clinical practice and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (3), and need for education and guidelines (4). Survey answers of medical physicists of the same radiation oncology centre were treated as a separate unique responder in case reporting on different AI applications. Results: In total, 213 medical physicists from 202 radiation oncology centres were included in the analysis. Sixty-nine percent (1 4 7) was using (37%) or preparing (32%) to use ML in clinic, mostly for contouring and treatment planning. In 86%, human observers were still involved in daily clinical use for quality check of the output of the ML algorithm. Knowledge on ethics, legislation and data sharing was limited and scattered among responders. Besides the need for (implementation) guidelines, training of medical physicists and larger databases containing multicentre data was found to be the top priority to accommodate the further introduction of ML in clinical practice. Conclusion: The results of this survey indicated the need for education and guidelines on the implementation and quality assurance of ML-based applications to benefit clinical introduction."

        "Author": "Matteo Maspero",
        "Abstract": "Background and purpose Adaptive radiotherapy based on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) requires high CT number accuracy to ensure accurate dose calculations. Recently, deep learning has been proposed for fast CBCT artefact corrections on single anatomical sites. This study investigated the feasibility of applying a single convolutional network to facilitate dose calculation based on CBCT for head-and-neck, lung and breast cancer patients. Materials and Methods Ninety-nine patients diagnosed with head-and-neck, lung or breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy with CBCT-based position verification were included in this study. The CBCTs were registered to planning CT according to clinical procedures. Three cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (cycle-GANs) were trained in an unpaired manner on 15 patients per anatomical site generating synthetic-CTs (sCTs). Another network was trained with all the anatomical sites together. Performances of all four networks were compared and evaluated for image similarity against rescan CT (rCT). Clinical plans were recalculated on rCT and sCT and analysed through voxel-based dose differences and γ -analysis. Results A sCT was generated in 10 s. Image similarity was comparable between models trained on different anatomical sites and a single model for all sites. Mean dose differences < 0.5 % were obtained in high-dose regions. Mean gamma (3%, 3 mm) pass-rates > 95 % were achieved for all sites. Conclusion Cycle-GAN reduced CBCT artefacts and increased similarity to CT, enabling sCT-based dose calculations. A single network achieved CBCT-based dose calculation generating synthetic CT for head-and-neck, lung, and breast cancer patients with similar performance to a network specifically trained for each anatomical site."

        "Author": "Kazumi Taguchi",
        "Abstract": "Background: During percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery (ECIRS), obtaining renal access is the most critical step to achieving effective treatment without major intraoperative complications. Among a variety of methods attempted to improve the access, robot-assisted fluoroscopy-guided (RAFG) renal access has been introduced to mitigate technical human errors and overcome challenging learning curves. In this study, we present our first experience with an automated needle targeting with an X-ray (ANT-X) device for minimally invasive (mini-) ECIRS. Case Presentation: A 75-year-old healthy woman with a 6.0 cm3 left kidney stone was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment. The patient underwent mini-ECIRS utilizing RAFG renal access without complication, and the stone was completely removed. The ureteral stent and transurethral catheter were removed on postoperative day 2, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 3. There were no residual fragments detected by CT as of 3 months after the surgery. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first report of the effective use of RAFG mini-ECIRS for a kidney stone. The overall outcome was positive, indicating the feasibility of ANT-X use for PCNL and ECIRS."

        "Author": "Alice Ameline",
        "Abstract": "For several years, the misuse of stimulant substances is increasingly observed both in the field of sport, to improve the functions of the body and therefore to be more performant, and also by non-athletes to make life more tolerable on a daily basis. Adrafinil, 2-((diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl)-N-hydroxyacetamide, is a drug designed for the treatment of narcolepsy by promoting an awakened state, and to treat alertness and neurological symptoms in the elderly. It is primarily metabolized in vivo to an active form, i.e. modafinil, 2-((diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl)acetamide. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned these two drugs in sports in 2004. The authors report an authentic case involving adrafinil and modafinil. The laboratory was requested to test for adrafinil in a hair strand collected from a woman found in possession of vials of adrafinil and suspected of trafficking. A specific method was developed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Unlike modafinil (varying from 6.8 to 13.9 ng/mg), adrafinil was not identified in the strand. The interpretation of the results was difficult because this is the first case describing human hair analysis. In order to be able to interpret the results, a self-administration study was conducted after an oral administration to a volunteer (200 mg) whose beard hair was collected 10 days after administration. The analysis of this specimen highlighted the presence of adrafinil at 0.8 ng/mg and modafinil at 0.5 ng/mg. These results demonstrate the dual identification of both compounds after a single consumption, even after administration of a low dose. According to these results, the analysis of the hair strand from the authentic case does not match with a consumption of adrafinil, in accordance with abuse of modafinil alone. Intelligence considered that this was a trafficking case of adrafinil, with no self-consumption."

        "Author": "Theyazn H H Aldhyani",
        "Abstract": "During the last years, water quality has been threatened by various pollutants. Therefore, modeling and predicting water quality have become very important in controlling water pollution. In this work, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are developed to predict water quality index (WQI) and water quality classification (WQC). For the WQI prediction, artificial neural network models, namely nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNET) and long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm, have been developed. In addition, three machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), and Naive Bayes, have been used for the WQC forecasting. The used dataset has 7 significant parameters, and the developed models were evaluated based on some statistical parameters. The results revealed that the proposed models can accurately predict WQI and classify the water quality according to superior robustness. Prediction results demonstrated that the NARNET model performed slightly better than the LSTM for the prediction of the WQI values and the SVM algorithm has achieved the highest accuracy (97.01%) for the WQC prediction. Furthermore, the NARNET and LSTM models have achieved similar accuracy for the testing phase with a slight difference in the regression coefficient (RNARNET = 96.17% and RLSTM = 94.21%). This kind of promising research can contribute significantly to water management."

        "Author": "Yan Wang",
        "Abstract": "Obtaining a valid facial expression recognition (FER) method is still a research hotspot in the artificial intelligence field. In this paper, we propose a multiparameter fusion feature space and decision voting-based classification for facial expression recognition. First, the parameter of the fusion feature space is determined according to the cross-validation recognition accuracy of the Multiscale Block Local Binary Pattern Uniform Histogram (MB-LBPUH) descriptor filtering over the training samples. According to the parameters, we build various fusion feature spaces by employing multiclass linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In these spaces, fusion features composed of MB-LBPUH and Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features are used to represent different facial expressions. Finally, to resolve the inconvenient classifiable pattern problem caused by similar expression classes, a nearest neighbor-based decision voting strategy is designed to predict the classification results. In experiments with the JAFFE, CK+, and TFEID datasets, the proposed model clearly outperformed existing algorithms."
