This gene is involved in brain development and function. \\n- \"Disorder\" refers to a condition or disease that disrupts normal functioning of the body or mind. \\n\\nTherefore, CASK Disorder is a condition caused by mutations in the CASK gene, resulting in disruptions in brain development and function. This disorder is also known as CASK-related intellectual disability, as it can lead to intellectual disability, developmental delays, and other neurological symptoms. It primarily affects females, as it is located on the X chromosome. Treatment for CASK Disorder may include therapies and medications to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.'"
