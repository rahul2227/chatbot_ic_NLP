When such patients visit psychiatric clinics for co-occurring psychiatric symptoms, the diagnostic procedure can be challenging due to a lack of accurate developmental information and a mixed clinical presentation. The same is true for those with subthreshold autistic symptoms. Although individuals with subthreshold ASD also have social adjustment difficulties of a similar degree to those with ASD, the relative clinical significance of this population is unclear. Here, data from a large national population sample of schoolchildren were examined to determine the psychiatric needs of children with threshold and subthreshold autistic symptoms. First, autistic symptoms or traits assessed by the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a quantitative behavioral measure, showed a continuous distribution in the general child population (n = 22,529), indicating no evidence of a natural gap that could differentiate children diagnosed with ASD from subthreshold or unaffected children. Second, data from 25,075 children demonstrated that having threshold autistic symptoms predicted a high psychiatric risk, as indicated by higher scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; odds ratio [OR] 200.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 152.12-264.33), and that having subthreshold autistic symptoms indicated the same (OR 12.78, 95% CI: 11.52-14.18). Having threshold autistic symptoms predicted emotional problems (OR 20.19, 95% CI: 17.00-24.00), as did having subthreshold autistic symptoms (OR 5.90, 95% CI: 5.29-6.58). Third, among 2,250 children at a high psychiatric risk, most had threshold or subthreshold autistic symptoms (21 and 44%, respectively). These findings have important implications for the comprehensive psychiatric and developmental evaluation and treatment of this patient population, whose diagnosis and treatment are often delayed, and a further in-depth study is warranted.\n",

      "2. How do the psychiatric needs of children with threshold and subthreshold autistic symptoms differ from those without any autistic symptoms?\n",

      "ANSWER\n",
      "\n",
      "CASK (Calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase) disorder is a rare genetic condition that can lead to developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autistic symptoms. It is important for individuals with this disorder to receive an accurate diagnosis as early as possible in order to receive appropriate treatment and support. Delayed diagnosis can have significant implications for individuals with normal intelligence who have autism spectrum disorders, as they may miss out on early interventions and therapies that could improve their quality of life. The psychiatric needs of children with threshold and subthreshold autistic symptoms may also differ from those without any autistic symptoms, as they may require specialized support and accommodations. Accurate developmental information and a mixed clinical presentation can also impact the diagnostic procedure for individuals with subthreshold autistic symptoms seeking treatment for co-occurring psychiatric symptoms, as it may be more challenging to differentiate between the two conditions and provide appropriate treatment.\n"

Second, data from 25,075 children demonstrated that having threshold autistic symptoms predicted a high psychiatric risk, as indicated by higher scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; odds ratio [OR] 200.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 152.12-264.33), and that having subthreshold autistic symptoms indicated the same (OR 12.78, 95% CI: 11.52-14.18). Having threshold autistic symptoms predicted emotional problems (OR 20.19, 95% CI: 17.00-24.00), as did having subthreshold autistic symptoms (OR 5.90, 95% CI: 5.29-6.58). Third, among 2,250 children at a high psychiatric risk, most had threshold or subthreshold autistic symptoms (21 and 44%, respectively). These findings have important implications for the comprehensive psychiatric and developmental evaluation and treatment of this patient population, whose diagnosis and treatment are often delayed, and a further in-depth study is warranted.\n",

      "22806002<SEP>Kenji J Tsuchiya<SEP>Reliability and validity of autism diagnostic interview-revised, Japanese version<SEP>To examine the inter-rater reliability of Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, Japanese Version (ADI-R-JV), the authors recruited 51 individuals aged 3-19 years, interviewed by two independent raters. Subsequently, to assess the discriminant and diagnostic validity of ADI-R-JV, the authors investigated 317 individuals aged 2-19 years, who were divided into three diagnostic groups as follows: autistic disorder (AD), pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and other psychiatric diagnosis or no diagnosis, according to the consensus clinical diagnosis. As regards inter-rater reliability, intraclass correlation coefficients of greater than 0.80 were obtained for all three domains of ADI-R-JV. As regards discriminant validity, the mean scores of the three domains was significantly higher in individuals with AD than in those of other diagnostic groups. As regards diagnostic validity, sensitivity and specificity for correctly diagnosing AD were 0.92 and 0.89, respectively, but sensitivity was 0.55 for individuals younger than 5 years. Specificity was consistently high regardless of age and intelligence. ADI-R-JV was shown to be a reliable tool, and has sufficient discriminant validity and satisfactory diagnostic validity for correctly diagnosing AD, although the diagnostic validity appeared to be compromised with respect to the diagnosis of younger individuals.\n",
      "23877884<SEP>Brian Reichow<SEP>Cochrane review: social skills groups for people aged 6 to 21 with autism spectrum disorders (ASD)<SEP>Background: Since autism was first described, major difficulties in social interaction have been a defining feature of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Social skills groups are a common intervention for individuals with ASD. Although a frequently recommended practice, the few studies that have addressed the efficacy of social skills groups have shown mixed results. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of social skills groups for improving social competence, social communication, and quality of life for people with ASD who are six to 21 years of age. Search methods: We searched the following databases in December 2011: CENTRAL (2011 Issue 4), MEDLINE (1948 to November Week 3, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 50, 2011), PsycINFO (1887 to December Week 2, 2011), CINAHL (1937 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), Sociological Abstracts (1952 to current), OCLC WorldCat (12 December 2011), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 16 December 2011), and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (20 December 2011). We also searched the reference lists of published papers. Selection criteria: Randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing treatment (social skills groups) with a control group who were not receiving the treatment for participants aged six to 21 years with ASD. The control group could be no intervention, wait list, or treatment as usual. Outcomes sought were standardized measures of social competence, social communication, quality of life, emotion recognition, and any other specific behaviors. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected and appraised studies for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias in each included study. All outcome data were continuous and standardized mean difference effect sizes (ES) with small sample correction were calculated. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis where possible. Main results: We included five RCTs evaluating the effects of social skills groups in 196 participants with ASD aged 6 to 21 years old. The results show there is some evidence that social skills groups improve overall social competence (ES = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.78, P = 0.003) and friendship quality (ES = 0.41, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.81, P = 0.04) for this population. No differences were found between treatment and control groups in relation to emotional recognition (ES = 0.34, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.88, P = 0.21) assessed in two studies or social communication as related to the understanding of idioms (ES = 0.05, 95% CI -0.63 to 0.72, P = 0.89), which was assessed in only one study. Two additional quality of life outcomes were evaluated, with results of single studies suggesting decreases in loneliness (ES = -0.66, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.17) but no effect on child or parental depression. No adverse events were reported. Given the nature of the intervention and the selected outcome measures, the risk of performance and detection bias are high. There is limited generalizability from the studies as they were all conducted in the US; they focused mainly on children aged 7 to 12, and the participants were all of average or above average intelligence. Authors' conclusions: There is some evidence that social skills groups can improve social competence for some children and adolescents with ASD. More research is needed to draw more robust conclusions, especially with respect to improvements in quality of life.\n",
      "23524401<SEP>Francisca J A van Steensel<SEP>Psychiatric Comorbidity in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Comparison with Children with ADHD<SEP>The present study was conducted with the aim to identify comorbid psychiatric disorders in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (n = 40) and to compare those comorbidity rates to those in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (n = 40). Participants were clinically referred children aged 7-18 years. DSM-IV classifications were used for the primary diagnosis (ASD/ADHD), while comorbid psychiatric disorders were assessed using a structured diagnostic interview, the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV, childhood diagnoses (KID-SCID). Twenty-three children with ASD (57.5 %) had at least one comorbid disorder, whereas 16 children with ADHD (40.0 %) were classified as having at least one comorbid disorder. No group differences were found with respect to this comorbidity rate or for the rate of comorbid externalizing disorders (ODD and/or CD). However, children with ASD had more comorbid internalizing disorders compared to children with ADHD. More specifically, children with ASD had higher rates of anxiety disorders, but not mood disorders. No associations between comorbidity and age or between comorbidity and the intelligence quotient was found. It is important for clinicians to always be aware of, and screen for, comorbidity, and to consider treatment for these comorbid disorders. In addition, research should focus on establishing valid and reliable screening tools as well as effective treatment options for these comorbid disorders.\n",
